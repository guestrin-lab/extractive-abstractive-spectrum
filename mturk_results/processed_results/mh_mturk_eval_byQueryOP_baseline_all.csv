16,156,"[""Carmen Miranda\nCarmen Miranda (born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha; February 9, 1909 ‚Äì August 5, 1955), was a Portuguese-born Brazilian samba singer, dancer, Broadway actress, and film star who was popular from the 1930s to the 1950s. Nicknamed 'The Brazilian Bombshell', Miranda is noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in her American films. As a young woman, she designed hats in a boutique before making her first recordings with composer Josu√© de Barros in 1929. Miranda's 1930 recording of 'Ta√≠ (Pra Voc√™ Gostar de Mim)', written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba. During the 1930s Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian 'chanchadas', films celebrating Brazilian music, dance, and the country's carnival culture. ' Hello, Hello Brazil!' and 'Hello, Hello, Carnival!' embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical 'Banana da Terra' (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her 'Baiana' image, inspired by African-Brazilians from the northeastern state of Bahia. In 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in 'The Streets of Paris' after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, 'Down Argentine Way' with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Lusophone accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's 'The Gang's All Here,' which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States. Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical 'Brazilian Bombshell' image she had cultivated, and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. In 1941 she was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her hand and footprints in the courtyard of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and was the first South American honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Miranda is considered the precursor of Brazil's 1960s Tropicalismo cultural movement. \x1b[92m[0] A museum was built in Rio de Janeiro in her honor, and in 1995 she was the subject of the documentary .\x1b[0m ""]",When did the performer of song Yipsee-I-O die?,"The performer of the song ""Yipsee-I-O"" passed away on August 8, 1995 [92m[0][0m.","The performer of the song ""Yipsee-I-O"" passed away on August 8, 1995.","['The performer of the song ""Yipsee-I-O"" passed away on August 8, 1995 \x1b[92m[0]\x1b[0m.']","['The performer of the song ""Yipsee-I-O"" passed away on August 8, 1995.']",{'0': {'citation_numbers': [0]}},No Failure,Post Hoc,,,,JDbKqDU0kVcpzSa,[109.857435703278],2024-09-04 19:07:43.688811+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0}]","[{""coverage"":0,""sentence_id"":0}]",[True],3,3

91,117,"[""https://travsd.wordpress.com/2022/05/01/for-may-day-a-round-up-of-robin-hoods/\nI am not a knee-jerk Kevin Costner hater like so many are. I think he is a good actor and a greater star, though he is naturally best in the right roles, which have tended to be cowboys or other All-American types. I also don‚Äôt object to an Americanizing of Robin Hood, at least not as far as accents go. It is of course manifestly a tale of Ye Olde England, but Hollywood has told many a Roman epic starring actors from Ohio, and let us not forget Tony Curtis in ANYTHING historical. So on the face of it, I didn‚Äôt mind his casting as Robin Hood as many did, at least not in terms of his performance. But there is something VERY absurd about him in the traditional Robin Hood outfit, which looked like the sort of thing he might turn up to a costume party in. If they had gotten more creative with the costume, something more along the lines of Russell Crowe‚Äôs 20 years later, it might have worked better. As it was, there was a good bit of critical ridicule at the time. The fact that Costner was then still at his height certainly cushioned the blowback, and the film was a financial success, much like his other hits of the time. It had plenty to commend it. The casting of Morgan Freeman as his Muslim war-buddy seemed like a masterstroke of inclusion at the time (even if in retrospect it seems more in line with Hollywood‚Äôs long tradition of magical, if expendable, black sidekicks). Naturally, Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham is genius. Sean Connery‚Äôs cameo as King Richard is inspired stunt casting. And there‚Äôs also Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Christian Slater, the divine Geraldine McEwan, and Jack Wild (of H.R. Pufnstuf and Oliver). I‚Äôm inclined to think of this as the first 'modern' telling of the Robin Hood tale, for what it‚Äôs worth. Still, one can see it as an early chink in Kevin Costner‚Äôs armor. \x1b[92m[2] The film was directed by Kevin Reynolds, who later helmed Waterworld (1995), which proved the true turning point southward.\x1b[0m "", 'Gordon Douglas (director)\n\x1b[92m[1] Gordon Douglas( December 15, 1907 ‚Äì September 29, 1993) was an American film director, who directed many different genres of films over the course of a five- decade career in motion pictures.\x1b[0m He was a native of New York City.

He was the youngest of the three sons of Arthur Richardson (1866-1928) and his wife, Lydia Susie (Russell) Richardson (1870-abt.1953). His brothers were Christopher Richardson (1893-1932) and Ambrose Richardson (1896-1971). "", ""Ralph Richardson\n\x1b[92m[1] Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 ‚Äì 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century.\x1b[0m He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. \x1b[92m[3] In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company.\x1b[0m There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. \x1b[92m[2] Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931.\x1b[0m He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.

This film focuses on the development of the relationship between Bella Swan (a teenage girl) and Edward Cullen (a vampire), and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a coven of evil vampires. The project was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures, during which time a screen adaptation that differed significantly from the novel was written. Summit Entertainment acquired the rights to the novel after three years of the project's stagnant development. Melissa Rosenberg wrote a new adaptation of the novel shortly before the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike and sought to be faithful to the novel's storyline. Principal photography took 44 days and was completed on May 2, 2008; the film was primarily shot in Oregon. 'Twilight' was theatrically released on November 21, 2008; it grossed over US$393 million worldwide. It was released on DVD March 21, 2009 and became the most purchased DVD of the year. The soundtrack was released on November 4, 2008. \x1b[92m[6] Following the film's success, 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse', the next two novels in the series, were produced as films the following year.\x1b[0m "", ""Robert Altman\nRobert Bernard Altman (February 20, 1925 ‚Äì November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a 'maverick' in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. \x1b[92m[8] He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema.\x1b[0m His style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a 'subversive' twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. \x1b[92m[7] Altman developed a reputation for being 'anti-Hollywood' and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style.\x1b[0m However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity. He preferred large ensemble casts for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic Pauline Kael, writing about his directing style, said that Altman could 'make film fireworks out of next to nothing.' In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman's body of work with an Academy Honorary Award. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations.

The Pride and the Passion wasn't a box office success, and director-producer Stanley Kramer called it 'one of the most difficult and disappointing experiences' of his career.

The film's storyline concerns a British Royal Navy artillery officer (Grant) who has orders to retrieve a huge siege cannon from Spain and transport it by ship to British forces. But first, the leader of the Spanish guerrillas (Sinatra) wants to transport the weapon 1,000 km across Spain to help in the recapture of the city of √Åvila from the occupying French before he releases it to the British. Most of the film deals with the hardships of transporting the big gun to √Åvila across rivers and through mountains, while also evading the occupying French forces that have been ordered to find it. A subplot concerns the struggle for the love of the Spanish woman Juana (Loren) by the two male protagonists. The screen story and screenplay by Edna Anhalt and Edward Anhalt was loosely based on the 1933 novel 'The Gun' by C. S. Forester. Earl Felton did an uncredited screenplay re-write, George Antheil composed the music score, while Saul Bass designed the opening title sequence. The film's music score was the last important work by George Antheil, once famous as the 'bad boy of music' in the 1920s. It is the only one of Antheil's many film scores to have been preserved on a commercial soundtrack recording. "", ""Stanley Kramer\n\x1b[92m[3] Stanley Earl Kramer (September 29, 1913February 19, 2001) was an American film director and producer, responsible for making many of Hollywood's most famous 'message films'.\x1b[0m As an independent producer and director, he brought attention to topical social issues that most studios avoided. Among the subjects covered in his films were racism (in 'The Defiant Ones' and 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'), nuclear war (in 'On the Beach'), greed (in 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'), creationism vs. evolution (in 'Inherit the Wind') and the causes and effects of fascism (in 'Judgment at Nuremberg'). His other notable films included 'High Noon' (1952, as producer), 'The Caine Mutiny' (1954, as producer), and 'Ship of Fools' (1965). Director Steven Spielberg described him as an 'incredibly talented visionary', and 'one of our great filmmakers, not just for the art and passion he put on screen, but for the impact he has made on the conscience of the world.' Kramer was recognized for his fierce independence as a producer-director, with author Victor Navasky writing that 'among the independents . . . none seemed more vocal, more liberal, more pugnacious than young Stanley Kramer.' His friend, Kevin Spacey, during his acceptance speech at the 2015 Golden Globes, honored Kramer's work, calling him 'one of the great filmmakers of all time.' Despite uneven critical reception, both then and now, Kramer's body of work has received many awards, including 16 Academy Awards and 80 nominations, and he was nominated nine times as either producer or director. In 1961, he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival. In 1998, he was awarded the first NAACP Vanguard Award in recognition of 'the strong social themes that ran through his body of work'. In 2002, the Stanley Kramer Award was created, to be awarded to recipients whose work 'dramatically illustrates provocative social issues'.

164,200,"[""Fast, Cheap & Out of Control\n\x1b[92m[0] Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a 1997 film by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris.\x1b[0m It profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, who is a lion tamer; George Mendon√ßa, who created topiaries at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, including giraffes made out of boxwood; Ray Mendez, a hairless mole-rats expert; and Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. \x1b[92m[6] scientist who has designed bug-like robots.\x1b[0m The film's musical score is by composer Caleb Sampson, and is performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. \x1b[92m[4] In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] The invention is called the Interrotron.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[5] His four subjects narrate the film in their own words.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'.\x1b[0m In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. \x1b[92m[7] The film is extensively cut with scenes from older films and television shows.\x1b[0m The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover's idol Clyde Beatty appears from portions of his film 'Darkest Africa' and a malicious robot appears in scenes from 'Zombies of the Stratosphere'. After using the first moments in the film to establish his characters one by one, with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another, in order to correlate the themes which the four subjects have in common. \x1b[92m[8] The title of the film is a play on the old engineer's adage that out of 'fast,cheap,' and 'reliable,' you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car).\x1b[0m Rodney Brooks, the robot scientist from MIT, wrote a paper in which he speculates that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space, instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring. \x1b[92m[3] The paper was fully titled 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System', and published in the 'Journal of the British Interplanetary Society' in 1989.\x1b[0m The film is available on VHS, DVD; the soundtrack by Caleb Sampson is available on CD.

The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia. Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. \x1b[92m[0] The empire's capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain.\x1b[0m Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga (modern Odisha), which he conquered in about 260 BCE. In about 263 BCE, he converted to Buddhism after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War, which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations. He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia, and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha. Beyond the Edicts of Ashoka, biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later, such as the 2nd-century CE 'Ashokavadana'Narrative of Ashoka, a part of the 'Divyavadana'), and in the Sri Lankan text 'Mahavamsa'Great Chronicle). The emblem of the modern Republic of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka. His Sanskrit name  means 'painless, without sorrow' (the 'a' privativum and '≈õokapain, distress'). In his edicts, he is referred to as ' (Pali ' or 'the Beloved of the Gods'), and ' (Pali ' or 'He who regards everyone with affection'). His fondness for his name's connection to the 'Saraca asoca' tree, or 'Ashoka tree', is also referenced in the 'Ashokavadana'. In 'The Outline of History' (1920), H.G. Wells wrote, 'Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Ashoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star.'

Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. \x1b[92m[3] On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music.\x1b[0m Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation 'for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.'

However, although the term 'film noir' was originally coined to describe Hollywood movies, it was an international phenomenon. \x1b[92m[4] Even before the beginning of the generally accepted classic period, there were films made far from Hollywood that can be seen in retrospect as films noir, for example, the French productions P√©p√© le Moko (1937), directed by Julien Duvivier, and Le Jour se l√®ve (1939), directed by Marcel Carn√©.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] In addition, Mexico experienced a vibrant film noir period from roughly 1946 to 1952, which was around the same time film noir was blossoming in the United States.\x1b[0m "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/film_noir\nDuring the classic period, there were many films produced in Europe, particularly in France, that share elements of style, theme, and sensibility with American films noir and may themselves be included in the genre's canon. In certain cases, the interrelationship with Hollywood noir is obvious: American-born director Jules Dassin moved to France in the early 1950s as a result of the Hollywood blacklist, and made one of the most famous French film noirs, Rififi (1955). Other well-known French films often classified as noir include Quai des Orf√®vres (1947) and Les Diaboliques (1955), both directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot.

You have a better chance of a smooth pregnancy when your disease isn't flaring or when you haven't started a new treatment. Talk to both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist. Here are some things you may discuss before becoming pregnant: \x1b[92m[4] Medications for Crohn's don't usually affect a woman's chance of becoming pregnant\x1b[0m. But some treatments -- such as sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) -- can affect a man's fertility. So men with Crohn's who hope to become fathers should talk to their doctors about changing medication. \x1b[92m[5] If you take methotrexate, your doctor will suggest you stop before your pregnancy\x1b[0m. The drug can harm the baby. Men, too, should stop taking the drug several months before conception. If you are taking steroids, your doctor may suggest you wait to become pregnant. \x1b[92m[6] If you've had surgery for Crohn's you can still have a healthy pregnancy, but it may be harder to get pregnant\x1b[0m. If you are thinking about having surgery, talk to your doctor. You may want to put off surgery until after your pregnancy. \x1b[92m[7] When you're pregnant, have regular visits with both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist to monitor your baby's health and your Crohn'\x1b[0ms. You should see a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine, because pregnancy with Crohn's is considered high risk. \x1b[92m[8] Some women say their Crohn's symptoms actually improve when they're pregnant and they have fewer flares\x1b[0m. Make sure your doctors are aware of all the medications you are taking. If you're on a drug treatment plan that works for you, they may suggest you stay on it, but they may also suggest some changes to keep you and your baby safe. Tell your doctor if you take steroids, immunosuppressives, biologics, or even antibiotics, or anti-diarrhea drugs. You'll need to stop certain types of these drugs. \x1b[92m[9] Some medications, like sulfasalazine and other drugs in the aminosalicylate class, are considered safe while you're pregnant or breastfeeding\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] If you are thinking of becoming pregnant, you should consider adding folic acid supplements to your diet even before conception\x1b[0m. These supplements will be needed throughout your pregnancy. You may need tests to monitor your Crohn's while you're pregnant. Some are OK, but there are other tests you may want to put off until after your baby is born. Your doctor can guide you on this decision. \x1b[92m[11] Ultrasounds, MRIs, and fetal monitoring devices are considered safe\x1b[0m. If you are on steroids or have moderate to severe flares while pregnant, you may have frequent ultrasounds to check on your baby's growth. X-rays and CT scans may be necessary during pregnancy. To limit radiation exposure, abdominal shielding can be used. It's considered safe to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy, where a tube with a camera is placed in your colon to look for any problems. It is probably not a good idea to have a colonoscopy. The tests take a long time and patients usually get drugs to put them to sleep. You should also avoid X-rays and CT scans if possible. The radiation isn't good for a developing baby. Discuss your labor and delivery plans with your doctor well before your due date. \x1b[92m[12] If you have fistulas, abnormal passageways between organs, or other areas around your vagina or rectum that have been affected by Crohn's, your doctor may recommend you have a C-section\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[13] If you plan to breastfeed, talk to your doctor about your medications and if they're safe for your new baby\x1b[0m. Breastfeeding shouldn't make your Crohn's worse, and it offers many health benefits to you and your baby.""]",Can you have a healthy pregnancy with Crohn's disease?,"[92m""You can have a healthy pregnancy and delivery even if you have Crohn's disease"" [1][0m. [92m""The key is to work closely with your doctor and follow your treatment plan so you and your baby can both stay healthy"" [2][0m. [92m""If you're thinking about becoming pregnant, it's a good idea to make sure your Crohn's is in remission first"" [3][0m. [92m""Medications for Crohn's don't usually affect a woman's chance of becoming pregnant"" [4][0m. [92m""If you take methotrexate, your doctor will suggest you stop before your pregnancy"" [5][0m. [92m""If you've had surgery for Crohn's you can still have a healthy pregnancy, but it may be harder to get pregnant"" [6][0m. [92m""When you're pregnant, have regular visits with both your OB-GYN and your gastroenterologist to monitor your baby's health and your Crohn's"" [7][0m. [92m""Some women say their Crohn's symptoms actually improve when they're pregnant and they have fewer flares"" [8][0m. [92m""Some medications, like sulfasalazine and other drugs in the aminosalicylate class, are considered safe while you're pregnant or breastfeeding"" [9][0m. [92m""If you are thinking of becoming pregnant, you should consider adding folic acid supplements to your diet even before conception"" [10][0m. [92m""Ultrasounds, MRIs, and fetal monitoring devices are considered safe"" [11][0m. [92m""If you have fistulas, abnormal passageways between organs, or other areas around your vagina or rectum that have been affected by Crohn's, your doctor may recommend you have a C-section"" [12][0m. [92m""If you plan to breastfeed, talk to your doctor about your medications and if they're safe for your new baby"" [13][0m.","""You can have a healthy pregnancy and delivery even if you have Crohn's disease.""

The key is to work closely with your doctor and follow your treatment plan so you and your baby can both stay healthy. If you're thinking about becoming pregnant, it's a good idea to make sure your Crohn's is in remission first. You have a better chance of a smooth pregnancy when your disease isn't flaring or when you haven't started a new treatment. Talk to both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist. Here are some things you may discuss before becoming pregnant: Medications for Crohn's don't usually affect a woman's chance of becoming pregnant. But some treatments -- such as sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) -- can affect a man's fertility. So men with Crohn's who hope to become fathers should talk to their doctors about changing medication. If you take methotrexate, your doctor will suggest you stop before your pregnancy. The drug can harm the baby. Men, too, should stop taking the drug several months before conception. If you are taking steroids, your doctor may suggest you wait to become pregnant. If you've had surgery for Crohn's you can still have a healthy pregnancy, but it may be harder to get pregnant. If you are thinking about having surgery, talk to your doctor. You may want to put off surgery until after your pregnancy. When you're pregnant, have regular visits with both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist to monitor your baby's health and your Crohn's. You should see a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine, because pregnancy with Crohn's is considered high risk. Some women say their Crohn's symptoms actually improve when they're pregnant and they have fewer flares. Make sure your doctors are aware of all the medications you are taking. If you're on a drug treatment plan that works for you, they may suggest you stay on it, but they may also suggest some changes to keep you and your baby safe. Tell your doctor if you take steroids, immunosuppressives, biologics, or even antibiotics, or anti-diarrhea drugs. You'll need to stop certain types of these drugs. Some medications, like sulfasalazine and other drugs in the aminosalicylate class, are considered safe while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. If you are thinking of becoming pregnant, you should consider adding folic acid supplements to your diet even before conception. These supplements will be needed throughout your pregnancy. You may need tests to monitor your Crohn's while you're pregnant. Some are OK, but there are other tests you may want to put off until after your baby is born. Your doctor can guide you on this decision. Ultrasounds, MRIs, and fetal monitoring devices are considered safe. If you are on steroids or have moderate to severe flares while pregnant, you may have frequent ultrasounds to check on your baby's growth. X-rays and CT scans may be necessary during pregnancy. To limit radiation exposure, abdominal shielding can be used. It's considered safe to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy, where a tube with a camera is placed in your colon to look for any problems. It is probably not a good idea to have a colonoscopy. The tests take a long time and patients usually get drugs to put them to sleep. You should also avoid X-rays and CT scans if possible. The radiation isn't good for a developing baby. Discuss your labor and delivery plans with your doctor well before your due date. If you have fistulas, abnormal passageways between organs, or other areas around your vagina or rectum that have been affected by Crohn's, your doctor may recommend you have a C-section. If you plan to breastfeed, talk to your doctor about your medications and if they're safe for your new baby.

4,162,"[""https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/what-is-multiple-sclerosis\nMultiple sclerosis, or MS, is a long-lasting disease that can affect your brain, spinal cord, and the optic nerves in your eyes. It can cause problems with vision, balance, muscle control, and other basic body functions. The effects are often different for everyone who has the disease. Some people have mild symptoms and don't need treatment. Others will have trouble getting around and doing daily tasks. MS happens when your immune system attacks a fatty material called myelin, which wraps around your nerve fibers to protect them. Without this outer shell, your nerves become damaged. Scar tissue may form. The damage means your brain can't send signals through your body correctly. Your nerves also don't work as they should to help you move and feel. As a result, you may have symptoms like: Trouble walking Feeling tired Muscle weakness or spasms Blurred or double vision Numbness and tingling Sexual problems Poor bladder or bowel control Pain Depression Problems focusing or remembering The first symptoms often start between ages 20 and 40. Most people with MS have attacks, also called relapses, when the condition gets noticeably worse. They're usually followed by times of recovery when symptoms improve. For other people, the disease continues to get worse over time. In recent years, scientists have found many new treatments that can often help prevent relapses and slow the disease's effects. Doctors don't know for sure what causes MS, but there are many things that seem to make the disease more likely. People with certain genes may have higher chances of getting it. Smoking also may raise the risk. Some people may get MS after they've had a viral infection -- like the Epstein- Barr virus or the human herpesvirus 6 -- that makes their immune system stop working normally. The infection may trigger the disease or cause relapses. Scientists are studying the link between viruses and MS, but they don't have a clear answer yet. Some studies suggest that vitamin D, which you can get from sunlight, may strengthen your immune system and protect you from MS. Some people with higher chances of getting the disease who move to sunnier regions seem to lower their risk. It can be hard to diagnose MS, since its symptoms can be the same as many other nerve disorders. If your doctor thinks you have it, he'll want you to see a specialist who treats the brain and nervous system, called a neurologist. She'll ask you about your medical history and check you for key signs of nerve damage in your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. There's no single test that can prove you have MS. Your doctor will use a few different ones to check you. These may include: Blood tests to rule out diseases that cause similar symptoms, like Lyme disease and AIDS. Checks of your balance, coordination, vision, and other functions to see how well your nerves are working. A test that makes detailed pictures of the structures in your body, called an MRI. Analysis of the liquid that cushions your brain and spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF). People with MS usually have specific proteins in their CSF. Tests (called evoked potentials) that measure the electrical activity in your brain. There is no cure for MS right now, but a number of treatments can improve how you feel and keep your body working well. Your doctor can also prescribe drugs that may slow the course of the disease, prevent or treat attacks, ease your symptoms, or help you manage the stress that can come with the condition. Drugs that may slow your MS or help nerve damage include: Beta interferon ( Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) Copolymer-1 ( Copaxone) Dalfampridine ( Ampyra) Dimethyl fumarate ( Tecfidera) Mitoxantrone ( Novantrone) Natalizumab ( Tysabri) Ocrelizumab ( Ocrevus) Teriflunomide ( Aubagio) Your doctor may give you steroids to make your MS attacks shorter and less severe. You can also try other drugs, like muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, or botulinum toxin ( Botox), to ease muscle spasms and treat some of the other symptoms. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will keep up your strength and balance and help you manage fatigue and pain. An occupational therapist can teach you new ways to do certain tasks to make it easier to work and take care of yourself. If you have trouble getting around, a cane, walker, or braces can help you walk more easily. Along with treatment, you can do other things to ease your MS symptoms. \x1b[92m[1] Get regular exercise and avoid too much heat to boost your energy\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Ask your doctor about trying yoga to ease fatigue or stress\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Take care of your emotional health, too\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] It's OK to ask family, friends, or a counselor for help with any stress or anxiety you may feel\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Support groups are also great places to connect with other people living with MS\x1b[0m.

5,65,"[""https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/osteoarthritis-prevention-1\nBy age 65, more than half of us will have X-ray evidence of osteoarthritis, a disease in which the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones at the joints breaks down and bony overgrowth occurs. For many, the result is stiffness and pain in the joint. Although osteoarthritis (or OA) is more common as we age, it is not an inevitable part of aging. As researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis, they are able to offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and lessen its impact on your life. Here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. \x1b[92m[1] If you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] If you are overweight, losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease\x1b[0m. Obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES), a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of Americans, showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. The risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. Being overweight strains the joints, particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees, hips, and joints of the feet, causing the cartilage to wear away. \x1b[92m[3] Weight loss of at least 5% of body weight may decrease stress on the knees, hips, and lower back\x1b[0m. In a study of osteoarthritis in a population in Framingham, Mass., researchers estimated that overweight women who lost 11 pounds or about two body mass index ( BMI) points, decreased their risk of osteoarthritis by more than 50%, while a comparable weight gain was associated with an increased risk of later developing knee OA. If you already have osteoarthritis, losing weight may help improve symptoms. If the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak, research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. Fortunately, \x1b[92m[4] even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles, the quadriceps, can reduce the risk\x1b[0m. To strengthen quadriceps, Todd P. Stitik, MD, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, recommends \x1b[92m[5] isometric moves and wall slides\x1b[0m. To do these, stand with your back to a wall, with feet shoulder-width apart. Then lean back against the wall, placing your feet out in front of you as far as you comfortably can. Bend at the knees, put your hands on your waist, and slide with your spine, maintaining contact with the wall until you reach a sitting position. ( Your knees should not bend more than 90 degrees). Then slowly slide back to your original position. Repeat eight to 10 times. \x1b[92m[6] If fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising, try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers\x1b[0m. Doing so may make it easier to exercise and stay active. \x1b[92m[7] The safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints, such as bicycling, swimming, and other water exercise\x1b[0m. Light weight lifting is another option, but if you already have osteoarthritis, first speak with your doctor. Suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. Injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. A long-term study of 1,321 graduates of Johns Hopkins Medical School found that people who injured a knee in adolescence or young adulthood were three times more likely to develop osteoarthritis in that knee, compared those who had not suffered an injury. People who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. To avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recommends the following: Avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. Keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. When jumping, land with knees bent. Do warm-up exercises before sports, even less vigorous ones such as golf. Cool down after vigorous sports. \x1b[92m[8] Wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability\x1b[0m. Exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. If you have a joint injury, it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage, such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. Although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis, certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. They include: Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats reduce joint inflammation, while unhealthy fats can increase it. Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils, including walnut, canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, and olive. Vitamin D. A handful of studies has shown that \x1b[92m[10] vitamin D supplements decreased knee pain in people with osteoarthritis\x1b[0m. Your body makes most of the vitamin D it needs in response to sunlight. You can get more vitamin D in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and herring; vitamin D-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs. If you already have osteoarthritis, these same steps can be useful for reducing pain and other symptoms. In addition, there are many treatments your doctor can recommend or prescribe. They range from over-the-counter pain relievers to injections of corticosteroids or other compounds and, eventually, surgery to replace the painful, damaged joint.""]",How do I reduce osteoarthritis (OA) pain?,"To reduce osteoarthritis (OA) pain, [92m""If you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis"" [1][0m. [92m""If you are overweight, losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease"" [2][0m. [92m""Weight loss of at least 5% of body weight may decrease stress on the knees, hips, and lower back"" [3][0m.

For many, the result is stiffness and pain in the joint. Although osteoarthritis (or OA) is more common as we age, it is not an inevitable part of aging. As researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis, they are able to offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and lessen its impact on your life. Here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. If you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. If you are overweight, losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. Obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES), a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of Americans, showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. The risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. Being overweight strains the joints, particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees, hips, and joints of the feet, causing the cartilage to wear away. Weight loss of at least 5% of body weight may decrease stress on the knees, hips, and lower back. In a study of osteoarthritis in a population in Framingham, Mass., researchers estimated that overweight women who lost 11 pounds or about two body mass index ( BMI) points, decreased their risk of osteoarthritis by more than 50%, while a comparable weight gain was associated with an increased risk of later developing knee OA. If you already have osteoarthritis, losing weight may help improve symptoms. If the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak, research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. Fortunately, even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles, the quadriceps, can reduce the risk. To strengthen quadriceps, Todd P. Stitik, MD, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, recommends isometric moves and wall slides. To do these, stand with your back to a wall, with feet shoulder-width apart. Then lean back against the wall, placing your feet out in front of you as far as you comfortably can. Bend at the knees, put your hands on your waist, and slide with your spine, maintaining contact with the wall until you reach a sitting position. ( Your knees should not bend more than 90 degrees). Then slowly slide back to your original position. Repeat eight to 10 times. If fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising, try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers. Doing so may make it easier to exercise and stay active. The safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints, such as bicycling, swimming, and other water exercise. Light weight lifting is another option, but if you already have osteoarthritis, first speak with your doctor. Suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. Injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. A long-term study of 1,321 graduates of Johns Hopkins Medical School found that people who injured a knee in adolescence or young adulthood were three times more likely to develop osteoarthritis in that knee, compared those who had not suffered an injury. People who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. To avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recommends the following: Avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. Keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. When jumping, land with knees bent. Do warm-up exercises before sports, even less vigorous ones such as golf. Cool down after vigorous sports. Wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. Exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. If you have a joint injury, it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage, such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. Although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis, certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. They include: Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats reduce joint inflammation, while unhealthy fats can increase it. Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils, including walnut, canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, and olive. Vitamin D. A handful of studies has shown that vitamin D supplements decreased knee pain in people with osteoarthritis. Your body makes most of the vitamin D it needs in response to sunlight. You can get more vitamin D in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and herring; vitamin D-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs. If you already have osteoarthritis, these same steps can be useful for reducing pain and other symptoms. In addition, there are many treatments your doctor can recommend or prescribe. They range from over-the-counter pain relievers to injections of corticosteroids or other compounds and, eventually, surgery to replace the painful, damaged joint.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/osteoarthritis-prevention-1'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/osteoarthritis-prevention-1\nBy age 65, more than half of us will have X-ray evidence of osteoarthritis, a disease in which the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones at the joints breaks down and bony overgrowth occurs.

You make countless trips to the bathroom, and still you feel like you have to go again. And once you're in there, instead of mindlessly going about your business, you feel burning or stinging every time you pee. \x1b[92m[1] When you get a bladder infection, it leads to cystitis, which is when your bladder swells and gets irritated\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] That's what causes the symptoms\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] A bladder infection is the most common type of urinary tract infection ( UTI\x1b[0m). Here are the parts of your urinary tract and what they do: Your kidneysclean waste from your blood and make pee. Your ureters are thin tubes, one for each kidney, that carry pee to your bladder. Your bladder stores pee. Your urethra carries pee from the bladder to outside your body. Women get bladder infections much more than men do. Usually, the infections are more annoying than they are serious, and antibiotics are the treatment. But they can travel up the ureters to the kidneys and cause more severe problems, so it's important to treat them right away. \x1b[92m[4] The main culprits are bacteria, usually E. coli\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] These bacteria live on your skin and in your intestines and most of the time, they're not a problem\x1b[0m. Everyone has them. \x1b[92m[6] But if they get into the urethra, they can end up in the bladder and cause an infection\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Bladder infections are more common in women than men for several reasons\x1b[0m. A woman's urethra is shorter than a man's, and it's close to the vagina and anus, where bacteria live. \x1b[92m[8] Having sex, wiping from back to front after you go to the bathroom, putting in a tampon, and using a diaphragm for birth control are all ways bacteria can get in\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] During pregnancy, the baby can press on your bladder, which prevents it from emptying completely and gives bacteria a place to thrive\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] After menopause, women have less of the hormone estrogen\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] That causes the lining of the urethra to get thinner and may change the balance of bacteria in the vagina, making infections more likely\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[12] When men get them, a prostate infection usually is the cause\x1b[0m.

But any blockage -- like from a bladder stone or enlarged prostate -- can prevent the bladder from totally emptying and cause infection.""]",6gbJojnMbJMuo9Z,"[43.3663103580475,15.5261378288269,25.1884670257568,17.9932088851929,14.259872674942,10.0903360843658,12.4124312400818,7.38323140144348,15.1016652584076,7.51188039779663,11.6758735179901,13.9750564098358]",2024-09-06 20:33:43.589962+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":3},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":4},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":5},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":6},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":7},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":8},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":9},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":10},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":11}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":3},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":4},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":5},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":6},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":7},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":8},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":9},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":10},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":11}]","[True, False, True, True, True, True, False, True, True, True, True, True]",3,3

9,125,"[""https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/dry-eyes-home-remedies\nIf your eyes sting and burn, look red, or feel gritty -- as if some sand is stuck in them -- you may have dry eye. This condition can happen when the tiny glands in and around your eyelids don't make enough tears to keep your peepers healthy and vision clear. When tears do their job well, they keep the surface of the eye smooth, comfortable, and hydrated, and wash away dust and debris and protect it from infection. Healthy eyes make tears all day, every day, to stay moist. But sometimes certain diseases, medications, or even just getting older causes your eyes to make fewer tears. Dry eye can also happen when your eyes don't make the right type of tears to clear out particles or keep the surface well-lubricated. What you do to make your baby blues, browns, or greens more comfortable depends on what's causing your dry eyes. In some cases, your doctor may need to treat an underlying issue or disease; or she may prescribe special medications to help your eyes make more of their own tears, or suggest ways to stop tears from draining away from your eyes too quickly. There are also steps you can take yourself to ease \x1b[92m[8] the scratchy, irritating symptoms of dry eyes\x1b[0m. Try these simple home remedies to find relief: Tears are made of oil, water, and mucus. Your eyes need all three parts to stay moist and healthy. \x1b[92m[1] Inflamed and flaky eyelids\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] may clog the oil-making glands along the edge of your lid and lead to dry eye\x1b[0m. To help ease irritation and loosen clogged oils, \x1b[92m[3] wet a clean washcloth with warm water, wring it out, and place it over your closed eye for at least a minute\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Gently press the edge of your eyelid with your finger to help squeeze out the clogged oils\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] The moist heat helps loosen up the clogged oils in the glands\x1b[0m. Wet the cloth often, so it stays warm. You may need warm compresses every day to help lower inflammation, even after your eyes feel better. \x1b[92m[7] Cleaning your eyelids, as well as the surrounding skin and hair, can help get any lid inflammation under control\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Drop a bit of baby shampoo or mild soap on your fingertips and gently massage your closed eye, near the base of your eyelashes\x1b[0m. Staring at a computer curbs the amount of times you blink per minute. So try to blink often when you're online. Follow the 20/20 rule: close your eyes every 20 minutes for 20 seconds. Another simple trick to keep your eyes moist when at the computer: Set your screen below eye level. You won't have to open your eyes as wide, which may help slow tear evaporation between blinks. Salmon and tuna, for example, or sardines, trout, and mackerel all contain omega-3 fatty acids. Research suggests these healthy fats help the oil-making glands in your eye work better, which can ease irritation. Other foods naturally high in omega-3 fats include walnuts, vegetable oils (like canola and soybean oil), and flaxseed. You can also take omega-3 fatty acids as a pill or tablet. Talk your doctor before you start any new supplement, just to make sure it won't affect any conditions you have or medicines you take. Every part of your body needs water to stay healthy, including your eyes. Drinking water helps keep them moist. But don't wait until you're thirsty to sip water. By then, you may already be slightly dehydrated. Instead, aim for eight to 10 glasses throughout the day. If you don't like plain water, any other liquid that doesn't have alcohol or caffeine will do. Water-rich foods -- like cucumbers and watermelon -- also count. One way to know if you are well-hydrated: Check your pee. If it's colorless or light yellow, you're likely getting enough fluids. This style can help protect your eyes from drying winds, which cause tears to evaporate more quickly. At home, avoid blowing air from your hair dryer, air conditioner, or fan toward your eyes. This can add moisture to dry indoor air. Putting a pan of water near your heat or radiator has the same effect. An air cleaner that filters dust and other particles may also help prevent dry eyes. Over-the-counter eye drops work just like your own tears and may help. There are many different brands. Some have preservatives added so they last longer, but using those too often may irritate your eyes. Non-preservative eye drops are also available, as well as thicker ointments.

This condition can happen when the tiny glands in and around your eyelids don't make enough tears to keep your peepers healthy and vision clear. When tears do their job well, they keep the surface of the eye smooth, comfortable, and hydrated, and wash away dust and debris and protect it from infection. Healthy eyes make tears all day, every day, to stay moist. But sometimes certain diseases, medications, or even just getting older causes your eyes to make fewer tears. Dry eye can also happen when your eyes don't make the right type of tears to clear out particles or keep the surface well-lubricated. What you do to make your baby blues, browns, or greens more comfortable depends on what's causing your dry eyes. In some cases, your doctor may need to treat an underlying issue or disease; or she may prescribe special medications to help your eyes make more of their own tears, or suggest ways to stop tears from draining away from your eyes too quickly. There are also steps you can take yourself to ease the scratchy, irritating symptoms of dry eyes. Try these simple home remedies to find relief: Tears are made of oil, water, and mucus. Your eyes need all three parts to stay moist and healthy. Inflamed and flaky eyelids may clog the oil-making glands along the edge of your lid and lead to dry eye. To help ease irritation and loosen clogged oils, wet a clean washcloth with warm water, wring it out, and place it over your closed eye for at least a minute. Gently press the edge of your eyelid with your finger to help squeeze out the clogged oils. The moist heat helps loosen up the clogged oils in the glands. Wet the cloth often, so it stays warm. You may need warm compresses every day to help lower inflammation, even after your eyes feel better. Cleaning your eyelids, as well as the surrounding skin and hair, can help get any lid inflammation under control. Drop a bit of baby shampoo or mild soap on your fingertips and gently massage your closed eye, near the base of your eyelashes. Staring at a computer curbs the amount of times you blink per minute. So try to blink often when you're online. Follow the 20/20 rule: close your eyes every 20 minutes for 20 seconds. Another simple trick to keep your eyes moist when at the computer: Set your screen below eye level. You won't have to open your eyes as wide, which may help slow tear evaporation between blinks. Salmon and tuna, for example, or sardines, trout, and mackerel all contain omega-3 fatty acids. Research suggests these healthy fats help the oil-making glands in your eye work better, which can ease irritation. Other foods naturally high in omega-3 fats include walnuts, vegetable oils (like canola and soybean oil), and flaxseed. You can also take omega-3 fatty acids as a pill or tablet. Talk your doctor before you start any new supplement, just to make sure it won't affect any conditions you have or medicines you take. Every part of your body needs water to stay healthy, including your eyes. Drinking water helps keep them moist. But don't wait until you're thirsty to sip water. By then, you may already be slightly dehydrated. Instead, aim for eight to 10 glasses throughout the day. If you don't like plain water, any other liquid that doesn't have alcohol or caffeine will do. Water-rich foods -- like cucumbers and watermelon -- also count. One way to know if you are well-hydrated: Check your pee. If it's colorless or light yellow, you're likely getting enough fluids. This style can help protect your eyes from drying winds, which cause tears to evaporate more quickly. At home, avoid blowing air from your hair dryer, air conditioner, or fan toward your eyes. This can add moisture to dry indoor air. Putting a pan of water near your heat or radiator has the same effect. An air cleaner that filters dust and other particles may also help prevent dry eyes. Over-the-counter eye drops work just like your own tears and may help. There are many different brands. Some have preservatives added so they last longer, but using those too often may irritate your eyes. Non-preservative eye drops are also available, as well as thicker ointments.

11,138,"[""https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/psoriasis-fall-winter\nFor some people with psoriasis, fall and winter bring shorter days, colder temperatures, and worsening psoriasis symptoms. Don't despair. You don't need to tough it out until spring, counting the days until you get some relief from psoriasis. Here are answers to seven frequently asked questions about psoriasis in fall and winter. Dry air and low levels of exposure to sunlight's ultraviolet rays likely cause worsening psoriasis symptoms during fall and winter. Not only are the winter days shorter, but most people tend to spend less time outside. And, when they do brave the elements, they're usually bundled up from head to toe. UVB rays are most prevalent at noontime in the spring and summer. All of these things add up to much less ultraviolet light from the sun, which may ease psoriasis in spring and summer. Experts believe that ultraviolet light hinders the rapid growth of skin cells that is characteristic of psoriasis. So you may find that your psoriasis is more likely to flare and your plaques worsen when you spend less time in the sun. Also, the lack of humidity in the air outside and the dry heat in most buildings during the colder months can rob your skin of the moisture it needs. You may be able to alleviate dryness-related psoriasis symptoms by regularly moisturizing your skin and using a humidifier at home. If possible, humidify your office, too. Definitely don't go running off to the tanning booth -- there are safer ways to get your psoriasis-easing ultraviolet rays. The medical use of light rays to treat psoriasis is known as phototherapy. A variety of options exist, which can be done in a doctor's office, psoriasis clinic, or even the comfort of your home. The form of light known as ultraviolet light B ( UVB) seems to be the most beneficial for treating psoriasis. Your doctor may prescribe a certain amount of UVB exposure depending on your symptoms. If your doctor does choose this form of light therapy for your psoriasis, ask whether you should consider purchasing a home UVB unit. Other phototherapy options for psoriasis treatment include the use of ultraviolet light A ( UVA) in conjunction with special medications that respond to these light rays. This is rarely used, however, because it can cause skin cancer. Looking for a reason to take a getaway to some tropical locale? It could be just what the doctor ordered to ease your psoriasis symptoms. The beneficial effects of a sunny vacation in the middle of winter could help ease psoriasis symptoms for a few months. Alcohol and key foods probably will not trigger a psoriasis flare. Though medical researchers have yet to prove that certain foods cause psoriasis flares, many patients report that eating certain foods seems to worsen their psoriasis. This, though, may be a coincidence. If you notice a regular connection between eating certain foods and increased skin symptoms, ask your doctor whether you can safely eliminate the suspect foods from your diet to assess any changes in your psoriasis. Alcohol binges are associated with worsening psoriasis. If you tend to smoke when you drink, you might be dealing yourself a double whammy. Evidence indicates that people who smoke tobacco products may be more likely to develop a form of psoriasis that causes pustules to develop on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Researchers have also found a correlation between smoking and more serious forms of psoriasis. If you suffer from psoriasis, an infection by bacteria and viruses can cause symptoms to flare. A strep infection, specifically, is a known trigger for guttate psoriasis, a form of the disease that causes red, droplet-shaped lesions to develop on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs. Although researchers don't know the exact cause of psoriasis, the immune system seems to play a key role in its development. Germs, illness, viruses or bacteria -- anything that temporarily revs up your immune system -- may cause your symptoms to worsen. Even something as simple as a common cold or respiratory virus may trigger a psoriasis flare. Strive to keep yourself healthy by eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, getting enough rest and keeping stress levels under control. \x1b[92m[1] Since getting the flu may temporarily alter your immune system and could worsen your psoriasis, you're wise to think about getting immunized against the flu\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] There should be no problem getting a flu shot during an active psoriasis flare -- just make sure the flu vaccine you receive does not contain any live virus\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Due to a risk of complication from some vaccinations for people with psoriasis, always check with a health care provider before getting your flu vaccine\x1b[0m. Wool sweaters are synonymous with winter for some people with psoriasis, but the itchiness of the fabric may make your already irritated skin feel worse. Consider dressing in layers made from natural plant fibers, such as cotton, to keep you warm and comfortable. If you suffer from scalp psoriasis and find that flaking is a problem, choose lighter-colored clothes to hide dandruff. Stress is a known psoriasis trigger, and some people find the holidays very stressful. Try to counter the stress with relaxation techniques to keep yourself calm. You might try yoga, meditation, biofeedback, or even a long walk. Holidays are also a time of heavy drinking, which could possibly worsen psoriasis symptoms. And then, of course, there are the many social gatherings indoors with people who may have colds or other viruses, which could worsen your lesions if you get sick. To make your holiday season an enjoyable one, make every attempt to enjoy the time spent with family and friends and follow as healthy a lifestyle as possible.

Not only are the winter days shorter, but most people tend to spend less time outside. And, when they do brave the elements, they're usually bundled up from head to toe. UVB rays are most prevalent at noontime in the spring and summer. All of these things add up to much less ultraviolet light from the sun, which may ease psoriasis in spring and summer. Experts believe that ultraviolet light hinders the rapid growth of skin cells that is characteristic of psoriasis. So you may find that your psoriasis is more likely to flare and your plaques worsen when you spend less time in the sun. Also, the lack of humidity in the air outside and the dry heat in most buildings during the colder months can rob your skin of the moisture it needs. You may be able to alleviate dryness-related psoriasis symptoms by regularly moisturizing your skin and using a humidifier at home. If possible, humidify your office, too. Definitely don't go running off to the tanning booth -- there are safer ways to get your psoriasis-easing ultraviolet rays. The medical use of light rays to treat psoriasis is known as phototherapy. A variety of options exist, which can be done in a doctor's office, psoriasis clinic, or even the comfort of your home. The form of light known as ultraviolet light B ( UVB) seems to be the most beneficial for treating psoriasis. Your doctor may prescribe a certain amount of UVB exposure depending on your symptoms. If your doctor does choose this form of light therapy for your psoriasis, ask whether you should consider purchasing a home UVB unit. Other phototherapy options for psoriasis treatment include the use of ultraviolet light A ( UVA) in conjunction with special medications that respond to these light rays. This is rarely used, however, because it can cause skin cancer. Looking for a reason to take a getaway to some tropical locale? It could be just what the doctor ordered to ease your psoriasis symptoms. The beneficial effects of a sunny vacation in the middle of winter could help ease psoriasis symptoms for a few months. Alcohol and key foods probably will not trigger a psoriasis flare. Though medical researchers have yet to prove that certain foods cause psoriasis flares, many patients report that eating certain foods seems to worsen their psoriasis. This, though, may be a coincidence. If you notice a regular connection between eating certain foods and increased skin symptoms, ask your doctor whether you can safely eliminate the suspect foods from your diet to assess any changes in your psoriasis. Alcohol binges are associated with worsening psoriasis. If you tend to smoke when you drink, you might be dealing yourself a double whammy. Evidence indicates that people who smoke tobacco products may be more likely to develop a form of psoriasis that causes pustules to develop on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Researchers have also found a correlation between smoking and more serious forms of psoriasis. If you suffer from psoriasis, an infection by bacteria and viruses can cause symptoms to flare. A strep infection, specifically, is a known trigger for guttate psoriasis, a form of the disease that causes red, droplet-shaped lesions to develop on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs. Although researchers don't know the exact cause of psoriasis, the immune system seems to play a key role in its development. Germs, illness, viruses or bacteria -- anything that temporarily revs up your immune system -- may cause your symptoms to worsen. Even something as simple as a common cold or respiratory virus may trigger a psoriasis flare. Strive to keep yourself healthy by eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, getting enough rest and keeping stress levels under control. \x1b[92m[1] Since getting the flu may temporarily alter your immune system and could worsen your psoriasis, you're wise to think about getting immunized against the flu\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] There should be no problem getting a flu shot during an active psoriasis flare -- just make sure the flu vaccine you receive does not contain any live virus\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Due to a risk of complication from some vaccinations for people with psoriasis, always check with a health care provider before getting your flu vaccine\x1b[0m. Wool sweaters are synonymous with winter for some people with psoriasis, but the itchiness of the fabric may make your already irritated skin feel worse. Consider dressing in layers made from natural plant fibers, such as cotton, to keep you warm and comfortable. If you suffer from scalp psoriasis and find that flaking is a problem, choose lighter-colored clothes to hide dandruff. Stress is a known psoriasis trigger, and some people find the holidays very stressful. Try to counter the stress with relaxation techniques to keep yourself calm. You might try yoga, meditation, biofeedback, or even a long walk. Holidays are also a time of heavy drinking, which could possibly worsen psoriasis symptoms. And then, of course, there are the many social gatherings indoors with people who may have colds or other viruses, which could worsen your lesions if you get sick. To make your holiday season an enjoyable one, make every attempt to enjoy the time spent with family and friends and follow as healthy a lifestyle as possible. It's the best present you can give to yourself.""]",gKMqFz1xmDEbCM8,"[6.25803351402283,3.56515145301819,3.55625486373901]",2024-09-06 21:26:41.8765+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2}]","[True, True, True]",3,3

13,180,"[""https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/nonprescription-treatments-nerve-pain\nWhatever the cause, nerve pain can be a serious and debilitating condition. People who have it often need help from a doctor and prescription treatments. There are also some nonprescription treatments for neuropathic pain that may help relieve your symptoms. You might use some of these approaches along with your prescribed treatment. If your nerve pain is mild, they may be enough on their own to manage your nerve pain. Here's a rundown of your options. \x1b[92m[1] Topical painkillers\x1b[0m. Many over-the-counter creams and ointments are sold to relieve nerve pain. They include \x1b[92m[2] ingredients that work as a local anesthetic, numbing the pain in the area where you apply them\x1b[0m. Some contain capsaicin, a painkiller derived from chili peppers. Others use different natural ingredients, like botanical oils. One advantage of topical treatments is that you can apply them precisely where you need relief. Painkilling medicines. \x1b[92m[3] Some people with neuropathic pain turn to familiar over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen, aspirin, and ibuprofen\x1b[0m. While these drugs might help with mild or occasional pain, they're often not strong enough for serious nerve pain. There's also a risk that someone with chronic pain might begin to rely on these medicines too much. So, always make sure to follow the directions on the bottle. Most painkillers should never be taken for more than 10 days. If you are still in pain and want to take them for longer than that, you need to talk with your doctor -- it may be a sign that you need a different treatment. \x1b[92m[4] Supplements and vitamins\x1b[0m. In some cases, nerve pain can be worsened -- or even caused -- by a deficiency of vitamin B12. If your doctor decides you need it, he or she might recommend \x1b[92m[5] injections of vitamin B12 or supplements\x1b[0m. Other supplements are sometimes used as treatments for nerve pain. There's some preliminary evidence that a few of them -- like acetyl- L-c\x1b[92m[6] arnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, and gamma linolenic acid -- might \x1b[0mhelp with nerve pain caused by diabetes. However, the evidence isn't clear; more research needs to be done. Always check with a doctor before you start taking a supplement regularly. Your nonprescription options include more than over-the-counter medicines. Here are some other treatments that you could try for your nerve pain. \x1b[92m[7] Acupuncture\x1b[0m. This traditional Chinese approach has proven helpful for many kinds of pain. Researchers speculate that acupuncture might release chemicals that numb pain, or that that it blocks the pain signals sent from the nerves. In studies of acupuncture on nerve pain specifically, results have been mixed. But given that it has few side effects, you could try it to see whether it works for you. \x1b[92m[8] Physical therapy\x1b[0m. Nerve damage can lead to muscle weakness and wasting. Working with a physical therapist can help reverse that -- and might help reduce pain in the process. \x1b[92m[9] Massage\x1b[0m. While the evidence that massage helps with chronic pain isn't clear, it has few risks. Some people find that it can be especially helpful with painful muscle spasms. \x1b[92m[10] Assistive devices\x1b[0m. The nerve damage that causes pain can also result in muscle weakness. You might find that using assistive devices -- like canes or splints -- can make it easier to move around and reduce pain. Depending on your case, ergonomically designed chairs or desks could also bring relief. \x1b[92m[11] Biofeedback\x1b[0m. This technique teaches you how to control bodily functions that are normally involuntary -- like heart rate and blood pressure. With practice, you can learn how to relax your muscles and reduce tension, which may help relieve pain. \x1b[92m[12] Hypnosis\x1b[0m. There's some evidence that hypnosis can help with various types of chronic pain. \x1b[92m[13] Relaxation\x1b[0m. Look into stress management techniques. Or try other approaches -- like \x1b[92m[14] yoga, meditation, or deep breathing\x1b[0m -- that will help you relax. Not only will these approaches relieve some of the stress caused by life with chronic nerve pain, but they may help with the pain itself. \x1b[92m[15] Talk therapy\x1b[0m. This might seem an odd treatment for nerve pain. But life with chronic pain can make people depressed -- and depression can make the feeling of pain more intense. Chronic pain can also lead to conflict with people at home and at work. A therapist can help you grapple with some of these issues and figure out ways to resolve them -- and help you come up with ways to stick to your treatment plan. Ask your doctor for a referral to a psychologist or a social worker. While making changes to your lifestyle is unlikely to eliminate your nerve pain, it might help -- especially when combined with other treatment. Here are some suggestions. \x1b[92m[16] Eat a good diet\x1b[0m. There's no special eating plan for nerve pain. But a well-balanced diet -- with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains -- help to ensure that you're getting the nutrients you need. Your doctor might also recommend reducing the amount of alcohol you drink -- or cutting it out entirely. \x1b[92m[17] Get regular exercise\x1b[0m. Many studies have shown that people with chronic pain who exercise feel less pain, have more energy, and have improved mood than those who don't. \x1b[92m[18] Don't smoke\x1b[0m. In addition to all of its other bad effects, smoking can reduce the blood supply to the nerves and worsen nerve pain. If you smoke, you need to quit. In some cases, sensible changes to your lifestyle have an additional benefit. They might also help treat the underlying cause of your nerve pain -- particularly with diseases like diabetes. If you're in constant pain, don't suffer and muddle through. Instead, get help from a doctor -- preferably an expert in treating nerve pain, like a neurologist or a pain management specialist. Together, you can come up with a treatment plan that will help you feel better.""]",What are non prescription treatments that I could try for nerve pain?,"For nonprescription treatments for nerve pain, [92m""topical painkillers"" [1][0m that include [92m""ingredients that work as a local anesthetic, numbing the pain in the area where you apply them"" [2][0m can be used.

People who have it often need help from a doctor and prescription treatments. There are also some nonprescription treatments for neuropathic pain that may help relieve your symptoms. You might use some of these approaches along with your prescribed treatment. If your nerve pain is mild, they may be enough on their own to manage your nerve pain. Here's a rundown of your options. Topical painkillers. Many over-the-counter creams and ointments are sold to relieve nerve pain. They include ingredients that work as a local anesthetic, numbing the pain in the area where you apply them. Some contain capsaicin, a painkiller derived from chili peppers. Others use different natural ingredients, like botanical oils. One advantage of topical treatments is that you can apply them precisely where you need relief. Painkilling medicines. Some people with neuropathic pain turn to familiar over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen, aspirin, and ibuprofen. While these drugs might help with mild or occasional pain, they're often not strong enough for serious nerve pain. There's also a risk that someone with chronic pain might begin to rely on these medicines too much. So, always make sure to follow the directions on the bottle. Most painkillers should never be taken for more than 10 days. If you are still in pain and want to take them for longer than that, you need to talk with your doctor -- it may be a sign that you need a different treatment. Supplements and vitamins. In some cases, nerve pain can be worsened -- or even caused -- by a deficiency of vitamin B12. If your doctor decides you need it, he or she might recommend injections of vitamin B12 or supplements. Other supplements are sometimes used as treatments for nerve pain. There's some preliminary evidence that a few of them -- like acetyl- L-carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, and gamma linolenic acid -- might help with nerve pain caused by diabetes. However, the evidence isn't clear; more research needs to be done. Always check with a doctor before you start taking a supplement regularly. Your nonprescription options include more than over-the-counter medicines. Here are some other treatments that you could try for your nerve pain. Acupuncture. This traditional Chinese approach has proven helpful for many kinds of pain. Researchers speculate that acupuncture might release chemicals that numb pain, or that that it blocks the pain signals sent from the nerves. In studies of acupuncture on nerve pain specifically, results have been mixed. But given that it has few side effects, you could try it to see whether it works for you. Physical therapy. Nerve damage can lead to muscle weakness and wasting. Working with a physical therapist can help reverse that -- and might help reduce pain in the process. Massage. While the evidence that massage helps with chronic pain isn't clear, it has few risks. Some people find that it can be especially helpful with painful muscle spasms. Assistive devices. The nerve damage that causes pain can also result in muscle weakness. You might find that using assistive devices -- like canes or splints -- can make it easier to move around and reduce pain. Depending on your case, ergonomically designed chairs or desks could also bring relief. Biofeedback. This technique teaches you how to control bodily functions that are normally involuntary -- like heart rate and blood pressure. With practice, you can learn how to relax your muscles and reduce tension, which may help relieve pain. Hypnosis. There's some evidence that hypnosis can help with various types of chronic pain. Relaxation. Look into stress management techniques. Or try other approaches -- like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing -- that will help you relax. Not only will these approaches relieve some of the stress caused by life with chronic nerve pain, but they may help with the pain itself. Talk therapy. This might seem an odd treatment for nerve pain. But life with chronic pain can make people depressed -- and depression can make the feeling of pain more intense. Chronic pain can also lead to conflict with people at home and at work. A therapist can help you grapple with some of these issues and figure out ways to resolve them -- and help you come up with ways to stick to your treatment plan. Ask your doctor for a referral to a psychologist or a social worker. While making changes to your lifestyle is unlikely to eliminate your nerve pain, it might help -- especially when combined with other treatment. Here are some suggestions. Eat a good diet. There's no special eating plan for nerve pain. But a well-balanced diet -- with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains -- help to ensure that you're getting the nutrients you need. Your doctor might also recommend reducing the amount of alcohol you drink -- or cutting it out entirely. Get regular exercise. Many studies have shown that people with chronic pain who exercise feel less pain, have more energy, and have improved mood than those who don't. Don't smoke. In addition to all of its other bad effects, smoking can reduce the blood supply to the nerves and worsen nerve pain. If you smoke, you need to quit. In some cases, sensible changes to your lifestyle have an additional benefit. They might also help treat the underlying cause of your nerve pain -- particularly with diseases like diabetes. If you're in constant pain, don't suffer and muddle through. Instead, get help from a doctor -- preferably an expert in treating nerve pain, like a neurologist or a pain management specialist. Together, you can come up with a treatment plan that will help you feel better.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/nonprescription-treatments-nerve-pain'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/nonprescription-treatments-nerve-pain\nWhatever the cause, nerve pain can be a serious and debilitating condition.

14,93,"[""https://www.webmd.com/ibs/diet-solution-ibs\nIf you have IBS- C, you may be concerned about what to eat. You need to keep a balanced diet while you avoid foods that trigger symptoms for you. Try a few simple tips to make your diet work better for you. An IBS symptom journal can help you and your doctor figure out which foods may trigger your symptoms. Make a habit of writing down any symptoms you might have, along with what and how much you ate beforehand. If you see a pattern with certain foods, see if you feel better when you don't eat them, or cut back on how much of them you eat. But cut foods one at a time. If you cut several foods at the same time, you won't know for sure which one may be causing your symptoms. These tips can help you come up with your own healthy new meal plan: Limit highly refined foods. These foods lose some important nutrients in the process of making them. They fill you up but don't give you the fiber, vitamins, and minerals you need. Think twice before you eat: White bread White rice Chips Cookies and pastries Boost fiber. Fiber makes stool easier to pass. It helps many people with IBS- C symptoms, but not everyone. Too little roughage in your diet can make it hard to have a bowel movement. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends 25 grams of fiber for women and 38 grams for men each day. People over age 50 may need a little less fiber (21 grams for women and 30 grams for men). You can get fiber in foods such as: Whole-grain bread and cereals Fruits Vegetables Beans Although meeting your daily fiber needs is best accomplished by eating the right foods, taking a fiber supplement can also help. Examples include psyllium, methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil. Don't shock your system with a sudden increase of fiber, though. Your body will need time to get used to it, so add a little each day. Too much at once may make you feel worse. Try increasing your intake by 2 grams to 3 grams per day. For example, if you normally eat 5 grams of fiber, try getting 8 grams on your first day and go from there. If it helps, stick with it until you're getting as much as experts recommend. \x1b[92m[1] Try prunes and liquids\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Some fruity foods that are higher in the sugar sorbitol, such as prunes, dried plums (another name for prunes), and prune juice, can loosen bowels\x1b[0m. But again, too much can cause gas, bloating, cramping, and diarrhea. Some people find ground flaxseed helps ease their IBS- C symptoms. You can sprinkle it on salads, cooked vegetables, and cereals. \x1b[92m[3] Keeping yourself well-hydrated can help, too\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Drink plenty of liquids like water and juice\x1b[0m. But \x1b[92m[5] coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcohol can dehydrate you and make your IBS- C symptoms wors\x1b[0me. Keep some carbs. Be mindful of low-carb diets. A high-protein and low-carb diet can cause constipation. You need protein, but don't cut out the carbs from fruits and vegetables. They'll help keep your digestive track working. Some simple changes may help you gain control of your IBS- C symptoms. Eat smaller meals more often. Some people with IBS- C find it helps to eat five or six smaller meals throughout the day, rather than three large ones. Don't skip breakfast. This meal, more than any other, can get your colon active. Dine at leisure. Too often we eat on the run or at our desks. But eating in a rush can trigger IBS- C symptoms. Try not to do other things while you're eating, such as drive or sit in front of the computer. The stress of multitasking may trigger symptoms, and if you eat quickly and swallow air, it can cause gas or bloating.

15,137,"['https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold_flu_stopping_germs_work\nIf you don\'t make an effort to prevent it, odds are that you\'ll catch the flu this season. For most of us it means a couple of weeks out of work or school, then life goes back to normal. But the flu can be serious, even deadly, if you have a health condition like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, or a weakened immune system. The trick is not to get sick in the first place. Here are proven ways to avoid the flu. Experts say the single best way to avoid the flu is to get the flu shot as soon as you can. The ideal time is early fall. But any time during the winter is fine if you haven\'t already done it. The vaccine is designed to protect against the flu strains health experts believe will be most widespread each season -- for example, the H1 N1 ""swine flu."" Some vaccines work against three flu strains -- you might hear them called trivalent. Others guard against four strains -- doctors will call them quadrivalent. The flu ""shot"" contains a dead virus. One kind that\'s approved for people 6 months and older goes straight into the muscle. Another uses a smaller needle that only goes into the top layer of your skin. It\'s available for people ages 18 to 64. The nasal spray, Flu Mist, contains a live but weakened form of the virus. It\'s approved for those between ages 2 and 49 who are healthy, not allergic to the flu vaccine, and not pregnant. It will again be recommended for the 2018-19 flu season. Egg-free vaccines are for people between ages 18 and 49 who have severe egg allergies. If your allergy is severe, you should get the flu shot from a doctor who can treat a severe allergic reaction -- either at your doctor\'s office, a hospital, a clinic, or a health department. Many children with egg allergies are at risk for complications from the flu, so it\'s important for them to get the flu shot. Fluzone is a high-dose version for those ages 65 and older. It\'s better at protecting an older person\'s immune system. There is a √¢\x80\x9cneedle-less√¢\x80\x9d option for people ages 18 to 64: the jet injector vaccine with Afluria, which uses a tool and high pressure to deliver the vaccine. Don\'t make excuses for skipping your flu shot. Your arm might be a little sore the next day. And you may feel a little achy or run a low fever afterward. But you can\'t catch the flu from the vaccine. It contains a weakened or killed form of the virus. \x1b[92m[1] It\'s easy to catch the flu\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] When a nearby sick person sneezes or coughs, they send out a spray of virus-laden droplets straight to your open mouth or nose\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] You can also pick it up from touching a surface -- like the restaurant table where a sick person dined before you\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Flu germs can linger on places like tables, counters, desks, doorknobs, and faucets for up to 8 hours\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] When you touch a germy surface and put your hands on your eyes, nose, or mouth, your fingers bring the virus right into your body\x1b[0m. You can try to avoid sick people, but that\'s not always easy to do, especially when you\'re in close quarters like movie theaters and malls. If you can\'t steer clear of the virus, at least use good hygiene to create a barrier against flu germs. Wash your hands with warm water and soap every time you shake hands or touch a surface that might be germ-covered. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you for times when you can\'t get to a sink. Bring along disinfectant wipes to clean any surfaces you\'re about to touch. Take extra care to not touch your mouth, eyes, or nose without washing your hands first. Sharing is wonderful, but not during flu season. Be stingy with your utensils, plates, glasses, and anything else you touch with your mouth. Wash used dishes and utensils in the dishwasher or in the sink with hot water and soap. If you want your immune system to be in good enough shape to fight off the flu and other germs, you need to stay healthy. Eat a balanced diet. Exercise at least 4 days a week. Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. All these will give your body the strength it needs to fend off an influenza attack. In addition to everything else smoking does to your body -- from boosting your cancer risk to giving you premature wrinkles -- it could make you more likely to get the flu. There\'s evidence that smokers get the flu more often than people who don\'t light up. And when they do get sick, smokers tend to have a more severe infection and a higher risk of dying from the flu. Holding off this nasty illness is just one more reason to talk to your doctor about ways to quit smoking. All these steps should keep you pretty well armed against the flu. Still, even the best defense isn\'t perfect. In case you do get sick, ask your doctor about antiviral flu drugs like oseltamivir ( Tamiflu), peramivir ( Rapivab), and zanamivir ( Relenza). They can help you get better faster. But you need to take them within the first 2 days of getting sick. If you do come down with the flu this season, look out for others. You can spread it for up to a week after you get sick. Don\'t share germs with your friends, family, and co-workers. Stay home until you feel better and your fever has been gone (without the help of medicine) for at least 24 hours. Sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. That way you can\'t pass it around. Toss used tissues after you blow your nose.

16,90,"[""https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/laser-tattoo-removal\nNearly 30% of people in the U. S. have at least one tattoo. Almost half of all millennials have one. But not all of them are happy about their decision. As many as 25% of those with a tattoo say they regret getting it. If you're in that 25%, there is good news. Laser tattoo removal techniques can get rid of your unwanted tattoo with minimal side effects. Lasers remove tattoos by breaking up the pigment colors with a high-intensity light beam. Black tattoo pigment absorbs all laser wavelengths, making it the easiest color to treat. Other colors can only be treated by selected lasers based upon the pigment color. You should first schedule a consultation with a trained professional who can evaluate your tattoo and advise you on the process. The number of treatments you will need will depend on the age, size, and color(s) of your tattoo. The color of your skin, as well as how deep the tattoo pigment goes, will also affect the removal technique. In general, this is what you should expect during a laser tattoo removal session: \x1b[92m[1] You'll be given a pair of protective eye shields\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] The technician will test your skin's reaction to the laser to determine the most effective energy for treatment\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] The technician uses the laser to pass pulses of intense light through the top layers of your skin that will be absorbed by the tattoo pigment only\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Smaller tattoos will require fewer pulses while larger ones will need more to remove them\x1b[0m. In either case, to completely get rid of a tattoo, it will take several treatments. After each visit, your tattoo should become progressively lighter. \x1b[92m[5] Laser tattoo removal is uncomfortable, but most patients don't need anesthesia\x1b[0m. Depending on the location of your tattoo, you may want to apply a topical anesthesia cream beforehand. \x1b[92m[6] Immediately following the treatment, use an ice pack to soothe the treated area\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] And apply an antibiotic cream or ointment and bandage to protect it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] You should also be sure it's covered with sunblock when you're outside\x1b[0m. Laser treatment is often safer than many other tattoo removal methods, such as excision, dermabrasion, or salabrasion because laser treatment selectively treats the pigment in the tattoo. And there are very few side effects. However, you should consider these factors in your decision: \x1b[92m[9] Your tattoo removal site is at risk for infection\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] And there is a slight chance that you will have a permanent scar\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] It's unlikely that your tattoo will be completely removed\x1b[0m. In many cases, certain colors may be more effectively removed than others. Blue and black tattoos, for example, respond well to laser treatment. \x1b[92m[12] You may end up with hypopigmentation, which means the skin that is treated is paler than the skin surrounding it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[13] You could also have hyperpigmentation, which leaves the affected skin darker than the rest of your skin\x1b[0m. Cosmetic tattoos like lip liner, eyeliner, and eyebrows may actually get darker after treatment. They do tend to fade with additional sessions. To ensure you get proper treatment and care, find a reputable dermatologist or cosmetic surgery center. If possible, get a recommendation from your primary care physician for a dermatologist or skin surgery center that specializes in tattoo removal. Since tattoo removal is a personal option in most cases, most insurance carriers won't cover the process unless it is medically necessary. Physicians or surgery centers practicing tattoo removal may also require payment in full on the day of the procedure. If you are considering tattoo removal, be sure to discuss associated costs up front and obtain all charges in writing before you undergo any treatment.""]",What should you expect during a laser tattoo removal session?,"During a laser tattoo removal session, [92m""You'll be given a pair of protective eye shields"" [1][0m. [92m""The technician will test your skin's reaction to the laser to determine the most effective energy for treatment"" [2][0m. [92m""The technician uses the laser to pass pulses of intense light through the top layers of your skin that will be absorbed by the tattoo pigment only"" [3][0m. [92m""Smaller tattoos will require fewer pulses while larger ones will need more to remove them"" [4][0m. [92m""Laser tattoo removal is uncomfortable, but most patients don't need anesthesia"" [5][0m. [92m""Immediately following the treatment, use an ice pack to soothe the treated area"" [6][0m. [92m""And apply an antibiotic cream or ointment and bandage to protect it"" [7][0m. [92m""You should also be sure it's covered with sunblock when you're outside"" [8][0m. [92m""Your tattoo removal site is at risk for infection"" [9][0m. [92m""And there is a slight chance that you will have a permanent scar"" [10][0m. [92m""It's unlikely that your tattoo will be completely removed"" [11][0m. [92m""You may end up with hypopigmentation, which means the skin that is treated is paler than the skin surrounding it"" [12][0m. [92m""You could also have hyperpigmentation, which leaves the affected skin darker than the rest of your skin"" [13][0m.","During a laser tattoo removal session, ""You'll be given a pair of protective eye shields.""

Cosmetic tattoos like lip liner, eyeliner, and eyebrows may actually get darker after treatment. They do tend to fade with additional sessions. To ensure you get proper treatment and care, find a reputable dermatologist or cosmetic surgery center. If possible, get a recommendation from your primary care physician for a dermatologist or skin surgery center that specializes in tattoo removal. Since tattoo removal is a personal option in most cases, most insurance carriers won't cover the process unless it is medically necessary. Physicians or surgery centers practicing tattoo removal may also require payment in full on the day of the procedure. If you are considering tattoo removal, be sure to discuss associated costs up front and obtain all charges in writing before you undergo any treatment.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/laser-tattoo-removal'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/laser-tattoo-removal\nNearly 30% of people in the U. S. have at least one tattoo. Almost half of all millennials have one. But not all of them are happy about their decision. As many as 25% of those with a tattoo say they regret getting it. If you're in that 25%, there is good news. Laser tattoo removal techniques can get rid of your unwanted tattoo with minimal side effects. Lasers remove tattoos by breaking up the pigment colors with a high-intensity light beam. Black tattoo pigment absorbs all laser wavelengths, making it the easiest color to treat. Other colors can only be treated by selected lasers based upon the pigment color. You should first schedule a consultation with a trained professional who can evaluate your tattoo and advise you on the process. The number of treatments you will need will depend on the age, size, and color(s) of your tattoo. The color of your skin, as well as how deep the tattoo pigment goes, will also affect the removal technique. In general, this is what you should expect during a laser tattoo removal session: \x1b[92m[1] You'll be given a pair of protective eye shields\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] The technician will test your skin's reaction to the laser to determine the most effective energy for treatment\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] The technician uses the laser to pass pulses of intense light through the top layers of your skin that will be absorbed by the tattoo pigment only\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Smaller tattoos will require fewer pulses while larger ones will need more to remove them\x1b[0m. In either case, to completely get rid of a tattoo, it will take several treatments. After each visit, your tattoo should become progressively lighter. \x1b[92m[5] Laser tattoo removal is uncomfortable, but most patients don't need anesthesia\x1b[0m. Depending on the location of your tattoo, you may want to apply a topical anesthesia cream beforehand. \x1b[92m[6] Immediately following the treatment, use an ice pack to soothe the treated area\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] And apply an antibiotic cream or ointment and bandage to protect it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] You should also be sure it's covered with sunblock when you're outside\x1b[0m. Laser treatment is often safer than many other tattoo removal methods, such as excision, dermabrasion, or salabrasion because laser treatment selectively treats the pigment in the tattoo. And there are very few side effects. However, you should consider these factors in your decision: \x1b[92m[9] Your tattoo removal site is at risk for infection\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] And there is a slight chance that you will have a permanent scar\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] It's unlikely that your tattoo will be completely removed\x1b[0m. In many cases, certain colors may be more effectively removed than others. Blue and black tattoos, for example, respond well to laser treatment. \x1b[92m[12] You may end up with hypopigmentation, which means the skin that is treated is paler than the skin surrounding it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[13] You could also have hyperpigmentation, which leaves the affected skin darker than the rest of your skin\x1b[0m.

17,112,"[""https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/braces-and-retainers\nIf you have crooked teeth and/or a misaligned bite (an underbite or overbite), there are a variety of treatments that can help straighten teeth, including braces and retainers. Many general dentists are doing basic alignment and orthodontics, but orthodontists specialize in correcting irregularities of the teeth. The dentist or orthodontist you choose will ask questions about your health, conduct a clinical exam, take a digital scan of your teeth, take photos of your face and teeth, and order X-rays of the mouth and head. An appropriate treatment plan is made based on analysis of the gathered information. In some cases, a removable retainer will be all that's necessary. In other rare cases (especially when there is an extreme overbite or underbite), surgery may be necessary. In most cases, however, braces will be needed. If braces are indeed the solution for you, the dentist or orthodontist will prescribe an appliance specific for your needs. The braces may consist of bands, wires, and other fixed or removable corrective appliances. No one method works for everyone. In their entirety, braces work by applying continuous pressure over a period of time to slowly move teeth in a specific direction. As the teeth move, the bone changes shape as pressure is applied. Braces are made up of the following components: Brackets are the small squares that are bonded directly to the front of each tooth with a special dental bonding agent or are attached to orthodontic bands. Brackets act like handles, holding the arch wires that move the teeth. There are several types of brackets, including stainless steel and tooth-colored ceramic or plastic, which are often selected because they're less obvious. Occasionally, brackets are cemented to the back of teeth, in order to hide them from view. Orthodontic bands are stainless steel, clear, or tooth-colored materials that are cemented to the teeth with dental bonding agents. They wrap around each tooth to provide an anchor for the brackets. The clear or tooth-colored bands are more cosmetically appealing options but are more expensive than stainless steel. They are not used in all patients. Some people have only brackets and no bands. Spacers are separators that fit between teeth to create a small space prior to placement of orthodontic bands. Arch wires attach to the brackets and act as tracks to guide the movement of the teeth. Arch wires can be made of metal or be clear or tooth-colored. Ties are small rubber rings or fine wires that fasten the arch wire to the brackets. They can be clear, metal, or colored. A buccal tube on the band of the last tooth holds the end of the arch wire securely in place. Tiny elastic rubber bands, called ligatures, hold the arch wires to the brackets. Springs may be placed on the arch wires between brackets to push, pull, open, or close the spaces between teeth. Two bands on the upper teeth may have headgear tubes on them to hold the facebow of the headgear in place. ( A headgear is another tool used by orthodontists to aid in correcting irregularities of the teeth; see below) Elastics or rubber bands attach to hooks on brackets and are worn between the upper and lower teeth in various ways. They apply pressure to move the upper teeth against the lower teeth to achieve a perfect fit of individual teeth. Facebow headgear is the wire gadget that is used to move the upper molars back in the mouth to correct bite discrepancies and also to create room for crowded teeth. The facebow consists of an inner metal part shaped like a horseshoe that goes in the mouth, attaching to buccal tubes, and an outer part that goes around the outside of the face and is connected to a headgear strap. Newer √¢\x80\x9cmini-braces,√¢\x80\x9d which are much smaller than traditional braces, may be an option for some. There is another method of straightening teeth that uses removable plastic retainers that may also work when crowding of the teeth is not too severe. Your orthodontist will discuss the various types of braces with you and determine which might be the best option for your situation. The time required for braces varies from person to person, depending on the severity of the problem; the amount of room available; the distance the teeth must travel; the health of the teeth, gums, and supporting bone; and how closely the patient follows instructions. On average, however, once the braces are put on, they usually remain in place for one to three years. After braces are removed, most patients will need to wear a retainer all the time for the first six months, then only during sleep for many years. Your orthodontist will want to see you about every month or so in order to make sure the braces are exerting steady pressure on the teeth. To create more tension and pressure on your teeth, the orthodontist will make adjustments in the wires, springs, or rubber bands of the braces. In some cases, braces alone aren't enough to straighten the teeth or shift the jaw. In these situations, an external appliance, such as headgear, may need to be worn at home in the evening or through the night. Some of the adjustments your orthodontist may make to your braces may make your mouth feel sore or uncomfortable. When needed, over-the-counter pain relievers like Motrin or Tylenol can help relieve the pain. If you always experience a lot of pain after your braces are adjusted, talk to your orthodontist about it; he or she may be able to make the adjustments a bit differently. The mechanical process used to move teeth with braces is the same at any age. So the benefits of orthodontic treatments are available to both children and adults who wish to improve their appearance and bite. The main differences between treatments in adults and children is that certain corrections in adults may require more than braces alone and the treatments may take longer because adult bones are no longer growing. \x1b[92m[1] If you have braces, you can continue to participate in any sport you choose\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] When playing sports where there is a possibility of getting hit in the mouth, a specially designed mouthguard will need to be worn\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] The mouthguard, made of durable plastic, is designed to fit comfortably over your braces and will protect the soft tissues inside the mouth\x1b[0m. After braces are taken off, your teeth will be thoroughly cleaned. Your orthodontist may want to take another set of X-rays and bite impressions to check how well the braces straightened your teeth and to see if any wisdom teeth have developed. If wisdom teeth are beginning to come in after braces have been removed, your dentist or orthodontist may recommend the wisdom teeth be pulled to prevent newly straightened teeth from shifting. Your dentist or orthodontist will also fit you with a retainer. A retainer is a custom-made, removable or fixed appliance that helps teeth maintain their new position after braces have been removed. Retainers can also be used to treat minor orthodontic problems. The use of a retainer is a very important part of post-braces care. Retainers, which are typically made of rubber or clear plastic and metal wires that cover the outside surface of the teeth, need to be worn all the time for the first six months and then usually only during sleep. The time frame for wearing a retainer will vary from patient to patient. The reason why a retainer is needed is that even though braces may have successfully straightened your teeth, they are not completely settled in their new position until the bones, gums, and muscles adapt to the change. Also, after long periods of time, teeth tend to shift. The cost of braces varies, but you can expect the cost for conventional metal braces to average $5,000 (or less in rural areas).

That\'s when you have bursts of fear that come out of the blue and last for a few minutes. These happen when there\'s no real danger. Agoraphobia is rare. Less than 1% of people in the U. S. have it.

Symptoms may include: Fast, pounding heart Sweating, trembling, shaking Breathing problems Feeling hot or cold Nausea or diarrhea Chest pain Problems swallowing Dizziness or feeling faint Fear of dying A lot of these symptoms are the same for other medical conditions like heart disease, stomach issues, and breathing problems. So you may make several trips to the doctor or emergency room before you and your doctor figure out what\'s really going on. Your doctor may ask: Do you find it scary or stressful to leave your house? Do you have to avoid some places or situations? What happens if you end up in one of them? He will do a physical exam and maybe some tests to rule out any other medical problems that could be to blame. Your doctor will usually treat agoraphobia with therapy, medication, or a combination. There are also some things you can do at home to feel better. Therapy. You could try cognitive therapy. It can teach you new ways to think about or face situations that cause panic. These new ways will help you be less afraid. You may also learn relaxation and breathing exercises. Sometimes your therapist may suggest exposure therapy, in which you try to slowly do some of the things that make you anxious. Medicine. There are many drugs that your doctor might suggest for agoraphobia. The most common kinds are antidepressants and anti-anxiety medicines. Doctors often start with a low dose of one of these medicines that raises the level of a ""feel-good"" chemical in your brain, called serotonin. Some of the medications that raise serotonin are Celexa, Effexor, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Prozac. You\'ll probably take medicine for at least 6 months to a year. If you feel better and no longer are stressed when you\'re in places that used to scare you, your doctor may begin tapering off your medicine. Lifestyle changes may also help. Exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. Skip caffeine and alcohol.

19,191,"['https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/peripheral-neuropathy-diabetes-pain-relief\nSome people with diabetes and the nerve pain -- or peripheral neuropathy that comes with it -- find relief in surprisingly simple ways. Sometimes a nice, warm (but not hot) bath is enough to relieve stress and nerve pain. If you have neuropathy, by the way, you might want to have someone else test the water to make sure it\'s not too hot. A massage can also help. Other people turn to biofeedback, meditation, relaxation techniques, or hypnosis -- all of which have been proven to help. "" These methods of alternative medicine have shown tremendous promise,"" says Tom Elasy, MD, director of the Diabetes Clinic at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. "" I have many patients who have pursued alternative approaches, and I get very positive feedback about the results."" It is possible, through biofeedback, to train the body to decrease the severity of diabetes nerve pain. This involves consciously controlling a body function that is normally regulated by the body -- like skin temperature, heart rate, or blood pressure. It may sound like science fiction, but evidence of the benefits of biofeedback is quite good. It\'s been used to help control migraine pain, epilepsy seizures, high blood pressure, and other common problems. How does it work? You wear sensors on your head and elsewhere that let you ""hear"" or ""see"" certain bodily functions such as pulse, digestion, body temperature, and muscle tension. The squiggly lines and/or beeps on the attached monitors reflect what\'s going on inside your body. Then you learn to control those beeps and squiggles. After a few sessions, your mind has trained your biological system to learn the skills. It is not hard to master, say experts. Meditation is a therapy offered in many pain treatment centers for diabetes and other painful disorders. Research shows that meditation can lower blood pressure and improve heart rate, breathing, and brain waves. Tension and tightness seep from muscles as the body receives a quiet message to relax. The soothing power of repetition is at the heart of meditation. Focusing on the breath, ignoring thoughts, and repeating a word or phrase -- a mantra -- makes the body relax. People describe feeling warmth, calm, even a sense of heaviness while they meditate. While you can learn meditation on your own, it helps to take a class. A teacher can guide you -- and help you reach that deeper, more relaxed state. Stress can make neuropathy pain worse, so it is important to learn to relax. Your breathing pattern is often affected by changes in emotions. That\'s why managing your breathing is an important tool for relaxation. By becoming familiar with your own breathing patterns, you can learn to control your breathing, stress level, and pain as well. First, \x1b[92m[4] find a quiet location, a comfortable body position, and a good state of mind\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Try to block out worries and distracting thoughts\x1b[0m. Relaxation techniques to help with diabetes nerve pain include: Rhythmic breathing: Take long, slow breaths. Inhale slowly, and then exhale slowly. Count slowly to five as you inhale. Then count slowly to five as you exhale. Pay attention to how your body naturally relaxes. This will help you relax even more. Deep breathing: Imagine a spot just below your navel. Breathe into that spot, filling the abdomen with air. Let the air fill you from the abdomen up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. \x1b[92m[6] Visualized breathing: Find a comfortable place where you can close your eyes\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Picture relaxation entering your body -- and tension leaving the body\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Breathe deeply, but in a natural rhythm\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] Visualize the breath coming into your nostrils, going into your lungs\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] Picture it expanding your chest and abdomen\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] Then, visualize the breath going out the same way\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[12] Each time you exhale, imagine you are getting rid of a little more tension\x1b[0m. Relax to music: Put on some music that lifts your mood and that you find soothing and calming. There are specially designed relaxation audio tapes or CDs that are perfect for this. Mental imagery relaxation: This is also called guided imagery. It is a form of ""\x1b[92m[1] mental escape\x1b[0m"" in which you \x1b[92m[2] create calming, peaceful images in your mind\x1b[0m. You also identify self-talk -- your thoughts about your illness -- and \x1b[92m[3] focus on positive thoughts and emotions\x1b[0m instead. Self-hypnosis is the path to training both mind and body to make a desired change such as controlling diabetes pain. It is a skill that must be learned from a trained therapist and involves focusing attention for a desired purpose. With practice, hypnotizing yourself can be easy. You focus your attention on an image that blocks the perception of pain -- and you feel less pain. Your subconscious has grabbed hold of that message, replaying it time and again. The mind has learned to control the body. Scientists say hypnosis seems to block nerve pain receptors in the brain. Those receptors control sensations of pain, anxiety, and discomfort. Studies have shown that pain related to cancer, surgery, back injuries, and migraines responds well to hypnosis. A growing number of people are using acupuncture to treat neuropathy pain linked with diabetes and other health-related problems. What is acupuncture? It is a practice in which fine needles are inserted into the skin to stimulate specific points in the body. Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the theory that energy flows through the body along certain pathways, called √¢\x80\x98chi\'. Illness or pain results when that energy is blocked or out of balance. The Chinese theory holds that acupuncture unblocks or balances that flow of energy. Many Western researchers say acupuncture may alter brain chemicals that affect the body and mind. Translated into the language of Western medicine, the healing power of acupuncture may come from its effect on the nervous system, on hormones, and on ""feel good"" brain chemicals called endorphins. One landmark study found that patients have reduced pain and improved movement with acupuncture. The National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization have both approved certain uses of acupuncture related to pain. Acupuncture also appears to be very safe. Relatively few complications from the use of acupuncture have been reported to the FDA even though millions of people are treated with acupuncture each year, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Still, poorly sterilized needles or improper treatments have caused some complications. It\'s important to make sure you go to well-trained and experienced acupuncturist. Your doctor may be able to help you with a recommendation.']",How can I practice mental imagery relaxation for diabetic nerve pain?,"Mental imagery relaxation is a form of [92m""mental escape"" [1][0m in which you [92m""create calming, peaceful images in your mind"" [2][0m.

Let the air fill you from the abdomen up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. \x1b[92m[6] Visualized breathing: Find a comfortable place where you can close your eyes\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Picture relaxation entering your body -- and tension leaving the body\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Breathe deeply, but in a natural rhythm\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] Visualize the breath coming into your nostrils, going into your lungs\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] Picture it expanding your chest and abdomen\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] Then, visualize the breath going out the same way\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[12] Each time you exhale, imagine you are getting rid of a little more tension\x1b[0m. Relax to music: Put on some music that lifts your mood and that you find soothing and calming. There are specially designed relaxation audio tapes or CDs that are perfect for this. Mental imagery relaxation: This is also called guided imagery. It is a form of ""\x1b[92m[1] mental escape\x1b[0m"" in which you \x1b[92m[2] create calming, peaceful images in your mind\x1b[0m. You also identify self-talk -- your thoughts about your illness -- and \x1b[92m[3] focus on positive thoughts and emotions\x1b[0m instead. Self-hypnosis is the path to training both mind and body to make a desired change such as controlling diabetes pain. It is a skill that must be learned from a trained therapist and involves focusing attention for a desired purpose. With practice, hypnotizing yourself can be easy. You focus your attention on an image that blocks the perception of pain -- and you feel less pain. Your subconscious has grabbed hold of that message, replaying it time and again. The mind has learned to control the body. Scientists say hypnosis seems to block nerve pain receptors in the brain. Those receptors control sensations of pain, anxiety, and discomfort. Studies have shown that pain related to cancer, surgery, back injuries, and migraines responds well to hypnosis. A growing number of people are using acupuncture to treat neuropathy pain linked with diabetes and other health-related problems. What is acupuncture? It is a practice in which fine needles are inserted into the skin to stimulate specific points in the body. Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the theory that energy flows through the body along certain pathways, called √¢\x80\x98chi\'. Illness or pain results when that energy is blocked or out of balance. The Chinese theory holds that acupuncture unblocks or balances that flow of energy. Many Western researchers say acupuncture may alter brain chemicals that affect the body and mind. Translated into the language of Western medicine, the healing power of acupuncture may come from its effect on the nervous system, on hormones, and on ""feel good"" brain chemicals called endorphins. One landmark study found that patients have reduced pain and improved movement with acupuncture. The National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization have both approved certain uses of acupuncture related to pain. Acupuncture also appears to be very safe. Relatively few complications from the use of acupuncture have been reported to the FDA even though millions of people are treated with acupuncture each year, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Still, poorly sterilized needles or improper treatments have caused some complications. It\'s important to make sure you go to well-trained and experienced acupuncturist. Your doctor may be able to help you with a recommendation.']",KHdznSlY7WjzguP,"[55.0872657299042,9.13586592674255,16.4586658477783,3.2919237613678,16.8150238990784,8.43182420730591,2.84082961082458,4.93636131286621,2.64008474349976,4.42527151107788,9.52927708625793]",2024-09-09 20:39:01.602458+00,"[{""annotations"":[1,1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":3},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":4},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":5},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":6},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":7},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":8},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":9},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":10}]","[{""coverage"":0,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":0,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":0,""sentence_id"":2},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":3},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":4},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":5},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":6},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":7},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":8},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":9},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":10}]","[True, True, True, True, True, True, False, True, False, False, True]",3,3
20,146,"[""https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/retinopathy-causes-treatments\nIn people with diabetes, \x1b[92m[1] high blood sugar damages the walls of the small blood vessels in the eye, altering their structure and function\x1b[0m. These vessels may thicken, leak, develop clots, close off, or grow balloon-like defects called microaneurysms. Frequently, fluid accumulates in the part of the retina used in tasks such as reading; this condition is called macular edema. In advanced cases, the retina is robbed of its blood supply and grows new, but defective, vessels -- a process called neovascularization. These fragile vessels can bleed, creating vision-impairing hemorrhages, scar tissue, and separation of the retina from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). The new vessels can also block fluid flow within the eye, producing glaucoma. It's important that anyone who has diabetes gets annual eye exams from an ophthalmologist so diabetic retinopathy can be detected early. When you visit an ophthalmologist, he or she will question you about your medical history and vision and will ask you to read an eye chart. The doctor will then directly examine your retina using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. Some of the features of diabetic retinopathy cannot be seen during a basic eye exam and require special exams. To get a better look at the inside of the eye, your doctor might administer drops to dilate your pupils and will then view the retina with lenses and a special light called a slit lamp. A test called fluorescein angiography can reveal changes in the structure and function of the retinal blood vessels. For this test, the doctor injects a fluorescent yellow dye into one of your veins and then photographs your retina as the dye outlines the blood vessels. The eye exam will likely also include a check for glaucoma and cataracts, both of which occur more frequently in people with diabetes and can cause vision problems. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy should involve both a medical doctor and an ophthalmologist. Your medical doctor can help you better control blood sugar and can treat other complications of diabetes that may worsen diabetic retinopathy, such as impaired kidney or heart function. Your ophthalmologist can directly treat retinopathy with a laser or a surgical procedure called vitrectomy, to prevent further vascular changes and preserve vision. Don't be surprised if your doctor recommends one of these treatments before you notice any vision problems: Before problems start is usually the best time for treatment. Laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy, called laser photocoagulation, works in part by creating tiny, painless retinal burns that seal off leaking vessels and reduce swelling. The number of burns the doctor makes and the number of treatments you need depend on the type and extent of your retinopathy and how well it responds to treatment. You may have to wait several months to find out if this treatment is improving your condition. Your doctor may recommend vitrectomy surgery if you have a hemorrhage that doesn't clear, if you have retinal detachment, or if laser treatment doesn't sufficiently halt the growth of new vessels. During vitrectomy, your doctor drains the gel-like substance inside the eye, allowing her to clear any lingering blood and to remove scar tissue. The vitreous fluid is then replaced with a substitute fluid. Rare complications of treatment may include blurred vision, headache, glaucoma, difficulty seeing in the dark, decreased peripheral and color vision, and bleeding. In most cases when treatment is recommended, the benefits outweigh the risks. Although both of these treatments can be very effective, your expectations for either treatment should be realistic. Typically laser or surgical treatment will not restore lost vision; however, treatment can prevent any additional loss of eyesight. If you already have vision loss, your doctor can counsel you about options for visual rehabilitation. Diabetic retinopathy can be minimized with a combination of strict blood sugar control and routine screening with eye exams -- though even with optimal medical care, it is not always possible to prevent or slow retinal damage. Studies have shown that maintaining near-normal blood sugar can decrease the chance of developing retinopathy and can help keep existing retinopathy from getting worse. Your doctor can provide you with guidelines that may include insulin and other medications, dietary modifications, and exercise. Intensive insulin therapy, which may include frequent blood sugar testing and the use of an insulin pump, may be an option. It's not always easy to stick to the disciplined lifestyle necessary to control your blood sugar; don't hesitate to tell your doctor if you need extra support to adhere to his guidelines. Routine screening offers the best hope for early detection of diabetic retinopathy. People with type 1 diabetes should have a complete eye exam within five years of diagnosis; those with type 2 should have an eye exam at the time their diabetes is diagnosed. After these initial exams, all people with diabetes should have an eye exam at least once a year. Your doctor may recommend more frequent screenings depending on the severity of retinal damage and on other diabetes complications you have. Pregnancy can precipitate or worsen retinopathy in women with diabetes who take insulin, so any such woman considering pregnancy should discuss the risks with her doctor. Your doctor will usually recommend an eye exam before pregnancy, a second exam during the first trimester, and additional exams at intervals based on the status of your retinopathy. \x1b[92m[2] Women who suddenly develop diabetes during a pregnancy (gestational diabetes) are not at risk of developing retinopathy during the pregnancy\x1b[0m. High blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and obesity can all promote diabetic retinopathy and should be treated. Smoking is also a culprit: Consult with your doctor about methods for quitting. Never ignore the symptoms of infection, which can worsen diabetic retinopathy. Cataract surgery can affect existing retinopathy, too, so discuss the timing of treatments for retinopathy and cataracts with your doctor. Researchers continue to investigate new drugs that may prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy; your doctor can provide information about the latest medications approved for these purposes. Depending on the severity of your diabetes and related complications, you may also want to discuss the options of pancreas and kidney transplants, which may protect against retinopathy. You or your child has been diagnosed with diabetes and you have not discussed retinopathy and routine eye exams with your doctor. You experience either gradual or sudden loss of vision. You have diabetes and are considering pregnancy. You are having trouble sticking to your doctor's recommendations for controlling blood sugar.

Beta-blockers are \x1b[92m[1] prescribed for patients with systolic heart failure and improve survival, even in people with severe symptoms\x1b[0m. There are several types of beta-blockers, but only three are approved by the FDA to treat heart failure: Bisoprolol ( Zebeta) Carvedilol ( Coreg) Metoprolol ( Toprol) They may be taken with meals, at bedtime, or in the morning. Food delays how your body absorbs beta-blockers, but they also may reduce side effects. Follow the directions on the label. Beta-blockers shouldn't be used if you have very low blood pressure (hypotension) or a slow pulse (bradycardia) that may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded. If you have severe lung congestion, your doctor will treat your congestion before prescribing a beta-blocker. While you are taking this beta-blocker, your doctor may tell you to take and record your pulse daily. He'll tell you how rapid your pulse should be. If your pulse is slower than it should be or your blood pressure is less than 100, call your doctor about taking your beta-blocker that day. Never stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor first, even if you feel that it's not working. When you start taking beta-blockers, your heart failure symptoms may become a bit worse while your heart adjusts to the medication. This is normal, but let your doctor or nurse know if you become extremely tired, gain more than 5 pounds, have trouble breathing, or have other signs of congestion or swelling. Once your heart adjusts, you will feel better. Dizziness or lightheadedness: This may be strongest when you get out of bed or get up from a chair. Get up more slowly. Call your doctor or nurse if these symptoms don't go away or are severe. Tiredness, cold hands and feet, headache , nightmares , trouble sleeping, heartburn , diarrhea or constipation , or gas. Call your doctor or nurse if these symptoms don't go away or are severe. Sudden weight gain . Weight gain is common as your doctor increases your medication dose. Call your doctor if you gain 3 or more pounds in 1 day, or if you continue to gain weight for more than 2 days. Increased shortness of breath; wheezing ; trouble breathing; skin rash ; slow, fast, or irregular heartbeat ; swelling of feet and lower legs; chest pain . Call your doctor or nurse right away. Severe vomiting or diarrhea . If you have these, you may become dehydrated, which can lead to low blood pressure. Call your doctor or nurse. Also call your doctor or nurse if you have any other symptoms that cause concern. A beta-blocker is often prescribed with other medications such as a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor ( ARNI), or angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB). If you have side effects after taking your medications together, call your doctor or nurse. You may need to change the times you take each drug.

Beta-blockers shouldn't be used if you have very low blood pressure (hypotension) or a slow pulse (bradycardia) that may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded. If you have severe lung congestion, your doctor will treat your congestion before prescribing a beta-blocker. While you are taking this beta-blocker, your doctor may tell you to take and record your pulse daily. He'll tell you how rapid your pulse should be. If your pulse is slower than it should be or your blood pressure is less than 100, call your doctor about taking your beta-blocker that day. Never stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor first, even if you feel that it's not working. When you start taking beta-blockers, your heart failure symptoms may become a bit worse while your heart adjusts to the medication. This is normal, but let your doctor or nurse know if you become extremely tired, gain more than 5 pounds, have trouble breathing, or have other signs of congestion or swelling. Once your heart adjusts, you will feel better. Dizziness or lightheadedness: This may be strongest when you get out of bed or get up from a chair. Get up more slowly. Call your doctor or nurse if these symptoms don't go away or are severe. Tiredness, cold hands and feet, headache , nightmares , trouble sleeping, heartburn , diarrhea or constipation , or gas. Call your doctor or nurse if these symptoms don't go away or are severe. Sudden weight gain . Weight gain is common as your doctor increases your medication dose. Call your doctor if you gain 3 or more pounds in 1 day, or if you continue to gain weight for more than 2 days. Increased shortness of breath; wheezing ; trouble breathing; skin rash ; slow, fast, or irregular heartbeat ; swelling of feet and lower legs; chest pain . Call your doctor or nurse right away. Severe vomiting or diarrhea . If you have these, you may become dehydrated, which can lead to low blood pressure. Call your doctor or nurse. Also call your doctor or nurse if you have any other symptoms that cause concern. A beta-blocker is often prescribed with other medications such as a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor ( ARNI), or angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB). If you have side effects after taking your medications together, call your doctor or nurse. You may need to change the times you take each drug. It's important that your doctor be aware of all the medications you are taking, as some may interact with beta-blockers.

22,111,"[""https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/guide/running-injuries-causes-prevention-treatment\nRunning injuries usually happen when you push yourself too hard. The way your body moves also plays a role. You can prevent many of them. Here's how. 1. Runner's knee. This is a common overuse injury. Runner's knee has several different causes. It often happens when your kneecap is out of alignment. Over time, the cartilage on your kneecap can wear down. When that happens, you may feel pain around the kneecap, particularly when: Going up or down stairs Squatting Sitting with the knee bent for a long time 2. Stress fracture. This is a small crack in a bone that causes pain and discomfort. It typically affects runners in the shin and feet. It's often due to working too hard before your body gets used to a new activity. Pain gets worse with activity and improves with rest. Rest is important, as continued stress on the bone can lead to more serious injury. 3. Shin splint. This is pain that happens in the front or inside of the lower leg along the shin bone (tibia). Shin splints are common after changing your workout, such as running longer distances or increasing the number of days you run, too quickly. Painwise, they can be hard to distinguish from a stress fracture of the shin, but the pain is usually more spread out along the bone. Also, an xray is normal. People with flat feet are more likely to develop shin splints. Treatment includes: Rest Stretching exercises Slow return to activity after several weeks of healing 4. Achilles tendinopathy. Formerly called tendinitus, this is inflammation of the Achilles tendon. That's the large tendon that attaches the calf to the back of the heel. Achilles tendinitis causes pain and stiffness in the area of the tendon, especially in the morning and with activity. It is usually caused by repetitive stress to the tendon. Adding too much distance to your running routine can cause it. Tight calf muscles can also contribute. Treatment includes: Rest Icing the area Calf stretches 5. Muscle pull. This is a small tear in your muscle, also called a muscle strain. It's often caused by overstretching a muscle. If you pull a muscle, you may feel a popping sensation when the muscle tears. Treatment includes RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Muscle pull commonly affects these muscles: Hamstrings Quadriceps Calf Groin 6. Ankle sprain. This is the accidental stretching or tearing of ligaments surrounding the ankle. It often happens when the foot twists or rolls inward. Sprains typically get better with rest, ice, compression, and elevating the foot. 7. Plantar fasciitis. An inflammation of the plantar fascia. That's the thick band of tissue in the bottom of the foot that extends from the heel to the toes. People with tight calf muscles and a high arch are more prone to plantar fasciitis. Although it may be linked to adding activity, plantar fasciitis can also happen without any obvious reason. Treatment includes: Calf stretches Rest Icing the bottom of the foot Wearing good shoes at all times (even at home or on the beach) 8. IT (iliotibial) band syndrome. This syndrome causes pain on the outside of the knee. The IT band is a ligament that runs along the outside of the thigh, from the top of the hip to the outside of the knee. IT band syndrome happens when this ligament thickens and rubs the knee bone, causing inflammation. Treatment includes: Cutting back on exercise Heat and stretching before exercise Icing the area after activity 9. Blisters. These are fluid-filled sacks on the surface of the skin. They are caused by friction between your shoes/socks and skin. To help prevent blisters: Start using new shoes gradually Wear socks with a double layer Apply petroleum jelly on areas prone to blisters 10. Temperature-related injuries. These include: Sunburn Heat exhaustion Frostbite Hypothermia You can prevent these by dressing appropriately, staying hydrated, and using sunscreen. By taking a few precautions and planning, you can prevent many common running injuries. Here are some tips for preventing injuries. \x1b[92m[1] Listen to your body: Don't ignore pain\x1b[0m. A little soreness is OK. But if you notice consistent pain in a muscle or joint that doesn't get better with rest, see your health care provider. \x1b[92m[2] Create a running plan\x1b[0m: Before beginning a running routine, talk to a trainer. A trainer can help you create a running plan that is in line with \x1b[92m[3] your current fitness abilities and long-term goals\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Warm-up and stretch\x1b[0m: Many injuries occur as a result of inadequate stretching. Before and after you run, stretch your muscles thoroughly -- especially \x1b[92m[5] your calf, hamstrings, groin, and quadriceps\x1b[0m. Also, warm up for five minutes -- by walking, for example -- before you start stretching. Stretching cold muscles may cause injuries. \x1b[92m[6] Strength train\x1b[0m: Add weight training and ab exercises to your routine. This \x1b[92m[7] strengthens muscles and develops core strength\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Cross train\x1b[0m: Mix up your fitness routine. Don't only run. Try swimming, biking, tennis, or some other activity. This helps prevent \x1b[92m[9] overuse injuries that more commonly occur when you do the same type of exercise over and over again\x1b[0m. Dress appropriately: Wear \x1b[92m[10] lightweight, breathable clothing\x1b[0m that wicks moisture away from your skin. Dress in layers. Also wear a hat to protect against the sun and cold. Be shoe smart: Wear \x1b[92m[11] proper-fitting socks and shoes with good support\x1b[0m. Remember thatrunning shoes are recommended to last for a certain mileage. If the soles of your running shoes have worn thin or are angled, you over overdue for getting a new pair. If you have foot problems, such as flat feet or high arches, consider using orthotic shoe inserts. \x1b[92m[12] Run wisely\x1b[0m: Run on \x1b[92m[13] a flat, smooth surface\x1b[0m and avoid steep hills until your body gets used to the activity. \x1b[92m[14] Be safe\x1b[0m: Run \x1b[92m[15] during the day, in well-lit areas\x1b[0m, or use a light so that you can be seen. Keep a cell phone and identification on you. If running with headphones, set the volume low enough so that you can hear cars and other noises. Run with a partner when you can. \x1b[92m[16] Weather matters\x1b[0m: Monitor the weather conditions before you go for a run. Don't run outside if it is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, below freezing, or the humidity is high. \x1b[92m[17] Stay hydrated\x1b[0m: Make sure you drink \x1b[92m[18] an extra 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 cups of water on the days you run\x1b[0m. If you are running for more than an hour, drink a sports drink to replenish electrolytes lost in sweat. Most running injuries can be relieved by following these treatment strategies. If pain and discomfort continues, see your health care provider. You may need more advanced treatment to resolve your running injury. Rest: Take it easy. If you keep running, your injury may get worse. Choose alternative ways to exercise while you heal, such as swimming or cycling. Ice and cold therapy: Apply ice packs to reduce pain, inflammation, and swelling. Compression: Wrap the affected area with tape and use splints and supports to control swelling and stabilize the affected area. Elevate: If you sprain your ankle or hurt your foot, elevate it to reduce swelling. Stretch: To reduce pain and tension of the affected area, gently stretch and massage the injured area. Pain relievers: Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) and naproxen ( Aleve), as recommended by your health care provider to relieve pain and inflammation. Don't try to push through pain. If you notice discomfort, take a break from running. If the pain continues, seek care from your health care provider.""]",How can you prevent running injuries?,"To prevent running injuries, it's important to [92m""Listen to your body: Don't ignore pain"" [1][0m.

But if you notice consistent pain in a muscle or joint that doesn't get better with rest, see your health care provider. \x1b[92m[2] Create a running plan\x1b[0m: Before beginning a running routine, talk to a trainer. A trainer can help you create a running plan that is in line with \x1b[92m[3] your current fitness abilities and long-term goals\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Warm-up and stretch\x1b[0m: Many injuries occur as a result of inadequate stretching. Before and after you run, stretch your muscles thoroughly -- especially \x1b[92m[5] your calf, hamstrings, groin, and quadriceps\x1b[0m. Also, warm up for five minutes -- by walking, for example -- before you start stretching. Stretching cold muscles may cause injuries. \x1b[92m[6] Strength train\x1b[0m: Add weight training and ab exercises to your routine. This \x1b[92m[7] strengthens muscles and develops core strength\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Cross train\x1b[0m: Mix up your fitness routine. Don't only run. Try swimming, biking, tennis, or some other activity. This helps prevent \x1b[92m[9] overuse injuries that more commonly occur when you do the same type of exercise over and over again\x1b[0m. Dress appropriately: Wear \x1b[92m[10] lightweight, breathable clothing\x1b[0m that wicks moisture away from your skin. Dress in layers. Also wear a hat to protect against the sun and cold. Be shoe smart: Wear \x1b[92m[11] proper-fitting socks and shoes with good support\x1b[0m. Remember thatrunning shoes are recommended to last for a certain mileage. If the soles of your running shoes have worn thin or are angled, you over overdue for getting a new pair. If you have foot problems, such as flat feet or high arches, consider using orthotic shoe inserts. \x1b[92m[12] Run wisely\x1b[0m: Run on \x1b[92m[13] a flat, smooth surface\x1b[0m and avoid steep hills until your body gets used to the activity. \x1b[92m[14] Be safe\x1b[0m: Run \x1b[92m[15] during the day, in well-lit areas\x1b[0m, or use a light so that you can be seen. Keep a cell phone and identification on you. If running with headphones, set the volume low enough so that you can hear cars and other noises. Run with a partner when you can. \x1b[92m[16] Weather matters\x1b[0m: Monitor the weather conditions before you go for a run. Don't run outside if it is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, below freezing, or the humidity is high. \x1b[92m[17] Stay hydrated\x1b[0m: Make sure you drink \x1b[92m[18] an extra 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 cups of water on the days you run\x1b[0m. If you are running for more than an hour, drink a sports drink to replenish electrolytes lost in sweat. Most running injuries can be relieved by following these treatment strategies. If pain and discomfort continues, see your health care provider. You may need more advanced treatment to resolve your running injury. Rest: Take it easy. If you keep running, your injury may get worse. Choose alternative ways to exercise while you heal, such as swimming or cycling. Ice and cold therapy: Apply ice packs to reduce pain, inflammation, and swelling. Compression: Wrap the affected area with tape and use splints and supports to control swelling and stabilize the affected area. Elevate: If you sprain your ankle or hurt your foot, elevate it to reduce swelling. Stretch: To reduce pain and tension of the affected area, gently stretch and massage the injured area. Pain relievers: Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) and naproxen ( Aleve), as recommended by your health care provider to relieve pain and inflammation. Don't try to push through pain. If you notice discomfort, take a break from running. If the pain continues, seek care from your health care provider.""]",lCEp5abdrghSE78,"[11.6749131679535,19.0187172889709,30.5993266105652,23.2162201404572,20.7290184497833,14.1596999168396,12.6305923461914,29.9017405509949]",2024-09-06 21:06:41.557789+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1,1],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1,1],""sentence_id"":2},{""annotations"":[1,1],""sentence_id"":3},{""annotations"":[1,1],""sentence_id"":4},{""annotations"":[1,1],""sentence_id"":5},{""annotations"":[1,1,1,1],""sentence_id"":6},{""annotations"":[1,1,1],""sentence_id"":7}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":3},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":4},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":5},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":6},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":7}]","[True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True]",1,3

24,136,"[""https://www.webmd.com/depression/summer-depression\nAh, the joys of summer: The withering heat and school vacations, when your kids give you minute-to-minute updates on their boredom levels. Isn't summer supposed to be fun and relaxing? If you've got summer depression, it isn't. For some people, summer depression has a biological cause, says Ian A. Cook, MD, the director of the Depression Research Program at UCLA. For others, the particular stresses of summer can pile up and make them feel miserable. Especially hard is that you feel like you're supposed to be having a great time. Everyone else seems so happy splashing in the water and sweating in their lawn chairs. So why can't you? And more importantly, what can you do to make this summer easier? Here's what you need to know about summer depression. Why do some people feel more depressed in summer? Here's a rundown of reasons. \x1b[92m[1] Summertime SAD\x1b[0m. You've probably heard about seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, which \x1b[92m[2] affects about 4% to 6% of the U. S. population\x1b[0m. SAD typically causes depression as the days get shorter and colder. But about 10% of people with SAD get it in the reverse -- \x1b[92m[3] the onset of summer triggers their depression symptoms\x1b[0m. Cook notes that some studies have shown that in countries near the equator √¢\x80\x93 such as India √¢\x80\x93 summer SAD is more common than winter SAD. Why do seasonal changes cause depression? Experts aren't sure, but \x1b[92m[4] the longer days, and increasing heat and humidity\x1b[0m may play a role. Specific symptoms of summer depression often include loss of appetite, trouble \x1b[92m[11] sleep\x1b[0ming, weight loss, and anxiety. \x1b[92m[5] Disrupted schedules in summer\x1b[0m. If you've had depression before, you probably know that having a reliable routine is often key to staving off symptoms. But during the summer, routine goes out the window √¢\x80\x93 and that disruption can be stressful, Cook says. If you have children in grade school, you're suddenly faced with the prospect of keeping them occupied all day, every day. If your kids are in college, you may suddenly find them √¢\x80\x93 and all their boxes of stuff √¢\x80\x93 back in the house after a nine-month absence. Vacations can disrupt your work, \x1b[92m[11] sleep\x1b[0m, and eating habits √¢\x80\x93 all of which can all contribute to summer depression. \x1b[92m[6] Body image issues\x1b[0m. As the temperature climbs and the layers of clothing fall away, a lot of people feel terribly self-conscious about their bodies, says Cook. Feeling embarrassed in shorts or a bathing suit can make life awkward, not to mention hot. Since so many summertime gatherings revolve around beaches and pools, some people start avoiding social situations out of embarrassment. \x1b[92m[7] Financial worries\x1b[0m. Summers can be expensive. There's the vacation, of course. And if you're a working parent, you may have to fork over a lot of money to summer camps or babysitters to keep your kids occupied while you're on the job. The expenses can add to a feeling of summer depression. √¢\x80\x9c This summer, we have worries about the economic crisis layered on top of everything else,√¢\x80\x9d says Cook. √¢\x80\x9c People are feeling more financially strapped. They're wondering, √¢\x80\x98 If I go on vacation, will the job still be there when I get back? '√¢\x80\x9d \x1b[92m[8] The heat\x1b[0m. Lots of people relish the sweltering heat. They love baking on a beach all day. But for the people who don't, summer heat can become truly oppressive. You may start spending every weekend hiding out in your air-conditioned bedroom, watching Pay- Per- View until your eyes ache. You may begin to skip your usual before-dinner walks because of the humidity. You may rely on unhealthy takeout because it's just too stifling to cook. Any of these things can contribute to summer depression. What can help you feel better? What can you do to make this summer different? Here are some tips on taking control of summer depression. \x1b[92m[9] Get help\x1b[0m. It's simple. If you think you're getting depressed, no matter what time of year, get help. Talk to a therapist, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Or see your general medical doctor or a psychiatrist who can evaluate whether medicines for depression might be appropriate. Never take the signs of depression lightly. Don't wait them out, assuming they'll resolve. Sometimes, what started as summer depression can turn into a longer-lasting bout of major depression, Cook tells Web MD. And even if your depression will resolve in September, that's no reason to ignore it in June. We're talking about three months of potentially avoidable misery. √¢\x80\x9c A temporary depression can still be pretty awful,√¢\x80\x9d says Cook. While the symptoms lift in a few months, the impact on your family and job can be permanent. \x1b[92m[10] Plan ahead\x1b[0m. Cook says there's one advantage to a summer depression: you know when it's coming. June is right there on the calendar. So if you're feeling OK in the spring, think about the specific aspects of your life that become difficult during the summer. What will help prevent summer depression? What's the best way to take time off from work? Would signing up the kids for summer programs or camp help relieve your stress? You'll feel a lot more in control heading into the summer if you have plans in place. Sleep. Vacations, summer barbecues, the short nights √¢\x80\x93 they can all encourage you to stay up later than usual. But not getting enough \x1b[92m[11] sleep\x1b[0m is a common trigger for depression. So make a concerted effort to get to bed on time. \x1b[92m[12] Keep up with your exercise\x1b[0m. Many studies have found that regular physical activity can help keep depression at bay. So even if it's getting too hot for your normal activities, find other ways to stay active and head off summer depression. \x1b[92m[14] Start earlier in the morning or later in the evening, when it's not so hot\x1b[0m. Consider \x1b[92m[15] fitness equipment for the cool basement\x1b[0m. If an annual membership to a gym is too expensive, consider joining one for a couple of months just to get you through the summer. \x1b[92m[13] Don't overdo dieting and fitness\x1b[0m. Don't kick off the summer with a frenzy of dieting and exercise in order to fit into last year's bathing suit. It's bound to make you unhappy and anxious. Instead, exercise sensibly and eat moderately. If you try an insanely restrictive diet, you probably won't be able to keep it up. And that √¢\x80\x9cfailure√¢\x80\x9d will just leave you more demoralized and worsen your summer depression. Protect yourself. Don't let obligations drag you down. Maybe you always host the enormous family barbecue on Memorial Day or the July 4 picnic. But if you're feeling overwhelmed, give it a pass this year. Ask another relative to host. Don't risk pushing yourself into a summer depression just to live up to tradition. Think about why. If you struggle with summer depression year after year, ask yourself if there's a reason. Do you associate summer with a difficult time in the past √¢\x80\x93 the death of a loved one or the break-up of a relationship? Have you had previous bouts of depression during the summer? Without even realizing it, you may have started to associate the summer with sadness √¢\x80\x93 an association that gets stronger every summer that you spend depressed. If you do have some unhappy connection with the summer, sorting it out could help you break the cycle. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your medication. If you're on medicine for depression, and you find that summer √¢\x80\x93 year after year √¢\x80\x93 makes your depression worse, talk to your doctor about changing your dosage. Maybe he or she could up your dose in the late spring and taper it back down in the fall. It could really help head off summer depression problems, Cook says. \x1b[92m[16] Plan your vacation carefully\x1b[0m. Before you book your plane tickets or load up your car's roof rack for your annual summer vacation, ask yourself this: Is this what you really want? Or is it an obligation you're fulfilling to a relative? Will it make you happy? Or will it stretch your finances, stress you out, and make you fall behind at work? Consider alternatives. Instead of taking a whole week off at once, might it be better to take off several long weekends spread out through the summer? Would taking time off but staying at home √¢\x80\x93 a √¢\x80\x9c\x1b[92m[17] staycation\x1b[0m√¢\x80\x9d √¢\x80\x93 be more relaxing? Don't get locked into a vacation that won't feel like a vacation. Don't beat yourself up. One thing that's hard about summer depression is that you feel so out of step. Everyone else seems to be having such a swell time. You aren't. You keep asking yourself, √¢\x80\x9c What's wrong with me?√¢\x80\x9d Try not to think that way. √¢\x80\x9c So much of our misery grows out of the gap between where we are and where we think we ought to be,√¢\x80\x9d says Cook. So stop worrying about how you feel relative to other people. Stop assuming that you're supposed to be happy just because the calendar says it's June. Instead, concentrate on what's triggering your summer depression and how you can overcome it. √¢\x80\x9c Treatments do work,√¢\x80\x9d says Cook. √¢\x80\x9c Psychotherapy or medication can blunt the effects of a seasonal depression. Summers really don't have to be so bad.√¢\x80\x9d""]",How should I plan my summer vacation if I have summer depression?,"Summer depression, also known as [92m""summertime SAD"" [1][0m, is a form of seasonal affective disorder that [92m""affects about 4% to 6% of the U.

Isn't summer supposed to be fun and relaxing? If you've got summer depression, it isn't. For some people, summer depression has a biological cause, says Ian A. Cook, MD, the director of the Depression Research Program at UCLA. For others, the particular stresses of summer can pile up and make them feel miserable. Especially hard is that you feel like you're supposed to be having a great time. Everyone else seems so happy splashing in the water and sweating in their lawn chairs. So why can't you? And more importantly, what can you do to make this summer easier? Here's what you need to know about summer depression. Why do some people feel more depressed in summer? Here's a rundown of reasons. Summertime SAD. You've probably heard about seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, which affects about 4% to 6% of the U. S. population. SAD typically causes depression as the days get shorter and colder. But about 10% of people with SAD get it in the reverse -- the onset of summer triggers their depression symptoms. Cook notes that some studies have shown that in countries near the equator √¢\x80\x93 such as India √¢\x80\x93 summer SAD is more common than winter SAD. Why do seasonal changes cause depression? Experts aren't sure, but the longer days, and increasing heat and humidity may play a role. Specific symptoms of summer depression often include loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, weight loss, and anxiety. Disrupted schedules in summer. If you've had depression before, you probably know that having a reliable routine is often key to staving off symptoms. But during the summer, routine goes out the window √¢\x80\x93 and that disruption can be stressful, Cook says. If you have children in grade school, you're suddenly faced with the prospect of keeping them occupied all day, every day. If your kids are in college, you may suddenly find them √¢\x80\x93 and all their boxes of stuff √¢\x80\x93 back in the house after a nine-month absence. Vacations can disrupt your work, sleep, and eating habits √¢\x80\x93 all of which can all contribute to summer depression. Body image issues. As the temperature climbs and the layers of clothing fall away, a lot of people feel terribly self-conscious about their bodies, says Cook. Feeling embarrassed in shorts or a bathing suit can make life awkward, not to mention hot. Since so many summertime gatherings revolve around beaches and pools, some people start avoiding social situations out of embarrassment. Financial worries. Summers can be expensive. There's the vacation, of course. And if you're a working parent, you may have to fork over a lot of money to summer camps or babysitters to keep your kids occupied while you're on the job. The expenses can add to a feeling of summer depression. √¢\x80\x9c This summer, we have worries about the economic crisis layered on top of everything else,√¢\x80\x9d says Cook. √¢\x80\x9c People are feeling more financially strapped. They're wondering, √¢\x80\x98 If I go on vacation, will the job still be there when I get back? '√¢\x80\x9d The heat. Lots of people relish the sweltering heat. They love baking on a beach all day. But for the people who don't, summer heat can become truly oppressive. You may start spending every weekend hiding out in your air-conditioned bedroom, watching Pay- Per- View until your eyes ache. You may begin to skip your usual before-dinner walks because of the humidity. You may rely on unhealthy takeout because it's just too stifling to cook. Any of these things can contribute to summer depression. What can help you feel better? What can you do to make this summer different? Here are some tips on taking control of summer depression. Get help. It's simple. If you think you're getting depressed, no matter what time of year, get help. Talk to a therapist, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Or see your general medical doctor or a psychiatrist who can evaluate whether medicines for depression might be appropriate. Never take the signs of depression lightly. Don't wait them out, assuming they'll resolve. Sometimes, what started as summer depression can turn into a longer-lasting bout of major depression, Cook tells Web MD. And even if your depression will resolve in September, that's no reason to ignore it in June. We're talking about three months of potentially avoidable misery. √¢\x80\x9c A temporary depression can still be pretty awful,√¢\x80\x9d says Cook. While the symptoms lift in a few months, the impact on your family and job can be permanent. Plan ahead. Cook says there's one advantage to a summer depression: you know when it's coming. June is right there on the calendar. So if you're feeling OK in the spring, think about the specific aspects of your life that become difficult during the summer. What will help prevent summer depression? What's the best way to take time off from work? Would signing up the kids for summer programs or camp help relieve your stress? You'll feel a lot more in control heading into the summer if you have plans in place. Sleep. Vacations, summer barbecues, the short nights √¢\x80\x93 they can all encourage you to stay up later than usual. But not getting enough sleep is a common trigger for depression. So make a concerted effort to get to bed on time. Keep up with your exercise. Many studies have found that regular physical activity can help keep depression at bay. So even if it's getting too hot for your normal activities, find other ways to stay active and head off summer depression. Start earlier in the morning or later in the evening, when it's not so hot. Consider fitness equipment for the cool basement. If an annual membership to a gym is too expensive, consider joining one for a couple of months just to get you through the summer. Don't overdo dieting and fitness. Don't kick off the summer with a frenzy of dieting and exercise in order to fit into last year's bathing suit. It's bound to make you unhappy and anxious. Instead, exercise sensibly and eat moderately. If you try an insanely restrictive diet, you probably won't be able to keep it up. And that √¢\x80\x9cfailure√¢\x80\x9d will just leave you more demoralized and worsen your summer depression. Protect yourself. Don't let obligations drag you down. Maybe you always host the enormous family barbecue on Memorial Day or the July 4 picnic. But if you're feeling overwhelmed, give it a pass this year. Ask another relative to host. Don't risk pushing yourself into a summer depression just to live up to tradition. Think about why. If you struggle with summer depression year after year, ask yourself if there's a reason. Do you associate summer with a difficult time in the past √¢\x80\x93 the death of a loved one or the break-up of a relationship? Have you had previous bouts of depression during the summer? Without even realizing it, you may have started to associate the summer with sadness √¢\x80\x93 an association that gets stronger every summer that you spend depressed. If you do have some unhappy connection with the summer, sorting it out could help you break the cycle. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your medication. If you're on medicine for depression, and you find that summer √¢\x80\x93 year after year √¢\x80\x93 makes your depression worse, talk to your doctor about changing your dosage. Maybe he or she could up your dose in the late spring and taper it back down in the fall. It could really help head off summer depression problems, Cook says. Plan your vacation carefully. Before you book your plane tickets or load up your car's roof rack for your annual summer vacation, ask yourself this: Is this what you really want? Or is it an obligation you're fulfilling to a relative? Will it make you happy? Or will it stretch your finances, stress you out, and make you fall behind at work? Consider alternatives. Instead of taking a whole week off at once, might it be better to take off several long weekends spread out through the summer? Would taking time off but staying at home √¢\x80\x93 a √¢\x80\x9cstaycation√¢\x80\x9d √¢\x80\x93 be more relaxing? Don't get locked into a vacation that won't feel like a vacation. Don't beat yourself up. One thing that's hard about summer depression is that you feel so out of step. Everyone else seems to be having such a swell time. You aren't. You keep asking yourself, √¢\x80\x9c What's wrong with me?√¢\x80\x9d Try not to think that way. √¢\x80\x9c So much of our misery grows out of the gap between where we are and where we think we ought to be,√¢\x80\x9d says Cook. So stop worrying about how you feel relative to other people. Stop assuming that you're supposed to be happy just because the calendar says it's June. Instead, concentrate on what's triggering your summer depression and how you can overcome it. √¢\x80\x9c Treatments do work,√¢\x80\x9d says Cook. √¢\x80\x9c Psychotherapy or medication can blunt the effects of a seasonal depression. Summers really don't have to be so bad.√¢\x80\x9d""]",['https://www.webmd.com/depression/summer-depression'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/depression/summer-depression\nAh, the joys of summer: The withering heat and school vacations, when your kids give you minute-to-minute updates on their boredom levels.

When your heart doesn't pump right, the body starts to move blood from less vital parts like your arms and legs to the centers for survival -- the heart and brain. This can leave you feeling exhausted after everyday activities. An ongoing wheeze or cough that brings up white or slightly blood-colored mucus can signal fluid building up in your lungs. Call the doctor if you notice it. Fluid can build up in your tissues just like it does in your lungs. As a result, your feet, ankles, legs, or belly may swell. Your shoes and socks to feel tight. You might notice a sudden weight gain. \x1b[92m[1] Because blood is being moved away from your digestive system, your appetite may not be as big as it usually is\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] You might also feel sick to your stomach\x1b[0m. When your heart struggles to pump the right amount of blood, it may speed up to make up for it. This can lead to palpitations, which could cause your heart to race or feel like it's fluttering or throbbing. Unusual amounts of things like sodium in your blood can bring disorientation, confusion, or memory loss. If you've seen any of these seven red flags, get medical help right away. Waiting for symptoms to get worse can be dangerous. With the right care, you can keep things under control.""]",gKMqFz1xmDEbCM8,"[6.10795736312866,2.86291003227234]",2024-09-06 21:40:12.198823+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1}]","[True, True]",3,3

It affects an estimated 5.2 million school-age children in the U. S. Everyone, especially younger children, may have symptoms of ADHD from time to time. But with ADHD, the ability to function with daily activities is affected. A diagnosis of ADHD can be hard to make, and evaluation must be made by a specialist. There are several different approaches to treating ADHD. But research suggests that for many children, the best way to manage the symptoms is a multimodal approach. Multimodal treatment involves multiple methods of treatment that work together to help a child with ADHD. The main components of this approach are \x1b[92m[2] medications, behavioral therapy, and education\x1b[0m. The most commonly prescribed medications for ADHD are stimulants. These include: Amphetamine ( Adzenys XR- ODT) Amphetamine/ Dextroamphetamine ( Adderall, Adderall XR) Dexmethylphenidate ( Focalin, Focalin XR) Dextroamphetamine ( Dexedrine or Dextrostat) Lisdexamfetamine ( Vyvanse) Methylphenidate ( Concerta, Daytrana, Metadate, Methylin, Quillivant XR, Ritalin) Some of these drugs may be available in longer-acting formulations. Non-stimulant medications used to treat ADHD, include: Atomoxetine ( Strattera) Clonidine ER ( Kapvay) Guanfacine ER ( Intuniv) ADHD medications are used to improve children's ability to concentrate and work. \x1b[92m[3] Sometimes, a doctor must prescribe different medications or different dosages before finding the best treatment for a child\x1b[0m. Doctors and parents need to carefully monitor children taking medications for ADHD. Side effects of ADHD medicines can include: Anxiety Decreased appetite Fatigue Irritability Sleeping difficulties Skin discoloration (with patches) Upset stomach Most side effects are minor and improve with time. In some cases, doctors may lower a medication dosage to relieve side effects. The FDA recommends that a thorough medical history and exam, including an evaluation of underlying heart or psychiatric problems, be done as part of an ADHD treatment plan. A higher risk of strokes, heart attacks, and sudden death among patients with existing heart conditions has been linked to use of ADHD medications. An increased risk of psychiatric problems has also been linked to ADHD medications. The FDA has recently given approval to a device called Monach external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (e TNS) System to treat chilren age 7 to 12 years old. the cell phone-sized device delivers mild stimulation to electrodes which are attached to a patch worn on the oatient's forehead. Those electrical pulses interact with the part of the brain which is believed to be responsible for ADHD. Behavioral therapy is designed to help a child curb problematic behaviors. This may involve helping the child learn to organize time and activities. Or it could help a child complete homework. It may also involve helping the child control his or her impulses and responses to emotional stimuli. Educating parents about the disorder and its management is another important part of ADHD treatment. For parents, this may include learning parenting skills to help the child manage his or her behavior. That would involve skills such as giving positive feedback for desirable behaviors, ignoring undesirable behaviors, and giving time-outs when the child's behavior is out of control. In some cases, the child's entire family may be involved in this part of the treatment. Treatment guidelines call for behavior therapy as the preferred treatment for preschool children with ADHD. Medicine may be prescribed if further treatment is needed. For older children with ADHD, age 6 and older, an approach that includes both behavior therapy and medication is preferred. Researchers have found that multimodal treatment was particularly effective for improving social skills in children in highly stressful environments. It also was effective for those with anxiety and depression in addition to ADHD. Children who receive multimodal treatment may need lower doses of medications compared to children only receiving medication. A multimodal plan is effective for most children. The particular therapy and medication, however, will vary depending on the individual child.

Diabetes complications include: Heart disease Stroke Kidney disease Nerve damage Eye damage Digestion problems Erectile dysfunction Skin problems Infection Dental problems Heart disease is one of the most common diabetes complications. In office visits, your doctor may perform various tests to check for heart disease and help you prevent any serious heart-related problems. At every visit, your health care provider will check your blood pressure. Your cholesterol level and triglycerides may be checked at your first visit. A baseline EKG should also be obtained as part of a complete medical record. Learn more about personal risk factors you have for heart disease, such as a family history or whether you smoke, and work out a prevention plan that includes weight loss, regular exercise, and stress management, as well as keeping your blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides at normal levels. Signs and symptoms of stroke include \x1b[92m[1] sudden weakness on one side of the face or body; numbness in the face, arm, or leg; difficulty speaking; trouble seeing with both eyes; or dizziness\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] If you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor immediately\x1b[0m. You may be referred to a neurologist or other stroke specialist. Read more about the warning signs of stroke and also be aware of ways to prevent this serious problem from happening to you. If you have diabetes, urine testing should be performed yearly to look for diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease. A baseline creatinine blood test should also be done to determine your kidney function. Your health care provider will also check your blood pressure regularly, because control of high blood pressure is essential in slowing kidney disease. Blood pressure should be less than 130/80. Read about other symptoms of kidney disease in this health topic, such as persistent leg or feet swelling. Find out when to call your doctor to prevent serious problems. Over time, diabetes can cause nerve damage that produces symptoms of numbness, burning, or pain. If your skin becomes numb, you may not notice small wounds that could grow to become bigger health threats. Check your feet and hands daily for redness, calluses, cracks, or skin breakdown. If you notice any of these symptoms before your next scheduled visit, notify your health care provider immediately. To protect your vision, all people with diabetes should see an ophthalmologist (an eye doctor) at least yearly. As part of the eye exam the doctor will dilate your eyes so that he or she can see the back of the eye (retina) and determine if the diabetes is causing damage. In people with type 1 diabetes, these annual exams should start within three to five years of diabetes once the patient is age 10 or older. People with type 2 diabetes should have their first eye exam once they are diagnosed. Those with eye complications may need to see their ophthalmologist more frequently. Women with diabetes who become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye exam during the first trimester and close follow-up with an eye doctor during their pregnancy. ( This recommendation does not apply to women who develop gestational diabetes.) Diabetes increases your risk of gastroparesis. With gastroparesis, the nerves to the stomach are damaged and stop working properly. This causes the stomach to take too long to empty its contents and makes it difficult to manage blood glucose levels. Sometimes, changing your diet can help. There are some medications and treatments for gastroparesis. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent diabetes complications. Ask for information on early warning signs so you can seek treatment when it is most effective. Diabetes increases the chance of developing erectile dysfunction, or impotence. For some men, adopting a healthier lifestyle, such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and reducing stress, may be all that is needed to resolve erectile dysfunction. In this health topic, you'll also learn why it's important to talk to your health care provider about your erectile dysfunction, as your doctor can recommend other remedies -- including medications, a vacuum constriction device ( VCD), and other erectile dysfunction aids -- that can help. As many as a third of people with diabetes will have a skin condition related to their disease at some time in their lives. High levels of glucose in the blood provide an excellent breeding ground for bacteria and fungi and can reduce the body's ability to heal itself. Fortunately, most skin conditions can be prevented and successfully treated if caught early. If your skin is not cared for properly with type 2 diabetes, a minor skin condition can turn into a serious problem with potentially severe consequences. Type 2 diabetes slows down your body's ability to fight infection. High blood glucose leads to high levels of sugar in your body's tissues. When this happens, bacteria grow and infections can develop more quickly. Common sites of infection are your bladder, kidneys, vagina, gums, feet, and skin. Early treatment of infections can prevent more serious complications. People with diabetes face a higher than normal risk of serious dental and oral health problems. The more uncontrolled the blood sugar, the more likely dental and oral health problems will arise. This is because uncontrolled diabetes impairs white blood cells, which are the body's main defense against infections that can occur in the mouth.

Still, it's not always easy for doctors to diagnose your condition. The classic symptoms of EPI -- \x1b[92m[2] weight loss, greasy and foul-smelling stools that float or are tough to flush, stomach cramps, and diarrhea\x1b[0m -- mimic the telltale signs of many other digestive diseases. You might even have one of those diseases along with EPI, like Crohn's or celiac disease. That makes it hard for doctors to know exactly which condition is causing you trouble. To add to the confusion, not everyone with EPI has the same classic symptoms. Other warning signs can be too subtle for you to notice. To figure out what's going on, your doctor will use tests to see how many nutrients your body is absorbing from food. Here's a rundown of the tests she might use. Blood work. Your doctor will take a sample of your blood and send it to a lab to check it for anemia, a condition in which your body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells. The lab will also test your blood for vitamin B12, iron, and folate. If the levels are too low, that can mean EPI is keeping your body from absorbing these nutrients. The lab might also look for a chemical your pancreas makes to help with digestion called trypsinogen. A level that's too high is a sign of a problem. Fecal elastase test. You'll give your doctor a solid stool sample. The lab will check it for an enzyme your pancreas makes to help your body digest protein, called elastase. If you have EPI, the amount might be less concentrated than normal. 3-day fecal test. You'll need to collect samples of your stool in special containers for about 3 days and give them to your doctor. The lab will test them for the amount of fat they have. CT scan. This machine looks like a giant doughnut. It takes special X-rays that show your tissues and blood vessels, along with your bones. You'll lie on a padded table that slides you up so the machine is over your upper tummy. The doctor may take one set of images and then ask you to drink a kind of dye (they'll call it contrast) to get a better picture of the area. Tell your doctor if you've had a bad reaction to the dye in the past or if you're allergic to shellfish, like shrimp, crab, lobster, oysters, scallops, clams, or mussels. A basic scan takes about 10-15 minutes, but if you need contrast, you'll be there longer. Endoscopic ultrasound. Your doctor might need to take a closer look at your pancreas and other organs to see if they're damaged or inflamed. In a hospital, doctors will put a thin tube in your mouth, down through your stomach, and into the first part of your small intestine. At the tip is an ultrasound probe that gives off sound waves. They help make a picture of the inside of your body, which doctors can see on a screen. You might be asleep or awake for the test, but you'll get medicine to make you more comfortable. The test usually takes 20 to 45 minutes, and you won't need to stay in the hospital overnight. During this test, your doctor can also take a small piece of your tissue to study under a microscope -- if he needs one. MRI and MRCP. The MRI machine \x1b[92m[3] uses a magnet to take detailed pictures of your insides\x1b[0m. You'll lie on a padded table, and it will slide until your upper belly is under the magnet. You'll be awake for it, but if you get anxious in small, tight spaces, the doctor might give you a drug to help you relax. You won't have to stay overnight in the hospital. An MRCP is \x1b[92m[4] a special kind of MRI that focuses on your bile ducts and ducts in your pancreas\x1b[0m. The MRI takes about 35 minutes.

Nebulizers are particularly effective in delivering asthma medications to infants and small children and to anyone who has difficulty using an asthma inhaler. It is also convenient when a large dose of an inhaled medication is needed. Nebulized therapy is often called a ""breathing treatment."" And a variety of medications -- both for immediate relief and maintenance of asthma symptoms -- are available for use with a nebulizer. Nebulizers come in home (tabletop) and portable models. Home nebulizers are larger and must be plugged into an electrical outlet. Portable nebulizers run on batteries -- either disposable or rechargeable -- or can be plugged into a car\'s cigarette lighter. Smaller, portable units are slightly larger than a deck of cards, so they can be carried in a purse, briefcase, or backpack to be used whenever and wherever you need them. To obtain a nebulizer, you need a prescription from your doctor, or it can be dispensed from your pediatrician\'s office. ( Oftentimes, a breathing treatment is administered at the doctor\'s office.) Home nebulizers vary in cost, ranging from about $50 and up, plus the cost of accessories. Portable nebulizers usually cost a little more than home nebulizers. Both are usually covered under the durable medical equipment portion of health insurance policies. But, most insurance companies will require you to work with a specified durable medical equipment supplier. Check with your insurance company before purchasing or renting a nebulizer to ensure it will be covered. Your health care provider should be able to assist you with these arrangements. To use a nebulizer, you will need the following supplies: Air compressor Nebulizer cup Mask or mouthpiece Medication (either unit dose vials or bottles with measuring devices) Compressor tubing Once you have the necessary supplies: Place the air compressor on a sturdy surface that will support its weight. Plug the cord from the compressor into a properly grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet. Before asthma treatment, wash your hands with soap and water and dry completely. Carefully measure medications exactly as you have been instructed and put them into the nebulizer cup. Most medications today come in premeasured unit dose vials so measuring is not necessary. If you do measure, use a separate, clean measuring device for each medication. Assemble the nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece. Connect the tubing to both the aerosol compressor and nebulizer cup. Turn on the compressor to make sure it is working correctly. You should see a light mist coming from the back of the tube opposite the mouthpiece. Sit up straight on a comfortable chair. If the treatment is for your child, he or she may sit on your lap. If you are using a mask, position it comfortably and securely on your or your child\'s face. If you are using a mouthpiece, place it between your or your child\'s teeth and seal the lips around it. Take slow, deep breaths. If possible, hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before breathing out. This allows the medication to settle into the airways. Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (an average of 10 minutes). The nebulizer will make a sputtering noise, and the cup will have just a little medication remaining. If dizziness or jitteriness occurs, stop the treatment and rest for about 5 minutes. Continue the treatment, and try to breathe more slowly. If dizziness or jitteriness continues to be a problem with future treatments, inform your health care provider. During the treatment, if the medication sticks to the sides of the nebulizer cup, you may shake the cup to loosen the droplets. Your pediatrician should tell you the frequency of nebulizer use and how long you should use it. You should also be given an asthma action plan that explains which medications to use and when. Using a portable nebulizer is similar to using a home nebulizer, except that you don\'t need to plug it in. Most models are small enough to hold in your hand during use. Cleaning Cleaning and disinfecting your asthma nebulizer equipment is simple and very important. Proper care prevents infection. Cleaning should be done in a dust- and smoke-free area away from open windows. Follow these instructions when cleaning your nebulizer: \x1b[92m[1] After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess water, and let air dry\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] At the end of each day, the nebulizer cup, mask, or mouthpiece should be washed in warm soapy water using a mild detergent, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to air dry\x1b[0m. You do not need to clean the compressor tubing. \x1b[92m[3] Every third day, after washing your equipment, disinfect the equipment using either a vinegar/water solution or the disinfectant solution your equipment supplier suggests\x1b[0m. To use the vinegar solution, mix 1/2 cup white vinegar with 1 1/2 cups of water. Soak the equipment for 20 minutes and rinse well under a steady stream of water. Shake off the excess water and allow to air dry on a paper towel. \x1b[92m[4] Always allow the equipment to completely dry before storing in a plastic, zippered bag\x1b[0m. Storing \x1b[92m[5] Cover the compressor with a clean cloth when not in use\x1b[0m. Keep it clean by wiping it with a clean, damp cloth as needed. Do not put the air compressor on the floor either for treatments or for storage. \x1b[92m[6] Medications should be stored in a cool, dry place\x1b[0m. Some medications require refrigeration and some require protection from light. Check them often. If they have changed color or formed crystals, throw them away and replace them with new ones. Other Tips Always have an extra nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece in case you need it. If you are given a nebulizer treatment in the doctor\'s office, be sure to ask for the tubing, cup, and mask. Check the air compressor\'s filter as directed. Replace or clean according to the directions from your equipment supplier.']",How do you take care of a nebulizer?,"To take care of a nebulizer, [92m""After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess water, and let air dry"" [1][0m.

Nebulizers are particularly effective in delivering asthma medications to infants and small children and to anyone who has difficulty using an asthma inhaler. It is also convenient when a large dose of an inhaled medication is needed. Nebulized therapy is often called a ""breathing treatment."" And a variety of medications -- both for immediate relief and maintenance of asthma symptoms -- are available for use with a nebulizer. Nebulizers come in home (tabletop) and portable models. Home nebulizers are larger and must be plugged into an electrical outlet. Portable nebulizers run on batteries -- either disposable or rechargeable -- or can be plugged into a car\'s cigarette lighter. Smaller, portable units are slightly larger than a deck of cards, so they can be carried in a purse, briefcase, or backpack to be used whenever and wherever you need them. To obtain a nebulizer, you need a prescription from your doctor, or it can be dispensed from your pediatrician\'s office. ( Oftentimes, a breathing treatment is administered at the doctor\'s office.) Home nebulizers vary in cost, ranging from about $50 and up, plus the cost of accessories. Portable nebulizers usually cost a little more than home nebulizers. Both are usually covered under the durable medical equipment portion of health insurance policies. But, most insurance companies will require you to work with a specified durable medical equipment supplier. Check with your insurance company before purchasing or renting a nebulizer to ensure it will be covered. Your health care provider should be able to assist you with these arrangements. To use a nebulizer, you will need the following supplies: Air compressor Nebulizer cup Mask or mouthpiece Medication (either unit dose vials or bottles with measuring devices) Compressor tubing Once you have the necessary supplies: Place the air compressor on a sturdy surface that will support its weight. Plug the cord from the compressor into a properly grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet. Before asthma treatment, wash your hands with soap and water and dry completely. Carefully measure medications exactly as you have been instructed and put them into the nebulizer cup. Most medications today come in premeasured unit dose vials so measuring is not necessary. If you do measure, use a separate, clean measuring device for each medication. Assemble the nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece. Connect the tubing to both the aerosol compressor and nebulizer cup. Turn on the compressor to make sure it is working correctly. You should see a light mist coming from the back of the tube opposite the mouthpiece. Sit up straight on a comfortable chair. If the treatment is for your child, he or she may sit on your lap. If you are using a mask, position it comfortably and securely on your or your child\'s face. If you are using a mouthpiece, place it between your or your child\'s teeth and seal the lips around it. Take slow, deep breaths. If possible, hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before breathing out. This allows the medication to settle into the airways. Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (an average of 10 minutes). The nebulizer will make a sputtering noise, and the cup will have just a little medication remaining. If dizziness or jitteriness occurs, stop the treatment and rest for about 5 minutes. Continue the treatment, and try to breathe more slowly. If dizziness or jitteriness continues to be a problem with future treatments, inform your health care provider. During the treatment, if the medication sticks to the sides of the nebulizer cup, you may shake the cup to loosen the droplets. Your pediatrician should tell you the frequency of nebulizer use and how long you should use it. You should also be given an asthma action plan that explains which medications to use and when. Using a portable nebulizer is similar to using a home nebulizer, except that you don\'t need to plug it in. Most models are small enough to hold in your hand during use. Cleaning Cleaning and disinfecting your asthma nebulizer equipment is simple and very important. Proper care prevents infection. Cleaning should be done in a dust- and smoke-free area away from open windows. Follow these instructions when cleaning your nebulizer: \x1b[92m[1] After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess water, and let air dry\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] At the end of each day, the nebulizer cup, mask, or mouthpiece should be washed in warm soapy water using a mild detergent, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to air dry\x1b[0m. You do not need to clean the compressor tubing. \x1b[92m[3] Every third day, after washing your equipment, disinfect the equipment using either a vinegar/water solution or the disinfectant solution your equipment supplier suggests\x1b[0m. To use the vinegar solution, mix 1/2 cup white vinegar with 1 1/2 cups of water. Soak the equipment for 20 minutes and rinse well under a steady stream of water. Shake off the excess water and allow to air dry on a paper towel. \x1b[92m[4] Always allow the equipment to completely dry before storing in a plastic, zippered bag\x1b[0m. Storing \x1b[92m[5] Cover the compressor with a clean cloth when not in use\x1b[0m. Keep it clean by wiping it with a clean, damp cloth as needed. Do not put the air compressor on the floor either for treatments or for storage. \x1b[92m[6] Medications should be stored in a cool, dry place\x1b[0m. Some medications require refrigeration and some require protection from light. Check them often. If they have changed color or formed crystals, throw them away and replace them with new ones. Other Tips Always have an extra nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece in case you need it. If you are given a nebulizer treatment in the doctor\'s office, be sure to ask for the tubing, cup, and mask.

A synthesized form of SAM-e is considered a supplement in the U. S., but SAM-e has been sold as a prescription drug in parts of Europe for decades. Its scientific name is S-adenosylmethionine. SAM-e is also known as ademetionine and SAMe. SAM-e has good evidence as a treatment for osteoarthritis pain. Some studies have found that oral SAM-e is as effective as NSAID painkillers, such as ibuprofen and Celebrex. SAM-e takes longer to act than drugs do, but it also has fewer side effects than NSAIDs. SAM-e has also been used to treat depression for many years. Some studies have found that SAM-e might work as well as tricyclic antidepressants in relieving symptoms. However, many of these studies were flawed or too small to be conclusive. Other uses of SAM-e have not been studied as thoroughly. There's some evidence that SAM-e might help ease the pain of fibromyalgia and spinal cord damage caused by HIV. SAM-e may also help control cholestasis -- a buildup of bile in the liver -- particularly in pregnant women during the third trimester. One trial suggested that SAM-e might be helpful for adults with ADHD. However, more research needs to be done. Some people use SAM-e as a treatment for other conditions, such as liver disease, Alzheimer's disease, pain, migraine, and bursitis.

32,169,"[""https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/stage-1-treatment-options\nIn this early stage, the cancer either hasn't spread beyond the breast or has spread in a very small amount to a lymph node. You have a number of treatments to choose from. Women usually do well with a combination of treatments. Surgery is standard treatment for this stage. Since the tumor is small, you may have a lumpectomy -- just the tumor and some of the tissue around it are removed. Some women get a mastectomy, in which the whole breast is removed. In either case, the surgeon will likely take out one or more lymph nodes. After a mastectomy, you might choose to have breast reconstruction surgery. Radiation therapy can kill cancer cells that were missed. It's usually given after a lumpectomy. Women with stage I cancer who get a mastectomy sometimes need radiation, too. Chemotherapy after surgery can lower the risk of the cancer coming back. The drugs attack cancer cells. Women who had larger tumors removed are more likely to get chemo. You can get chemo several ways. You may take pills or liquids, but often the drugs are put right into your veins. The treatment is usually given in cycles that allow your body breaks in between. Hormone therapy is a good option after surgery for women who have tumors that use hormones to grow, called hormone receptor-positive cancer. Medication can help prevent tumors from getting hormones. These drugs include tamoxifen for all women, and anastrozole ( Arimidex), exemestane ( Aromasin), and letrozole ( Femara) for postmenopausal women. Women who haven't reached menopause may consider having their ovaries removed to stop making hormones that help cancer grow. Targeted therapy is a newer treatment. About 20% of women with breast cancer have too much of a protein known as HER2 that sometimes makes the cancer spread quickly. Trastuzumab ( Herceptin) is a drug that's been approved to treat women with HER2-positive cancer. It stops this protein from making the cancer grow and makes some chemotherapy more effective. \x1b[92m[1] Clinical trials are something else to consider\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] They're open to many women with stage I cancer, and they may allow you access to cutting-edge treatments\x1b[0m.

Spider veins are easily visible through the skin, as well. They are typically visible on the legs and face. A number of factors predispose a person to varicose veins and spider veins.

Varicose veins and spider veins develop more often in women than in men. They increase in frequency with age. An estimated 30% to 60% of adults have varicose veins or spider veins. Many people with varicose veins complain of pain, described as an aching or cramping in the legs. Other common symptoms include tiredness, restlessness, burning, throbbing, tingling, or heaviness in the legs. Pain from these veins is usually relieved by elevating the legs or by wearing support hose. In women, symptoms may be worse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy. Less common is swelling, ulcers and a darkening of the skin, especially in the ankle region. Occasionally, varicose veins can form a painful blood clot with inflammation of the vein, a condition called thrombophlebitis. There are seven major forms of treatment for varicose veins and spider veins: 1. Support stockings. The most conservative approach is simply to wear properly-fitting support hose, especially when the veins cause painful or uncomfortable symptoms. These stockings can generally be purchased at any surgical supply store and at some pharmacies. They come in below-the-knee, above-the-knee, and pantyhose styles. 2. Lifestyle changes. Good skin hygiene, weight loss (if needed), and walking can help treat varicose veins and spider veins. 3. Sclerotherapy. This procedure, which has been available since the 1930s, is another treatment option. This procedure uses a highly concentrated saline (salt) solution or a specially made detergent that is injected directly into the vein, causing the vein to disappear gradually over three to six weeks. The procedure is simple, relatively inexpensive, and can be performed in an outpatient setting. 4. Endovenous laser treatment is a procedure in which a small laser fiber is inserted into the vein. Pulses of laser light are delivered inside the vein, which causes the vein to collapse. The procedure is done as an outpatient under local anesthesia. 5. Radiofrequency occlusion. A small catheter is inserted into the vein. The catheter delivers radiofrequency energy to the vein wall, causing it to heat, collapse, and seal shut. The procedure is generally done in an outpatient or office setting, sometimes under local anesthesia. 6. Surgery. Surgical techniques to treat varicose veins include ligation (tying off of a vein) and stripping (removal of a long segment of vein). Another procedure, ambulatory phlebectomy, allows for the removal of large surface veins through very small incisions that do not need stitches. Surgery may be performed using local, spinal, or general anesthesia. Most patients return home the same day as the procedure. Surgery is generally used to treat large varicose veins. 7. Lasers and intense pulsed light. Surface laser or intense pulsed light treatments, such as Vasculight and Photo Derm, are other options. These devices use heat energy to selectively damage or destroy abnormal veins. An advantage of these treatments is that no needles or sclerosing solutions are required; however, there may be some minor discomfort. Side effects do occur, including discoloration or staining and blister formation. The results are often disappointing. Not everybody with varicose or spider veins has pain or other symptoms. They might want the veins removed, however, for cosmetic reasons. Many insurance companies cover the cost of treating varicose veins, but generally not spider veins.

34,132,"[""https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/understanding-skin-cancer-treatment\nAll potentially cancerous skin growths must be biopsied to confirm a cancer diagnosis. Depending on the suspected type of skin cancer, the biopsy techniques vary slightly but crucially. Any potential melanoma requires a surgical biopsy, in which the entire growth is removed with a scalpel if possible. A pathologist then studies the sample under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present. Ifmelanomais diagnosed, other tests may be ordered to assess the degree of cancer spread (metastasis). They include: Imaging. Your doctor will order one or more tests to look for metastasis. They include CT scan, MRI, PET scan, bone scan, and chest X-ray. Other biopsies. Using a variety of techniques, your doctor may want to get tissue samples from lymph nodes. Skin growths that are most likely basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or other forms of non-melanoma can be biopsied in various ways. Part or all of the growth can be taken with a scalpel for examination under a microscope. Most skin cancers are detected and cured before they spread. Melanoma that has spread to other organs presents the greatest treatment challenge. Standard treatments for localized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are safe and effective and cause few side effects. Small tumors can be surgically excised, removed with skin scraping and electric current cauterization, frozen with liquid nitrogen, or killed with low-dose radiation. In rare cases where basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma has begun to spread beyond the local skin site, the primary tumors are first removed surgically. Then patients may be treated with radiation, immunotherapy in the form of interferon, and rarely, chemotherapy. However, responses to this therapy are infrequent and short-lived. Rare patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma respond well to a combination of retinoic acid (a derivative of vitamin A) and interferon (a type of disease-fighting protein produced in labs for cancer immunotherapy). Retinoic acid may inhibit cancer recurrence in patients who have had tumors removed, but there is a lack of evidence to support either of these treatments. Vismodegib ( Erivedge) may be used to treat the rare cases of locally advanced, or metastatic, basal cell carcinoma and has been shown to shrink these tumors. Sonidegib ( Odomzo) can be used to treat patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma who are not candidates for surgery or radiation. It may also be used if the skin cancer returns after surgery or radiation. Melanoma tumors must be removed surgically, preferably before they spread beyond the skin into other organs. The surgeon removes the tumor fully, along with a safe margin of surrounding tissue and possibly nearby lymph nodes. Neither radiation nor chemotherapy will cure advanced melanoma, but either treatment may slow the disease and relieve symptoms. Chemotherapy, sometimes in combination with immunotherapy -- such as interferon, interleukin-2 -- is generally preferred. If melanoma spreads to the brain, radiation is used to slow the growth and control symptoms. Proton therapy may be used, as well. Immunotherapy is a field of cancer treatment that attempts to target and kill cancer cells by manipulating the body's immune system. Some of the most promising developments in the field of immunotherapy have arisen from efforts to cure advanced melanoma. Some researchers are treating advanced cases with vaccines, while others are using drugs such as interferon, interleukin-2, and ipilimumab ( Yervoy) in an effort to stimulate immune cells into attacking melanoma cells more aggressively. In patients with advanced melanoma, two drugs, nivolumab ( Opdivo) and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) have been found to be effective after use of ipilimumab. These drugs help block proteins on T cells that normally help keep them in check, therefore allowing these immune cells to attack melanoma cells. Genetic manipulation of melanoma tumors may make them more vulnerable to attack by the immune system. Each of these treatment approaches aims to immunize a patient's body against its own cancer -- something the body cannot do naturally. There are other drugs that target specific genes within normal cells that cause them to become cancerous. Called targeted therapy, these drugs include dabrafenib ( Tafinlar), trametinib ( Mekinist) and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf). \x1b[92m[1] People who have had skin cancer once are at risk for getting it again\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Anyone who has been treated for skin cancer of any kind should have a checkup at least twice a year\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] About 20% of skin cancer patients experience recurrence or a second separate tumor, often within the first two years after diagnosis\x1b[0m. Once skin cancer is diagnosed, the only acceptable treatment is medical care. Alternative approaches may be useful in cancer prevention and in combating nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and headaches from chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy used to treat advanced skin cancer. Be sure to discuss any alternative treatments you are considering using with your cancer doctor. Skin experts know that the mineral zinc and the antioxidant vitamins A (beta-carotene), C, and E can help repair damaged body tissue and promote healthy skin. Now, researchers are trying to determine whether these and other nutrients might protect skin from the harmful effects of sunlight. To test the theory, selected skin cancer patients are given experimental supplements of these vitamins in the hope of preventing cancer recurrence. Thus far, no nutrient has been found to be protective against skin cancer.""]",Can you get skin cancer again?,"[92m""People who have had skin cancer once are at risk for getting it again"" [1][0m. [92m""Anyone who has been treated for skin cancer of any kind should have a checkup at least twice a year"" [2][0m. [92m""About 20% of skin cancer patients experience recurrence or a second separate tumor, often within the first two years after diagnosis"" [3][0m.","""People who have had skin cancer once are at risk for getting it again.""

Ifmelanomais diagnosed, other tests may be ordered to assess the degree of cancer spread (metastasis). They include: Imaging. Your doctor will order one or more tests to look for metastasis. They include CT scan, MRI, PET scan, bone scan, and chest X-ray. Other biopsies. Using a variety of techniques, your doctor may want to get tissue samples from lymph nodes. Skin growths that are most likely basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or other forms of non-melanoma can be biopsied in various ways. Part or all of the growth can be taken with a scalpel for examination under a microscope. Most skin cancers are detected and cured before they spread. Melanoma that has spread to other organs presents the greatest treatment challenge. Standard treatments for localized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are safe and effective and cause few side effects. Small tumors can be surgically excised, removed with skin scraping and electric current cauterization, frozen with liquid nitrogen, or killed with low-dose radiation. In rare cases where basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma has begun to spread beyond the local skin site, the primary tumors are first removed surgically. Then patients may be treated with radiation, immunotherapy in the form of interferon, and rarely, chemotherapy. However, responses to this therapy are infrequent and short-lived. Rare patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma respond well to a combination of retinoic acid (a derivative of vitamin A) and interferon (a type of disease-fighting protein produced in labs for cancer immunotherapy). Retinoic acid may inhibit cancer recurrence in patients who have had tumors removed, but there is a lack of evidence to support either of these treatments. Vismodegib ( Erivedge) may be used to treat the rare cases of locally advanced, or metastatic, basal cell carcinoma and has been shown to shrink these tumors. Sonidegib ( Odomzo) can be used to treat patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma who are not candidates for surgery or radiation. It may also be used if the skin cancer returns after surgery or radiation. Melanoma tumors must be removed surgically, preferably before they spread beyond the skin into other organs. The surgeon removes the tumor fully, along with a safe margin of surrounding tissue and possibly nearby lymph nodes. Neither radiation nor chemotherapy will cure advanced melanoma, but either treatment may slow the disease and relieve symptoms. Chemotherapy, sometimes in combination with immunotherapy -- such as interferon, interleukin-2 -- is generally preferred. If melanoma spreads to the brain, radiation is used to slow the growth and control symptoms. Proton therapy may be used, as well. Immunotherapy is a field of cancer treatment that attempts to target and kill cancer cells by manipulating the body's immune system. Some of the most promising developments in the field of immunotherapy have arisen from efforts to cure advanced melanoma. Some researchers are treating advanced cases with vaccines, while others are using drugs such as interferon, interleukin-2, and ipilimumab ( Yervoy) in an effort to stimulate immune cells into attacking melanoma cells more aggressively. In patients with advanced melanoma, two drugs, nivolumab ( Opdivo) and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) have been found to be effective after use of ipilimumab. These drugs help block proteins on T cells that normally help keep them in check, therefore allowing these immune cells to attack melanoma cells. Genetic manipulation of melanoma tumors may make them more vulnerable to attack by the immune system. Each of these treatment approaches aims to immunize a patient's body against its own cancer -- something the body cannot do naturally. There are other drugs that target specific genes within normal cells that cause them to become cancerous. Called targeted therapy, these drugs include dabrafenib ( Tafinlar), trametinib ( Mekinist) and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf). People who have had skin cancer once are at risk for getting it again. Anyone who has been treated for skin cancer of any kind should have a checkup at least twice a year. About 20% of skin cancer patients experience recurrence or a second separate tumor, often within the first two years after diagnosis. Once skin cancer is diagnosed, the only acceptable treatment is medical care. Alternative approaches may be useful in cancer prevention and in combating nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and headaches from chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy used to treat advanced skin cancer. Be sure to discuss any alternative treatments you are considering using with your cancer doctor. Skin experts know that the mineral zinc and the antioxidant vitamins A (beta-carotene), C, and E can help repair damaged body tissue and promote healthy skin. Now, researchers are trying to determine whether these and other nutrients might protect skin from the harmful effects of sunlight. To test the theory, selected skin cancer patients are given experimental supplements of these vitamins in the hope of preventing cancer recurrence. Thus far, no nutrient has been found to be protective against skin cancer.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/understanding-skin-cancer-treatment'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/understanding-skin-cancer-treatment\nAll potentially cancerous skin growths must be biopsied to confirm a cancer diagnosis.

An allergy is the immune system\'s reaction when exposed to what is otherwise a harmless substance, such as plant pollen, mold, or animal hair, skin or saliva. The immune system acts as a body defense, yet for people with allergies, the immune system treats these substances, called ""allergens,"" as if they are harmful, causing a disruption to normal body functions. Allergens are what trigger a series of reactions by the immune system during an allergic reaction. Inhaled Allergens. The most important allergens for people with allergic asthma appear to be those asthma triggers that are inhaled. Hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs when a person comes in contact with an allergen or a substance that he or she is sensitive to. Common inhaled allergens include: Animal dander (skin, saliva) Dust mites Cockroach particles Mold Pollen Medical experts recommend that all people with allergies and asthma try to identify possible inhaled allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms. Food Allergies. Food allergies rarely cause asthma yet they can cause a severe life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. The condition can lead to symptoms that include difficulty breathing, wheezing, an itchy rash, low blood pressure, and vomiting. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow\'s milk Peanuts Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, walnuts) Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Food preservatives can also trigger allergic and asthmatic reactions. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and may be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods If you suspect that certain foods may be the cause of your asthma, discuss this with your doctor. Allergy skin testing can be done to determine if you are allergic to these foods. \x1b[92m[1] If you have allergies and asthma, avoid the substance you are allergic to\x1b[0m. Here are some tips to help you avoid some of the most common allergens and prevent asthma attack symptoms. Dust Mites Encase pillows, mattresses, and box springs with allergen-proof, zippered covers. Wash all bedding in hot water once a week. Non-carpeted flooring is best. If you cannot get rid of your carpeting, vacuum often with an HEPA filter. Wear a mask while vacuuming. If your child has asthma, do not vacuum while he or she is in the room. Products that eliminate dust mites from carpeting (such as Acarosan) can be purchased. Your asthma care provider can give you information about these products. Avoid curtains and drapes. Use plain window shades instead of mini-blinds. Washable curtains should be washed in hot water every two to four weeks. Dust all surfaces with a damp cloth often, including lampshades and windowsills. Keep clutter under control. Toys and books should be stored in enclosed bookshelves, drawers or closets. Replace traditional stuffed animals with washable stuffed animals. Keep all clothing in drawers and closets. Keep drawers and closets closed. Cover air ducts with filters. Change these when soiled. Pillows and bedding should not contain feathers. Keep indoor humidity low (below 50%). Use a dehumidifier if needed. Regularly change filters on heaters and air conditioners. Mold and Mildew Air out damp, humid areas frequently. Run a dehumidifier to keep humidity between 35% and 45%. Use air conditioners when possible. Clean bathrooms regularly using products that kill and prevent mold. Use exhaust fans to vent steam. Do not carpet the bathroom. Keep indoor plants out of bedrooms. When painting, add mold inhibitor to paint to prevent mold from growing. Avoid sources of outdoor molds, such as wet leaves or garden debris. To clean visible mold use a cleaning solution containing bleach ( one ounce per quart of water). Insects Many homes and apartments have cockroaches and other insects. Some people with asthma are allergic to a protein in their droppings. To control these allergens in your home: Use roach baits or traps. Insect sprays can be used, but should only be sprayed when no one is at home. Before you or your child returns home after spraying, make sure that your home has been aired out for a couple of hours. Because cockroaches thrive in high humid environment, fix water leaks in and around your home. Cover food in lidded or sealed containers. Clean dishes after eating. Sweep floors after you have eaten. Pollen Pollen is a tiny egg shaped cell from flowering plants. Pollens are difficult to avoid because they cannot be eliminated from the atmosphere. Plants have different periods of pollination, which varies little from year to year. Yet, the type of weather affects the amount of pollen in the air with hot, dry, and windy weather causing more pollen in the air. In general pollen season starts from February to October. You can lessen your or your child\'s exposure to pollen by: Limiting your or your child\'s outdoor activities during times of high pollen, such as early morning. Having him wear a hat outdoors, washing his hands and face when he comes inside, and having him change his clothes after being outside. Staying indoors during dry or windy days when pollen counts are high. Keeping windows closed during pollen seasons. Using air conditioning if possible. Pet Dander It is best not to own any pets if you or your child is highly allergic to pet dander. Long visits to friends and family who own pets should be avoided. If you do visit, make sure you or your child takes asthma or allergy medicines before the visit. Exposure to the pets should be kept to a minimum when visiting. If you must have a cat or dog in the home, restrict its living area. It should not be allowed in your or your child\'s bedroom at any time. If possible, keep the pet outside. Wash your pet weekly. Remove as much carpeting as possible. Animal dander deposits in the carpet and stays there, even after the pet is gone from the home.

Hospital medication errors are especially scary. How would you even know if a nurse is giving you the wrong drug or the wrong dosage? But experts say that you can help prevent such mistakes.

37,200,"[""https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/common-denture-problems\nDentures can be an important solution to tooth loss. Today's dentures, also called false teeth, are not like the ones your grandmother wore. They are more comfortable and natural looking than they were in the past. Still, if you don't take proper care of your dentures, problems can occur. Web MD takes a look at common denture problems and how they can be treated or prevented. If you wear dentures, it is very important you keep your mouth clean and healthy. You should also only wear dentures that fit properly. Otherwise, the following problems may occur: Gum and mouth irritation Problems eating and speaking Dentures that move around in your mouth Mouth infections \x1b[92m[1] If you have problems with your dentures, see your dentist right away\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Your dentures may need to be adjusted or replaced\x1b[0m. Here are some ways to treat various denture problems: Make sure your dentures fit. Over time, your gums and bones will change and your dentures won't fit as well. When this happens, your dentures need to be adjusted, modified, or replaced by your dentist. Never try to adjust your dentures yourself. Speak slowly. When you first get dentures, it may be hard for you to say certain words. Be patient. Practice saying the challenging words aloud and speak slowly. If your dentures move around when you laugh or smile, gently bite down and swallow to put them back in place. Check with your dentist to adjust the fit. Eat soft foods. If you are having trouble eating, follow these tips: Take small bites of soft foods, such as eggs and yogurt. Don't eat anything sticky. Chew your food slowly. When you chew, use both sides of your mouth at the same time. This prevents your dentures from moving forward or tipping. Eating will become easier as you get used to your dentures. In time, you should be able to eat most foods. Use an adhesive. Denture adhesives help your dentures stay in place and make them feel more secure. But denture adhesives should not be used to fix old or poorly fitting dentures - and should generally be avoided. When using an adhesive, follow the instructions carefully. Use only a small amount. Some people who wear dentures get mouth infections, such as: Cheilitis. This is a painful infection that causes inflammation and cracking at the corners of your mouth. It is caused by an overgrowth of yeast. Yeast can accumulate in moist areas of your mouth if your dentures don't fit properly. To prevent cheilitis (also called cheilosis), see your dentist regularly to make sure your dentures fit properly. Also, try not to rub or lick the corners of your mouth. Stomatitis . This is another infection that is caused by too much yeast. You may not know you have denture-induced stomatitis, because symptoms are not always obvious. When symptoms are noticeable, you may see small red bumps on the roof of your mouth or general mouth redness, especially under your upper dentures. Both cheilitis and stomatitis can be treated with medicine and proper denture care. Along with making sure they fit well, it is important to take good care of your dentures. Here are some tips to keep your dentures working and looking their best: Never sleep with your dentures. Unless your dentist advises you to do so for a specific time, such as after multiple extractions and initial delivery of new dentures, do not sleep with your dentures. Handle dentures with care. Your dentures are delicate and can break easily. When holding your dentures, stand over a sink filled with water or place a towel on the counter. That way your dentures will be protected in case you accidentally drop them. Also, keep your dentures safely out of reach of children and pets. Clean your dentures daily. Here are some tips for cleaning your dentures: Soak your dentures overnight in a denture cleaner. Thoroughly clean them each morning before putting them in your mouth. Use a soft-bristled brush or special denture-cleaning brush. You can use plain soap and warm water or ask your dentist to recommend a denture cleaner. Never use powdered household cleaners or bleach on your dentures, nor toothpaste, which is too abrasive. Clean your mouth daily. Clean and massage your gums, tongue, and roof of your mouth each day before putting in your dentures. This will help keep your mouth healthy. Store your dentures properly. When your dentures are not in your mouth, store them in a denture-cleaning solution or warm water. Do not use hot water. Hot water may cause your dentures to lose their shape. Don't use toothpicks. Toothpicks can damage your dentures. Wearing dentures can be difficult at first. It may take time to get used to them. But you can prevent denture problems by taking good care of your dentures and seeing your dentist every six months for regular checkups.

38,213,"[""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/cancer-avoid-germs\nCancer and cancer treatments can weaken your immune system and make it hard for it to protect your body against germs. Chemotherapy, for example, can lower the number of white blood cells you have. Because their job is to stop infections, it makes it tougher for your body to fight germs. Some things that can make it easier for you to get an infection include: Chemotherapy Radiation Stress Lack of sleep Poor nutrition Cancer that affects the blood or lymph nodes, such as leukemia or lymphoma Cancer that has spread to other parts of the body But you can do a few things to protect yourself. \x1b[92m[1] Wash your hands\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Do it often, and use soap and water\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Wash them before you eat and before you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Always clean up after you go to the bathroom, sneeze, cough, or blow your nose\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Other times to wash: after you handle trash, go to a public place, or touch an animal\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you in case you can't get to soap and water when you're out and about\x1b[0m. Eat a well-balanced diet. Ask your doctor if you can eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Some doctors say it's OK as long as you wash the produce very well. Others say it's safer to just skip them. Stay away from raw meats, shellfish, and eggs. It may also be smart to avoid foods that have been linked to infection outbreaks in the past, like raw sprouts, berries, and fresh salsa. Don't eat deli foods, free food samples, or yogurt and ice cream products from soft-serve machines. Skip foods bought from self-serve or bulk bins. Don't buy dented cans or pre-cut fruits and veggies. Be careful around people. If you know that someone has a fever, cold, flu, or any other infection, stay away from them until they feel better. It's also best to skip large groups of people, so avoid shopping, schools, traveling, and crowds. If you do go out in public, use cleaning wipes before you touch door handles, elevator buttons, ATM keypads, or any other surface used by a lot of people. Take care of your body. Take a shower or bath every day. Pay special attention to your feet, armpits, and other sweaty areas. When you're done, use lotion so your skin doesn't get dry and crack. Consider using an electric shaver instead of a razor so you don't cut yourself. Brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Ask if it's OK to floss gently. Don't use alcohol-based mouthwashes -- your doctor or dentist may give you a special mouthwash. Use gloves. Be careful when you garden or do housework. Wear gloves so you don't hurt your hands or pick up germs from the soil. Use caution when you handle sharp things like scissors, knives, or gardening tools. Don't share. Don't use the same glasses, utensils, or food as others. Don't share towels, toothbrushes, or makeup, either. Watch what you touch. Try not to change diapers. If you do, wash your hands as soon as possible when you're done. Don't clean up after your pet in the yard, and don't touch dirt that could have animal droppings in it. Let someone else change the litter boxes, clean the birdcage, or clean the fish or turtle tanks.""]","When I√¢¬Ä¬ôm being treated for cancer, how often should I wash my hands?","[92m""Wash your hands"" [1][0m. [92m""Do it often, and use soap and water"" [2][0m. [92m""Wash them before you eat and before you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth"" [3][0m. [92m""Always clean up after you go to the bathroom, sneeze, cough, or blow your nose"" [4][0m. [92m""Other times to wash: after you handle trash, go to a public place, or touch an animal"" [5][0m. [92m""Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you in case you can't get to soap and water when you're out and about"" [6][0m.","""Wash your hands.

39,174,"[""https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/when-call-newborns-doctor\nWouldn't it be great if your newborn came home from the hospital with a set of instructions and rules that spelled out exactly when you need to call the pediatrician? But she doesn't. And your little one can't tell you what's wrong. So it's important to know the signs of serious problems. Trouble breathing. If your baby is breathing more than 60 breaths a minute, having pauses in breathing, or has a bluish tint to her skin, lips, and nails, it could be a lung or heart condition. Fever. If the baby's temperature measured in the rectum is 100.4 F or higher, she has a fever. For the first 3 months of your baby's life, take temperatures in the rectum, not in the ear, mouth, or under the armpit. Fever in newborns may be due to a serious condition such as bacterial meningitis or sepsis, a bloodstream infection. Both can be life-threatening if they aren't treated right away. Before you call, write down your child's temperature and the exact time you took it. Blood in vomit or stool. It may just be due to diaper rash, but it could also be a sign of a more serious stomach condition. Yellowish skin or eyes. This can be a sign of jaundice, which usually develops between the second and fourth day after birth. You can check by pressing gently on your infant's forehead -- if the skin looks yellow, she may have mild jaundice. Most hospitals check your newborn for jaundice before she goes home, but it can develop in breastfed babies anytime during the first week of life. Your pediatrician will check for it during the first office visit, 1-3 days after the baby leaves the hospital. Your baby is sleeping more than usual or won't wake up. It's true that most newborns can sleep pretty much through anything. But if your baby won't stir even after you've undressed her or prodded her a bit, it's time to call the doctor. Not eating. If your newborn refuses several feedings in a row or seems to be eating less than usual, check with your doctor. Not peeing. A healthy newborn has 6 to 8 wet diapers in 24 hours after day 4 of life. If she has fewer than that, she may be dehydrated. Other signs include sunken eyes and a sunken fontanel (the soft spot on your baby's head), and no tears when crying. Diarrhea. This can be hard to notice in a newborn, especially a breastfeeding one, as she has frequent, soft stools. If you suddenly notice more frequent bowel movements (for example, several while eating) or very watery ones, it could be diarrhea. Call your pediatrician if it goes on for 6-8 diaper changes. Constipation. Your newborn should have a bowel movement at least once a day during the first month. If she doesn't, call your doctor, as the baby may not be eating enough. After that, a formula-fed infant should have one at least one a day, but breastfed infants can go several days or even a week without one. If your baby is 1 month or older and is constipated (no pooping, or hard stool), you can try giving apple or pear juice (1 ounce a day for every month of life, so a 2-month-old would get 2 ounces). If that doesn't help after a day or two, call your pediatrician. A cold that doesn't get better. Even newborns come down with colds. Most of the time, the congestion and runny nose is uncomfortable for your little one but isn't serious. But call the doctor if your baby is so stuffed up she has trouble feeding or sleeping, if she seems especially cranky, or if nasal symptoms last longer than 10-14 days. Vomiting. It's normal for your newborn to \x1b[92m[1] spit up small amounts of milk within an hour after being fed\x1b[0m. But if \x1b[92m[2] the flow is particularly forceful and happens more than two or three times in a day, call your doctor\x1b[0m. It could indicate \x1b[92m[3] an infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or, in rare cases, pyloric stenosis, a thickening of stomach muscles that requires surgery\x1b[0m. Tender belly button or penis. If your baby's umbilical area or penis (for circumcised boys) becomes red or starts to ooze or bleed, it could be a sign of a bacterial infection, and it needs antibiotic treatment right away. Diaper rash that doesn't go away. More than half of all babies get redness around their diaper area. You can treat it with a thick layer of zinc oxide or petroleum, but if it doesn't get better within 48 to 72 hours, bleeds, or you see pus-filled sores, call your doctor. Your baby may have a yeast or bacterial infection and will need medication. If you're worried, pick up the phone. It's always best to err on the side of caution, especially when it comes to newborns. Pediatricians' offices are used to fielding calls from anxious parents and can always help ease your worries or tell you what to do.

This happens when the fluid that lubricates your knee joint increases. When pressure builds up, fluid squeezes into the back of the knee and creates the cyst. Arthritis. People with all forms of arthritis often have Baker's cysts. Injury. A sports-related injury or other blow to the knee can cause A Baker's cyst. Gout . This a type of arthritis, which results from the buildup of uric acid in the blood, can lead to a Baker's cyst. See your doctor if you have any of the symptoms listed above and they're causing problems. They'll examine you to rule out conditions that are more serious, like a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis). He may also order an imaging test, like an ultrasound or MRI, to get a better look. You may not need any treatment for a Baker's cyst. They aren't dangerous and tend to go away on their own. In the meantime, try these at-home remedies to ease your pain and make yourself more comfortable: Keep it cold. Apply a cold pack to the affected area. It'll help keep the swelling down. A compression wrap might also help. Relieve pain. For pain (and to reduce inflammation), take an over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen. Rest your leg. Keep it raised above your heart level when possible. This will keep down swelling. Use a cane or crutch when you walk to keep pressure off your leg.

This happens when the fluid that lubricates your knee joint increases. When pressure builds up, fluid squeezes into the back of the knee and creates the cyst. Arthritis. People with all forms of arthritis often have Baker's cysts. Injury. A sports-related injury or other blow to the knee can cause A Baker's cyst. Gout . This a type of arthritis, which results from the buildup of uric acid in the blood, can lead to a Baker's cyst. See your doctor if you have any of the symptoms listed above and they're causing problems. They'll examine you to rule out conditions that are more serious, like a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis). He may also order an imaging test, like an ultrasound or MRI, to get a better look. You may not need any treatment for a Baker's cyst. They aren't dangerous and tend to go away on their own. In the meantime, try these at-home remedies to ease your pain and make yourself more comfortable: Keep it cold. Apply a cold pack to the affected area. It'll help keep the swelling down. A compression wrap might also help. Relieve pain. For pain (and to reduce inflammation), take an over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen. Rest your leg. Keep it raised above your heart level when possible. This will keep down swelling. Use a cane or crutch when you walk to keep pressure off your leg. If these at-home treatments don't work, see your doctor. They may recommend one of the following: Steroids . These can help reduce inflammation. Aspiration. Your doctor can drain the cyst. They'll likely do it with the aid of an ultrasound. This treatment may not work if your case is severe. Surgery. If you're in serious pain or if the cyst makes it hard for you to move your knee, this might be an option. But it'll only work if your doctor also treats the issue that caused the Baker's cyst to begin with, such as arthritis. Exercise. A physical therapist can teach you gentle exercises to help improve your range of motion and strengthening moves to build up the muscles around your knee. This could ease your symptoms. RICE: Rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Rest the joint when you can, use a compression bandage, apply ice, and raise your knee, especially at night. If your leg turns red or starts to swell, see your doctor right away. This could mean your Baker's cyst has burst. Possibly -- by preventing knee injuries in the first place. Wear the right shoes when you work out. Be sure to warm up before you exercise. And if you do get a knee injury, take care of it right away. See your doctor if it doesn't get better.

Animals that sniff, slurp, lick, and gobble anything in their paths, including dirt, trash, and poop, are bound to pick up pests. All the things they do with their mouths -- groom, kiss, wrestle, and other social habits -- can pass along unwanted guests to playmates and companions, canine and human alike. \x1b[92m[2] Parasites worm their way into most dogs‚Äô lives at one time or another\x1b[0m. Your vet may suspect worms if your dog has diarrhea or is vomiting, coughing, chewing or licking under his tail, short of breath, or losing weight. The symptoms and treatments depend on the type of worm and where it's living in your dog‚Äôs body. \x1b[92m[3] Most worms that infect dogs -- including roundworms, tapeworms, hookworms, and whipworms -- live in the intestines\x1b[0m, so that‚Äôs the first place for your vet to look. If it‚Äôs time for your dog‚Äôs annual check-up, or if you or your vet thinks your dog has worms, provide a fresh stool sample. Simply scoop up some of your pet‚Äôs poop, seal it in a clean plastic bag, and bring it to the appointment. If you can't do that, your vet can take a sample during the office visit. He'll check it under a microscope to see if it has worms or worm eggs, and, if so, what kind. Heartworms are another type of canine invader that can cause serious health problems or sometimes even death. These foot-long worms live in the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Mosquitoes carry the worms‚Äô offspring from one dog‚Äôs blood to another‚Äôs. The vet will do a blood test to tell if your dog has heartworms. There are many safe ways to de-worm your dog. The sooner the worms are gone, the sooner your pet will get healthy and feel better. Your vet will give your dog medicine by mouth or in a shot to kill the worms. Many of these drugs are described as ‚Äúbroad-spectrum,‚Äù because they're good for treating a wide range of parasites, including worms that live in the gut. They're poisonous to pests, but safe for pets. \x1b[92m[5] Because worms are so common in puppies, vets recommend de-worming them for the first time when they're 2 to 3 weeks old\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Worms can pass from mother to baby before birth or soon after, through her milk\x1b[0m. It will take more than one dose. The first round kills the worms that are there at the time. The second kills those that hatch a few weeks later. Rarely, your vet may want to give your puppy blood, because hookworms drain blood from the wall of the intestines, which can cause anemia. Treatment is much the same for adult dogs with worms. The same kinds of drugs are used, but your dog will get more of the medicine. If your dog has heartworms, your vet will need to do blood work, take X-rays, and maybe do other tests to see how serious the infection is. Just the tests can cost $1,000 or more, but they're necessary. Initially, your dog will be started on monthly heartworm prevention along with an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory. A month later, the heartworm treatment starts. This is a strong medicine that should only be given by a vet. Typically, your dog gets a series of three shots over a 2-month period. But that‚Äôs not the end of the treatment. You'll need to keep your dog calm and quiet for several months after the shots. When heartworms die they break into pieces. These chunks can block blood from flowing to the heart or lungs. When that happens -- and there is a greater chance when blood pumps harder, such as during exercise -- a dog could die. Your vet will give you tips to make sure your sick dog gets rest so he can recover safely. Six months after the heartworm treatment, your vet will do a blood test to check for worms. If they're still there, your dog will need another round of shots. If they're all gone, you continue the preventive medicine for the rest of your dog‚Äôs life and test for heartworms each year. \x1b[92m[6] The best way to protect your pet is to control the pests that carry worms, including fleas and mosquitoes, and keep your home and yard clean\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] You'll be doing yourself a favor, too, because some types of worms can be passed to humans\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Follow these simple steps to ward off worms: Make sure your vet checks your dog for all kinds of worms at least once a year (two to four times for puppies)\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] Keep your dog flea-free\x1b[0m. You can buy flea collars or medicine to put on your dog‚Äôs skin. There are also flea control treatments that you can give to your dog by mouth. \x1b[92m[10] Get a prescription from your vet for the drug to prevent heartworms, and give it to your dog once a month\x1b[0m. Never skip a dose. Ask your vet about an injection that can be given to your dog every six months, called Pro Heart. \x1b[92m[11] Practice the four Ps: Pick up (and throw away) Pet Poop Promptly\x1b[0m.

They're poisonous to pests, but safe for pets. \x1b[92m[5] Because worms are so common in puppies, vets recommend de-worming them for the first time when they're 2 to 3 weeks old\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Worms can pass from mother to baby before birth or soon after, through her milk\x1b[0m. It will take more than one dose. The first round kills the worms that are there at the time. The second kills those that hatch a few weeks later. Rarely, your vet may want to give your puppy blood, because hookworms drain blood from the wall of the intestines, which can cause anemia. Treatment is much the same for adult dogs with worms. The same kinds of drugs are used, but your dog will get more of the medicine. If your dog has heartworms, your vet will need to do blood work, take X-rays, and maybe do other tests to see how serious the infection is. Just the tests can cost $1,000 or more, but they're necessary. Initially, your dog will be started on monthly heartworm prevention along with an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory. A month later, the heartworm treatment starts. This is a strong medicine that should only be given by a vet. Typically, your dog gets a series of three shots over a 2-month period. But that‚Äôs not the end of the treatment. You'll need to keep your dog calm and quiet for several months after the shots. When heartworms die they break into pieces. These chunks can block blood from flowing to the heart or lungs. When that happens -- and there is a greater chance when blood pumps harder, such as during exercise -- a dog could die. Your vet will give you tips to make sure your sick dog gets rest so he can recover safely. Six months after the heartworm treatment, your vet will do a blood test to check for worms. If they're still there, your dog will need another round of shots. If they're all gone, you continue the preventive medicine for the rest of your dog‚Äôs life and test for heartworms each year. \x1b[92m[6] The best way to protect your pet is to control the pests that carry worms, including fleas and mosquitoes, and keep your home and yard clean\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] You'll be doing yourself a favor, too, because some types of worms can be passed to humans\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Follow these simple steps to ward off worms: Make sure your vet checks your dog for all kinds of worms at least once a year (two to four times for puppies)\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] Keep your dog flea-free\x1b[0m. You can buy flea collars or medicine to put on your dog‚Äôs skin. There are also flea control treatments that you can give to your dog by mouth. \x1b[92m[10] Get a prescription from your vet for the drug to prevent heartworms, and give it to your dog once a month\x1b[0m. Never skip a dose. Ask your vet about an injection that can be given to your dog every six months, called Pro Heart. \x1b[92m[11] Practice the four Ps: Pick up (and throw away) Pet Poop Promptly\x1b[0m. Clear your yard at least weekly and scoop up after your dog when you go for a walk. \x1b[92m[12] Wash your hands often, including after you pet animals and especially after picking up their waste\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[13] If you‚Äôre worried about catching worms from dogs, don't let them lick or kiss you or your kids\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[14] And make them sleep on their own bed -- not yours\x1b[0m.""]",6BBinbmBretqjJt,"[5.49963712692261,3.89919781684875,4.82263493537903,4.50007605552673,4.73407030105591,5.16695141792297,3.72981429100037,9.87159967422485,4.47132301330566,4.48045659065247,5.24655771255493,3.91733717918396,4.88582038879395,2.07843780517578]",2024-09-06 21:11:19.946923+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":3},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":4},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":5},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":6},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":7},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":8},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":9},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":10},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":11},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":12},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":13}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":3},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":4},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":5},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":6},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":7},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":8},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":9},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":10},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":11},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":12},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":13}]","[True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, False, True, False, True, True, True]",2,1

This is because it is absorbed more slowly by the body. \x1b[92m[3] Some types of gum or oral care products, such as toothpaste and mouthwash\x1b[0m, also contain xylitol. Mouth bacteria can't use xylitol as a source of energy, so it may help prevent tooth decay and the buildup of plaque. Researchers have studied the use of xylitol to prevent sudden attacks of middle ear inflammation (otitis media) in children with frequent earaches. One way it may help is by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. More studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness for this and other uses. Optimal doses of xylitol have not been set for any condition. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely from maker to maker. This makes it difficult to set a standard dose. Xylitol is extracted from plant material. The amount naturally found in foods is very small. However, it is increasingly found as an ingredient (additiive) in more and more foods and health products.

Xylitol is mostly safe, especially if taken in amounts found in food. The FDA has approved xylitol as a food additive or sweetener. Side effects. If you take large amounts of xylitol, such as 30 to 40 grams, you may experience diarrhea or gas. Increasing the dose gradually may help minimize these effects. Risks. There is not enough information to confirm xylitol's safety in pregnant and breastfeeding women, so they should not use it for medicinal purposes.

44,134,"[""https://www.webmd.com/men/guide/mental-health-male-sexual-problems\nA sexual problem, or sexual dysfunction, refers to a problem during any phase of the sexual response cycle that prevents the man or couple from experiencing satisfaction from the activity. The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. While research suggests that sexual dysfunction is common (43% of women and 31% of men report some degree of difficulty), it is a topic that many people are hesitant to discuss. Fortunately, most cases of sexual dysfunction are treatable, so it is important to share your concerns with your partner and doctor. Sexual dysfunction in men can be a result of a physical or psychological problem. Physical causes: Many physical and medical conditions can cause problems with sexual function. These conditions include diabetes, heart and vascular (blood vessel) disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, chronic diseases such as kidney or liver failure, and alcoholism and drug abuse. In addition, the side effects of certain medications, including some antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual desire and function. Psychological causes: These include work-related stress and anxiety, concern about sexual performance, marital or relationship problems, depression, feelings of guilt, and the effects of a past sexual trauma. Both men and women are affected by sexual problems. Sexual problems occur in adults of all ages. Among those commonly affected are those in the geriatric population, which may be related to a decline in health associated with aging. The most common sexual problems in men are ejaculation disorders, erectile dysfunction, and inhibited sexual desire. There are different types of ejaculation disorders in men, including: Premature ejaculation: This refers to ejaculation that occurs before or soon after penetration. Inhibited or retarded ejaculation: This is when ejaculation is slow to occur. Retrograde ejaculation: This occurs when, at orgasm, the ejaculate is forced back into the bladder rather than through the urethra and out the end of the penis. In some cases, premature and inhibited ejaculation are caused by psychological factors, including a strict religious background that causes the person to view sex as sinful, a lack of attraction for a partner, and past traumatic events. Premature ejaculation, the most common form of sexual dysfunction in men, often is due to nervousness over how well he will perform during sex. Certain drugs, including some antidepressants, may affect ejaculation, as can nerve damage to the spinal cord or back. Retrograde ejaculation is common in males with diabetes who suffer from diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). This is due to problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that allow the ejaculate to flow backward. In other men, retrograde ejaculation occurs after operations on the bladder neck or prostate, or after certain abdominal operations. In addition, certain medications, particularly those used to treat mood disorders, may cause problems with ejaculation. Also known as impotence, erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to attain and/or maintain an erection suitable for intercourse. Causes of erectile dysfunction include diseases affecting blood flow, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries); nerve disorders; psychological factors, such as stress, depression, and performance anxiety (nervousness over his ability to sexually perform); and injury to the penis. Chronic illness, certain drugs, and a condition called Peyronie's disease (scar tissue in the penis) also can cause erectile dysfunction. Inhibited desire, or loss of libido, refers to a decrease in desire for, or interest in sexual activity. Reduced libido can result from physical or psychological factors. It has been associated with low levels of the hormone testosterone. It also may be caused by psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression; medical illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure; certain medications, including some antidepressants; and relationship difficulties. To diagnose a man's sexual problem, the doctor likely will begin with a thorough history of symptoms and a physical exam. He or she may order other tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the dysfunction. The doctor may refer you to other health professionals, including a urologist (a doctor specializing in the urinary tract and male reproductive system), sex therapist, and other counselors. Many cases of sexual dysfunction can be corrected by treating the underlying physical or psychological problems. Treatment strategies may include the following: Medical treatment: This involves treatment of any physical problem that may be contributing to a man's sexual dysfunction. Medications: Medications, such as Cialis, Levitra, Staxyn, Stendra, or Viagra may help improve erectile function in men by increasing blood flow to the penis. Promescent is a drug used to treat premature ejaculation. The topical spray is applied to the penis and contains lidocaine, reducing sensitivity and allowing for more ejaculation control. Hormones: Men with low levelsof testosterone may benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Psychological therapy: Therapy with a trained counselor can help a person address feelings of anxiety, fear, or guilt that may have an impact on sexual function. Mechanical aids: Aids such as vacuum devices and penile implants may help men with erectile dysfunction. Education and communication: Education about sex and sexual behaviors and responses may help a man overcome his anxieties about sexual performance. Open dialogue with your partner about your needs and concerns also helps to overcome many barriers to a healthy sex life. The success of treatment for sexual dysfunction depends on the underlying cause of the problem. The outlook is good for dysfunction that is related to a treatable or reversible physical condition. Mild dysfunction that is related to stress, fear, or anxiety often can be successfully treated with counseling, education, and improved communication between partners. While sexual problems cannot be prevented, dealing with the underlying causes of the dysfunction can help you better understand and cope with the problem when it occurs. There are some things you can do to help maintain good sexual function: Follow your doctor's treatment plan for any medical/health conditions. Limit your alcohol intake. Quit smoking.

The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. While research suggests that sexual dysfunction is common (43% of women and 31% of men report some degree of difficulty), it is a topic that many people are hesitant to discuss. Fortunately, most cases of sexual dysfunction are treatable, so it is important to share your concerns with your partner and doctor. Sexual dysfunction in men can be a result of a physical or psychological problem. Physical causes: Many physical and medical conditions can cause problems with sexual function. These conditions include diabetes, heart and vascular (blood vessel) disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, chronic diseases such as kidney or liver failure, and alcoholism and drug abuse. In addition, the side effects of certain medications, including some antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual desire and function. Psychological causes: These include work-related stress and anxiety, concern about sexual performance, marital or relationship problems, depression, feelings of guilt, and the effects of a past sexual trauma. Both men and women are affected by sexual problems. Sexual problems occur in adults of all ages. Among those commonly affected are those in the geriatric population, which may be related to a decline in health associated with aging. The most common sexual problems in men are ejaculation disorders, erectile dysfunction, and inhibited sexual desire. There are different types of ejaculation disorders in men, including: Premature ejaculation: This refers to ejaculation that occurs before or soon after penetration. Inhibited or retarded ejaculation: This is when ejaculation is slow to occur. Retrograde ejaculation: This occurs when, at orgasm, the ejaculate is forced back into the bladder rather than through the urethra and out the end of the penis. In some cases, premature and inhibited ejaculation are caused by psychological factors, including a strict religious background that causes the person to view sex as sinful, a lack of attraction for a partner, and past traumatic events. Premature ejaculation, the most common form of sexual dysfunction in men, often is due to nervousness over how well he will perform during sex. Certain drugs, including some antidepressants, may affect ejaculation, as can nerve damage to the spinal cord or back. Retrograde ejaculation is common in males with diabetes who suffer from diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). This is due to problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that allow the ejaculate to flow backward. In other men, retrograde ejaculation occurs after operations on the bladder neck or prostate, or after certain abdominal operations. In addition, certain medications, particularly those used to treat mood disorders, may cause problems with ejaculation. Also known as impotence, erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to attain and/or maintain an erection suitable for intercourse. Causes of erectile dysfunction include diseases affecting blood flow, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries); nerve disorders; psychological factors, such as stress, depression, and performance anxiety (nervousness over his ability to sexually perform); and injury to the penis. Chronic illness, certain drugs, and a condition called Peyronie's disease (scar tissue in the penis) also can cause erectile dysfunction. Inhibited desire, or loss of libido, refers to a decrease in desire for, or interest in sexual activity. Reduced libido can result from physical or psychological factors. It has been associated with low levels of the hormone testosterone. It also may be caused by psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression; medical illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure; certain medications, including some antidepressants; and relationship difficulties. To diagnose a man's sexual problem, the doctor likely will begin with a thorough history of symptoms and a physical exam. He or she may order other tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the dysfunction. The doctor may refer you to other health professionals, including a urologist (a doctor specializing in the urinary tract and male reproductive system), sex therapist, and other counselors. Many cases of sexual dysfunction can be corrected by treating the underlying physical or psychological problems. Treatment strategies may include the following: Medical treatment: This involves treatment of any physical problem that may be contributing to a man's sexual dysfunction. Medications: Medications, such as Cialis, Levitra, Staxyn, Stendra, or Viagra may help improve erectile function in men by increasing blood flow to the penis. Promescent is a drug used to treat premature ejaculation. The topical spray is applied to the penis and contains lidocaine, reducing sensitivity and allowing for more ejaculation control. Hormones: Men with low levelsof testosterone may benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Psychological therapy: Therapy with a trained counselor can help a person address feelings of anxiety, fear, or guilt that may have an impact on sexual function. Mechanical aids: Aids such as vacuum devices and penile implants may help men with erectile dysfunction. Education and communication: Education about sex and sexual behaviors and responses may help a man overcome his anxieties about sexual performance. Open dialogue with your partner about your needs and concerns also helps to overcome many barriers to a healthy sex life. The success of treatment for sexual dysfunction depends on the underlying cause of the problem. The outlook is good for dysfunction that is related to a treatable or reversible physical condition. Mild dysfunction that is related to stress, fear, or anxiety often can be successfully treated with counseling, education, and improved communication between partners.

46,166,"[""https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/broken-arm\nA broken or fractured arm means that one or more of the bones of the arm have been cracked. This is a common injury occurring in both children and adults. In adults, fractures of the arm account for nearly half of all broken bones. In children, fractures of the forearm are second only to broken collarbones. The arm consists of 3 major bones. The humerus runs from the shoulder to the elbow. This is called the upper arm, or, simply, the arm. At the elbow, the humerus connects with 2 bones: the radius and the ulna. These bones go from the elbow to the wrist and are regarded as the forearm. Almost all injuries to the arm that result in a broken bone are caused in 2 ways: falls and direct trauma. The typical fall that produces a fracture occurs when you fall on your outstretched hand. The location of the fracture can be from the wrist up to the shoulder depending on the direction of the fall, the age of the person, and other factors that modify the stresses applied to the bone. Direct trauma can be from a direct blow from an object such as a bat, the trauma during a car accident, or any accident that causes the direct application of force to a part of the arm. Most broken arms have these symptoms: A large amount of pain and increased pain when moving the arm Swelling Maybe an obvious deformity compared to the other arm Possible open wound either from the bone puncturing the skin or from the skin being cut during the injury Decreased sensation or inability to move the limb, which may indicate nerve damage Call your doctor after an accident if these signs are present: Significant pain that is not relieved by ice and home pain medications such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Motrin) A large amount of swelling or mild deformity of the arm compared to the opposite arm Significant pain with use or limited use of the affected arm Pain in one specific part of the arm when it is pressed Your doctor may advise you to go directly to a hospital's emergency department. Under the following conditions, go directly to the hospital for emergency care: Visible bone sticking out through the skin Heavy bleeding from an open wound Complete lack of movement or sensation of part of the arm Obvious deformity that looks drastically different from the usual appearance Loss of consciousness Many other injuries The initial evaluation by any physician, in the office or in the emergency department, begins with a thorough history and physical exam. By finding out the details of the accident, the doctor may be able to determine what damage was done based on the mechanism of the trauma. After taking a history, the physician will do a complete physical exam with special focus on the painful areas. The doctor is looking for signs of a fracture (such as swelling or deformity) and checking for possible nerve or blood vessel damage. X-rays are typically the test used to assess for broken bones. At least 2 views of the arm are taken. Initially, most broken bones will have an apparent fracture or other abnormality on the x-ray. Some fractures are not always visible on the first set of x-rays. In those instances, a CT scan or MRI may be done immediately for further evaluation, or follow-up x-rays may be obtained at a later date. The most important aspect of first aid is to stabilize the arm. Do this by using a towel as a sling. Place it under the arm and then around the neck. An alternate approach to keep the arm from moving is to position a rolled and taped newspaper along the swollen area and to tape it in place. Apply ice to the injured area. This can help to decrease pain and swelling. Place ice in a bag and leave it on the arm for 20-30 minutes at a time. It may be helpful to place a towel around the ice bag or in between the bag and the skin to protect the skin from getting too cold. Never put ice directly on the skin. The most important aspect of treating fractures is to determine which ones can be treated with outpatient care and which require admission to the hospital. In most instances, the broken arm will be able to be treated in the emergency department. Most fractures will need to have a splint or partial cast applied to stabilize the broken bones. Some breaks especially in the upper arm and shoulder may only need to be immobilized in a sling. In addition to splinting the broken arm, the physician will prescribe medicines for pain control and ice to decrease swelling. Typically, wounds that warrant admission to the hospital are these: Bones that have gone through the skin or have lacerations over the broken area Fractures that are associated with nerve damage Fractures that are associated with blood vessel damage Complicated fractures that have multiple breaks, involve the joints, or are unable to be stabilized in the emergency department or doctor's office Most broken arms will not require admission to the hospital. For all other fractures, the treating doctor will suggest you follow up with an orthopedic doctor (bone specialist). At that time, the orthopedist will determine what further care (continued splinting, casting, or surgery) is necessary based on the type of fracture. Additional follow-up instructions for fractures include the following: Wear any support device (splint, sling, or brace, for example) until the doctor sees you for follow-up. Keep your splint or cast clean and dry. Apply ice to the injured area for 20-30 minutes 4-5 times a day. Keep your arm elevated above the heart as much as possible to decrease swelling. Use pillows to prop your arm while in bed or sitting in a chair. Take pain medicine as prescribed. Do not drink or drive if you are taking narcotic pain medication. Call your doctor for increased pain, loss of sensation, or if your fingers or hand turn cold or blue.

This is a common injury occurring in both children and adults. In adults, fractures of the arm account for nearly half of all broken bones. In children, fractures of the forearm are second only to broken collarbones. The arm consists of 3 major bones. The humerus runs from the shoulder to the elbow. This is called the upper arm, or, simply, the arm. At the elbow, the humerus connects with 2 bones: the radius and the ulna. These bones go from the elbow to the wrist and are regarded as the forearm. Almost all injuries to the arm that result in a broken bone are caused in 2 ways: falls and direct trauma. The typical fall that produces a fracture occurs when you fall on your outstretched hand. The location of the fracture can be from the wrist up to the shoulder depending on the direction of the fall, the age of the person, and other factors that modify the stresses applied to the bone. Direct trauma can be from a direct blow from an object such as a bat, the trauma during a car accident, or any accident that causes the direct application of force to a part of the arm. Most broken arms have these symptoms: A large amount of pain and increased pain when moving the arm Swelling Maybe an obvious deformity compared to the other arm Possible open wound either from the bone puncturing the skin or from the skin being cut during the injury Decreased sensation or inability to move the limb, which may indicate nerve damage Call your doctor after an accident if these signs are present: Significant pain that is not relieved by ice and home pain medications such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Motrin) A large amount of swelling or mild deformity of the arm compared to the opposite arm Significant pain with use or limited use of the affected arm Pain in one specific part of the arm when it is pressed Your doctor may advise you to go directly to a hospital's emergency department. Under the following conditions, go directly to the hospital for emergency care: Visible bone sticking out through the skin Heavy bleeding from an open wound Complete lack of movement or sensation of part of the arm Obvious deformity that looks drastically different from the usual appearance Loss of consciousness Many other injuries The initial evaluation by any physician, in the office or in the emergency department, begins with a thorough history and physical exam. By finding out the details of the accident, the doctor may be able to determine what damage was done based on the mechanism of the trauma. After taking a history, the physician will do a complete physical exam with special focus on the painful areas. The doctor is looking for signs of a fracture (such as swelling or deformity) and checking for possible nerve or blood vessel damage. X-rays are typically the test used to assess for broken bones. At least 2 views of the arm are taken. Initially, most broken bones will have an apparent fracture or other abnormality on the x-ray. Some fractures are not always visible on the first set of x-rays. In those instances, a CT scan or MRI may be done immediately for further evaluation, or follow-up x-rays may be obtained at a later date. The most important aspect of first aid is to stabilize the arm. Do this by using a towel as a sling. Place it under the arm and then around the neck. An alternate approach to keep the arm from moving is to position a rolled and taped newspaper along the swollen area and to tape it in place. Apply ice to the injured area. This can help to decrease pain and swelling. Place ice in a bag and leave it on the arm for 20-30 minutes at a time. It may be helpful to place a towel around the ice bag or in between the bag and the skin to protect the skin from getting too cold. Never put ice directly on the skin. The most important aspect of treating fractures is to determine which ones can be treated with outpatient care and which require admission to the hospital. In most instances, the broken arm will be able to be treated in the emergency department. Most fractures will need to have a splint or partial cast applied to stabilize the broken bones. Some breaks especially in the upper arm and shoulder may only need to be immobilized in a sling. In addition to splinting the broken arm, the physician will prescribe medicines for pain control and ice to decrease swelling. Typically, wounds that warrant admission to the hospital are these: Bones that have gone through the skin or have lacerations over the broken area Fractures that are associated with nerve damage Fractures that are associated with blood vessel damage Complicated fractures that have multiple breaks, involve the joints, or are unable to be stabilized in the emergency department or doctor's office Most broken arms will not require admission to the hospital. For all other fractures, the treating doctor will suggest you follow up with an orthopedic doctor (bone specialist). At that time, the orthopedist will determine what further care (continued splinting, casting, or surgery) is necessary based on the type of fracture. Additional follow-up instructions for fractures include the following: Wear any support device (splint, sling, or brace, for example) until the doctor sees you for follow-up. Keep your splint or cast clean and dry. Apply ice to the injured area for 20-30 minutes 4-5 times a day. Keep your arm elevated above the heart as much as possible to decrease swelling. Use pillows to prop your arm while in bed or sitting in a chair. Take pain medicine as prescribed. Do not drink or drive if you are taking narcotic pain medication. Call your doctor for increased pain, loss of sensation, or if your fingers or hand turn cold or blue. There are 2 main ways to help prevent a broken arm.

For some people, life\'s stressors cause them to become irritable, short-tempered, or unable to concentrate on tasks. Others have interrupted sleep (trouble falling asleep or waking early in the morning with racing thoughts). Then there are those who react by eating junk food -- and a lot of it! ( Remember - desserts is stressed spelled backward!) The good news: No matter how busy your schedule, it is possible to manage stress and keep it from ruining your life. Simply stated, stress describes the many demands and pressures that we all experience, to some degree, each day. These demands are physical, mental, emotional, or even chemical in nature. The word ""stress"" encompasses both the stressful situation, known as the stressor, and the symptoms you experience under stress, your stress response. The problem with stress is that it activates your sympathetic nervous system, stimulating the release of stress hormones throughout your body. These hormones give you super energy and cause other changes in the body such as the ""fight or flight"" response. The ""fight or flight"" response makes your heart beat faster. You might feel very nervous, making it difficult to breathe. Short term, the ""fight or flight"" response causes changes that allow you to handle sudden stressful events. When you face fear -- or even recall a stressful or frightening event from the past -- the resulting hormonal changes super-charge your body to a state of high arousal. This prepares you for action. But long-term stress can be particularly difficult. When stress hormones stay elevated over time, there is a gradual and steady stream of harmful changes to the body. Long-term stress can suppress the immune system, which may lead to the development of diseases. Stress can be positive or negative, depending on the situation. Positive stressors (called eustress) may include an upcoming wedding, the holidays, or pregnancy. On the other hand, negative stress (called distress) results in the full-blown stress response. If continuous, negative stress can lead to loss of productivity, health problems, and exhaustion. Stress symptoms vary greatly from one person to the next, but the most universal sign of stress is a feeling of being pressured or overwhelmed. Other symptoms include: Physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches, chest pains, nausea, and diarrhea, and a sensation of numbness or tingling in your hands, arms, and face.) Problems getting along with family members, friends, and teachers. Changes in behavior at home (short temper, unexplained anger, crying for no reason). Regression -- behavior that is not age-appropriate. Dysfunctional sleep patterns, including nightmares, too little sleep, difficulty falling asleep, or even oversleeping. Communication difficulty or personality changes, such as becoming withdrawn or requiring much more attention than usual. Impatience. \x1b[92m[1] If you are experiencing a few of these symptoms, chances are that your level of stress is high\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] If left untreated, stress can lead to permanent feelings of helplessness and ineffectiveness\x1b[0m. Now that you understand more about stress and the symptoms, try the following these 6 tips to unwind, de-stress, and get back in control of your emotional state: Identify the sources of stress. Try to figure out what\'s causing your stress symptoms. Maybe you are overextended (too many commitments) and feel fatigued and irritable. Once you identify the sources of stress, try to minimize these as much as possible. Talk it out. Talk to a friend, family member, or therapist if your stress level is too high. Getting your feelings out without others judging you is crucial to good mental health. Take time out. Before you reach your breaking point, take time out for solitude. Take time to nurture yourself, away from the cares and responsibilities of the world. Find time for inner strength and emotional healing. Set limits. Never hesitate to say ""no"" before you take on too many commitments. Especially if you are balancing work and family, it\'s important to prioritize. Saying ""no"" can help bring your stress to a manageable level and give you more control over your life. Try exhaling. Breathing can measure and alter your psychological state, making a stressful moment increase or diminish in intensity. Often, people who are anxious or upset take shallow breaths and unconsciously hold them. By paying attention to your breathing, particularly exhaling during tense moments, you will feel more relaxed. Buy a bottle of inexpensive bubbles (in the toy section at most stores), and use it to learn how to exhale slowly. Breathing from your abdomen, blow through the bubble blower with a steady stream of breath. If you blow too hard or too softly, you won\'t get any bubbles. But smooth, steady breaths will produce a nice flow of bubbles. Use this breathing technique (without the bubbles) when you are feeling stressed. Exercise daily. Exercise is thought to increase the secretion of endorphins, naturally produced substances in the brain that induce feelings of peacefulness. Many studies show that exercise, along with the boosted endorphin levels, really does increase confidence and self-esteem and reduce tension. Exercise also acts as a displacement defense mechanism for those who are ""stressed out."" What does that mean? If you\'ve ever walked for several miles, you know how hard it is to think of your problems when your mind is focused on walking. The problem with stress is that it\'s cumulative. In other words, if you don\'t have a healthy way of responding to stress or counterbalancing the ""fight or flight"" response, constant exposure to stress hormones overloads the body. Changes in levels of hormones produced by daily stress can hurt your health. When stress levels increase, it results in an overproduction of stress hormones that weaken the immune system. This can lead to physical and psychological problems. Chronic, or long-term, stress often results in high anxiety, insomnia, depression, gastrointestinal problems, and can even lead to dependency on drugs and alcohol (a self-medication solution that makes an already bad problem worse). Some studies show that the hormones associated with chronic stress are linked to increased fat in the abdomen. That, in turn, increases the risk of chronic and serious illness such as diabetes. \x1b[92m[3] When stress interrupts your life, causing sleep problems or making you feel anxious and out of control, talk with your primary health care professional\x1b[0m.

This can lead to physical and psychological problems. Chronic, or long-term, stress often results in high anxiety, insomnia, depression, gastrointestinal problems, and can even lead to dependency on drugs and alcohol (a self-medication solution that makes an already bad problem worse). Some studies show that the hormones associated with chronic stress are linked to increased fat in the abdomen. That, in turn, increases the risk of chronic and serious illness such as diabetes.

We all live with it each day. But how do you react to daily stress? For some people, life\'s stressors cause them to become irritable, short-tempered, or unable to concentrate on tasks. Others have interrupted sleep (trouble falling asleep or waking early in the morning with racing thoughts). Then there are those who react by eating junk food -- and a lot of it! ( Remember - desserts is stressed spelled backward!) The good news: No matter how busy your schedule, it is possible to manage stress and keep it from ruining your life. Simply stated, stress describes the many demands and pressures that we all experience, to some degree, each day. These demands are physical, mental, emotional, or even chemical in nature. The word ""stress"" encompasses both the stressful situation, known as the stressor, and the symptoms you experience under stress, your stress response. The problem with stress is that it activates your sympathetic nervous system, stimulating the release of stress hormones throughout your body. These hormones give you super energy and cause other changes in the body such as the ""fight or flight"" response. The ""fight or flight"" response makes your heart beat faster. You might feel very nervous, making it difficult to breathe. Short term, the ""fight or flight"" response causes changes that allow you to handle sudden stressful events. When you face fear -- or even recall a stressful or frightening event from the past -- the resulting hormonal changes super-charge your body to a state of high arousal. This prepares you for action. But long-term stress can be particularly difficult. When stress hormones stay elevated over time, there is a gradual and steady stream of harmful changes to the body. Long-term stress can suppress the immune system, which may lead to the development of diseases. Stress can be positive or negative, depending on the situation. Positive stressors (called eustress) may include an upcoming wedding, the holidays, or pregnancy. On the other hand, negative stress (called distress) results in the full-blown stress response. If continuous, negative stress can lead to loss of productivity, health problems, and exhaustion. Stress symptoms vary greatly from one person to the next, but the most universal sign of stress is a feeling of being pressured or overwhelmed. Other symptoms include: Physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches, chest pains, nausea, and diarrhea, and a sensation of numbness or tingling in your hands, arms, and face.) Problems getting along with family members, friends, and teachers. Changes in behavior at home (short temper, unexplained anger, crying for no reason). Regression -- behavior that is not age-appropriate. Dysfunctional sleep patterns, including nightmares, too little sleep, difficulty falling asleep, or even oversleeping. Communication difficulty or personality changes, such as becoming withdrawn or requiring much more attention than usual. Impatience. \x1b[92m[1] If you are experiencing a few of these symptoms, chances are that your level of stress is high\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] If left untreated, stress can lead to permanent feelings of helplessness and ineffectiveness\x1b[0m. Now that you understand more about stress and the symptoms, try the following these 6 tips to unwind, de-stress, and get back in control of your emotional state: Identify the sources of stress. Try to figure out what\'s causing your stress symptoms. Maybe you are overextended (too many commitments) and feel fatigued and irritable. Once you identify the sources of stress, try to minimize these as much as possible. Talk it out. Talk to a friend, family member, or therapist if your stress level is too high. Getting your feelings out without others judging you is crucial to good mental health. Take time out. Before you reach your breaking point, take time out for solitude. Take time to nurture yourself, away from the cares and responsibilities of the world. Find time for inner strength and emotional healing. Set limits. Never hesitate to say ""no"" before you take on too many commitments. Especially if you are balancing work and family, it\'s important to prioritize. Saying ""no"" can help bring your stress to a manageable level and give you more control over your life. Try exhaling. Breathing can measure and alter your psychological state, making a stressful moment increase or diminish in intensity. Often, people who are anxious or upset take shallow breaths and unconsciously hold them. By paying attention to your breathing, particularly exhaling during tense moments, you will feel more relaxed. Buy a bottle of inexpensive bubbles (in the toy section at most stores), and use it to learn how to exhale slowly. Breathing from your abdomen, blow through the bubble blower with a steady stream of breath. If you blow too hard or too softly, you won\'t get any bubbles. But smooth, steady breaths will produce a nice flow of bubbles. Use this breathing technique (without the bubbles) when you are feeling stressed. Exercise daily. Exercise is thought to increase the secretion of endorphins, naturally produced substances in the brain that induce feelings of peacefulness. Many studies show that exercise, along with the boosted endorphin levels, really does increase confidence and self-esteem and reduce tension. Exercise also acts as a displacement defense mechanism for those who are ""stressed out."" What does that mean? If you\'ve ever walked for several miles, you know how hard it is to think of your problems when your mind is focused on walking. The problem with stress is that it\'s cumulative. In other words, if you don\'t have a healthy way of responding to stress or counterbalancing the ""fight or flight"" response, constant exposure to stress hormones overloads the body. Changes in levels of hormones produced by daily stress can hurt your health. When stress levels increase, it results in an overproduction of stress hormones that weaken the immune system. This can lead to physical and psychological problems. Chronic, or long-term, stress often results in high anxiety, insomnia, depression, gastrointestinal problems, and can even lead to dependency on drugs and alcohol (a self-medication solution that makes an already bad problem worse). Some studies show that the hormones associated with chronic stress are linked to increased fat in the abdomen.

It can cause symptoms such as intense pain and throbbing as blood collects under the nail. Unless you also have broken bones or damage to the nail bed and/or surrounding tissues, this injury usually isn't worrisome. These injuries can happen easily. You might: Slam your finger in a car door or house door Hit your finger with a heavy object such as a hammer Drop a heavy object such as a dumbbell on your toe Stub your toe on a hard surface If you have a darkened area under a nail and haven't had an injury, see your doctor to rule out other possible causes. \x1b[92m[3] The most common symptom is severe, throbbing pain\x1b[0m. It happens because of the pressure of blood collecting between the nail and the nail bed. You may also have: A dark-colored discoloration (red, maroon, or purple-black) under all or part of the affected nail Tenderness and swelling of the tip of the affected finger or toe If you had a severe blow to a finger or toe, either seek immediate medical attention from your doctor or go to an emergency room. You should do this in case you have broken bones or serious damage to the nail bed and/or surrounding tissues. Your doctor will examine your nail. You'll probably also have an X-ray taken to see if you have a bone fracture or other injury. A painless and small subungual hematoma usually doesn't need treatment. But the pressure generated by pooled blood under the nail can be extremely painful. \x1b[92m[4] To relieve the pain, your doctor may perform decompression, also called trephination, which allows the underlying blood to drain, relieving pressure and pain to the area\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Your doctor may numb the affected finger or toe with a nerve block and use one of the following decompression methods: Cautery\x1b[0m. The doctor uses a heated wire (electrocautery device) or carbon laser to burn a hole or holes. The heated tip of the wire is cooled by contact with the hematoma, which prevents injury to the nail bed. This is a quick and painless procedure. \x1b[92m[6] Needle\x1b[0m. The doctor uses a needle to make a hole in the nail. \x1b[92m[7] After the procedure, your doctor will bandage your nail\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] You will need to keep the finger or toe bandaged and elevated -- and may also need to use cold compresses -- during the first 12 hours after decompression\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] In some cases, your doctor may recommend you use a splint for as long as 3 days until the tenderness subsides\x1b[0m. The main complication associated with decompression is a small risk of infection in the residual hematoma. If you have bleeding under a large area of the nail surface, the nail bed may be injured. In this case, your doctor may need to remove the entire nail and use stitches to repair the nail bed. Unless the area of bleeding is very small, an affected nail will usually fall off on its own after several weeks because the pooled blood has separated it from its bed. A new fingernail can regrow in as little as 8 weeks. A new toenail may not fully regrow for about 6 months. \x1b[92m[10] If there has been injury to the nail bed and/or surrounding tissues, the new nail may take longer to grow\x1b[0m.

Newborns prefer to look at faces over other shapes and objects and at round shapes with light and dark borders (such as your adoring eyes). Just after birth, a baby sees only in black and white, with shades of gray. As the months go by, he/she will slowly start to develop his color vision at around 4 months.

These are usually yellow-green in color. They're the most common kind, accounting for 80% of gallstones. Pigment stones. These stones are smaller and darker.

Your body needs bile, but if it has too much cholesterol in it, that makes gallstones more likely. It can also happen if your gallbladder can't empty properly. Pigment stones are more common in people with certain medical conditions, such as cirrhosis (a liver disease) or blood diseases such as sickle cell anemia. You're more likely to get gallstones if: You're obese. This is one of the biggest risk factors. Obesity can raise your cholesterol level and also make it harder for the gallbladder to empty completely. You take birth control pills, hormone replacement therapy for menopause symptoms, or are pregnant. The extra estrogen is the problem. It can increase cholesterol and make it harder for the gallbladder to empty. You have diabetes. People with this condition tend to have higher levels of triglycerides (a type of blood fat), which is a risk factor for gallstones. You take medicine to lower your cholesterol. Some of these drugs boost the amount of cholesterol in bile, which may increase your chances of getting cholesterol stones. You lost weight too quickly. Your liver makes extra cholesterol, which may lead to gallstones. You're fasting. Your gallbladder may not squeeze as much.

This is called advanced breast cancer. You may also hear it called metastatic or stage IV disease. Although it's in other areas, it's still breast cancer and doctors treat it with breast cancer drugs. Advanced breast cancer mainly affects women, but men can get it, too. For anyone, it can turn life upside down. There's no cure for the disease, but there are treatments that can control it. And new therapies can help you feel better and often live longer. Doctors think this happens because cancer cells spread to other organs through the blood or lymph system. Some people with advanced breast cancer may not have symptoms, but many do. The ones you have depend on the size of your tumor and where it has spread in your body. Cancer in your bones can be painful and cause fractures. Tumors in your lungs can make it harder to breathe. Treatments can help relieve these problems. For instance, you can take drugs to make your bones stronger. For other types of breast cancer, where tumors are only in the breast, surgery is the main way to fight the disease. But once cancer has spread, the most common treatments are ones that travel through your blood to treat your whole body. These include hormones that shrink tumors, chemotherapy and medicines that target certain types of cancer cells. Chemo shrinks tumors faster than hormones, but it has more side effects and may stop working after a while. Some people may choose to have a few different types of chemotherapy over time.

If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other things that make you more likely to get heart disease, your doctor may want to keep a check on your triglyceride levels. Like cholesterol, triglycerides are a type of fat, or lipid, in your blood. Too much triglyceride can raise your chance of heart disease or cause sudden pancreatitis. Just as you can have high cholesterol without knowing, you may not have any symptoms of high triglyceride levels. So your doctor will often check them regularly, especially if you: Smoke Are overweight or obese Don't exercise Have high blood pressure Had a heart attack or have heart disease Have diabetes or prediabetes, thyroid disease, or kidney disease A blood test called a lipid panel checks both your triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Usually, your doctor will ask that you fast, or not eat or drink anything other than water, for 9-12 hours before the test. You'll get blood drawn from a vein in your arm.

54,155,"['https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-1-diabetes\nType 1 diabetes happens when your immune system destroys cells in your pancreas called beta cells. They\'re the ones that make insulin. Some people get a condition called secondary diabetes. It\'s similar to type 1, except the immune system doesn\'t destroy your beta cells. They\'re wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body\'s tissues. Cells use it as fuel. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Glucose doesn\'t move into your cells because insulin isn\'t there to do it. Instead it builds up in your blood and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar, which can lead to: Dehydration. When there\'s extra sugar in your blood, you pee more. That\'s your body\'s way of getting rid of it. A large amount of water goes out with that urine, causing your body to dry out. Weight loss. The glucose that goes out when you pee takes calories with it. That\'s why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. Dehydration also plays a part. Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA). If your body can\'t get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body can\'t use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This combination of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as ""ketoacidosis"" and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Damage to your body. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes, kidneys, and heart. They can also make you more likely to get hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. It\'s rare. Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. It\'s more common in whites than in African- Americans. It affects men and women equally. Although the disease usually starts in people under 20, it can happen at any age. Doctors don\'t know all the things that lead to type 1 diabetes. But they do know your genes play a role. They also know type 1 diabetes can result when something in the environment, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas. Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They\'re present in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases, like Grave\'s disease or vitiligo. These are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Heavy thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Nausea and vomiting Pain in your belly Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss (even though you\'re eating and feel hungry) Fatigue (weak, tired feeling) Blurred vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor will call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of the skin, urinary tract, or vagina Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Pain in your belly Loss of consciousness (rare) If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, he\'ll check your blood sugar levels. He may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don\'t have enough insulin. Right now there\'s no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Many people with type 1 diabetes live long, healthy lives. \x1b[92m[1] The key to good health is to keep your blood sugar levels within the range your doctor gives you\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] You\'ll need to check them often and adjust insulin, food, and activities to make that happen\x1b[0m. All people with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, he\'ll mention three main things: "" Onset"" is the length of time before it reaches your bloodstream and begins lowering blood sugar. "" Peak time"" is the time when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering blood sugar. "" Duration"" is how long it keeps working after onset. Several types of insulin are available. Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks around 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps working for 3 to 6 hours. Intermediate-acting won\'t get into your bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after injection. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours and works for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts for about 24 hours. Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two different types of insulin. You may progress to three or four shots a day. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end, and give yourself the shot. Some now comes in a prefilled pen. One kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump -- a device you wear that sends it into your body via a small tube. Your doctor will help you to pick the type and the delivery method that\'s best for you. Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn\'t as simple as going out for a run. You have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Knowledge is power. \x1b[92m[3] Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you\x1b[0m. Some things will make your levels go up; others won\'t. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to prevent it from dropping too low. \x1b[92m[4] If your test is high, test for ketones -- acids that can result from high sugar levels\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] If they\'re OK, you should be good to go\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] If they\'re high, skip the workout\x1b[0m. You\'ll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started. If you don\'t keep your type 1 diabetes well controlled, you could set yourself up for serious or life-threatening problems: Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. It\'s rare before puberty no matter how long you\'ve had the disease. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Kidney damage. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chances grow over time. It\'s most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems like kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood circulation and nerve damage. Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of sensation in and a lack of blood supply to your feet. This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. And when that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.']",When should I check my blood sugar if I have type 1 diabetes?,"[92m""The key to good health is to keep your blood sugar levels within the range your doctor gives you"" [1][0m. [92m""You'll need to check them often and adjust insulin, food, and activities to make that happen"" [2][0m. [92m""Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you"" [3][0m. [92m""If your test is high, test for ketones -- acids that can result from high sugar levels"" [4][0m. [92m""If they're OK, you should be good to go"" [5][0m. [92m""If they're high, skip the workout"" [6][0m.","""The key to good health is to keep your blood sugar levels within the range your doctor gives you.

They\'re the ones that make insulin. Some people get a condition called secondary diabetes. It\'s similar to type 1, except the immune system doesn\'t destroy your beta cells. They\'re wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body\'s tissues. Cells use it as fuel. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Glucose doesn\'t move into your cells because insulin isn\'t there to do it. Instead it builds up in your blood and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar, which can lead to: Dehydration. When there\'s extra sugar in your blood, you pee more. That\'s your body\'s way of getting rid of it. A large amount of water goes out with that urine, causing your body to dry out. Weight loss. The glucose that goes out when you pee takes calories with it. That\'s why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. Dehydration also plays a part. Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA). If your body can\'t get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body can\'t use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This combination of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as ""ketoacidosis"" and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Damage to your body. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes, kidneys, and heart. They can also make you more likely to get hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. It\'s rare. Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. It\'s more common in whites than in African- Americans. It affects men and women equally. Although the disease usually starts in people under 20, it can happen at any age. Doctors don\'t know all the things that lead to type 1 diabetes. But they do know your genes play a role. They also know type 1 diabetes can result when something in the environment, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas. Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They\'re present in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases, like Grave\'s disease or vitiligo. These are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Heavy thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Nausea and vomiting Pain in your belly Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss (even though you\'re eating and feel hungry) Fatigue (weak, tired feeling) Blurred vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor will call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of the skin, urinary tract, or vagina Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Pain in your belly Loss of consciousness (rare) If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, he\'ll check your blood sugar levels. He may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don\'t have enough insulin. Right now there\'s no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Many people with type 1 diabetes live long, healthy lives. The key to good health is to keep your blood sugar levels within the range your doctor gives you. You\'ll need to check them often and adjust insulin, food, and activities to make that happen. All people with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, he\'ll mention three main things: "" Onset"" is the length of time before it reaches your bloodstream and begins lowering blood sugar. "" Peak time"" is the time when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering blood sugar. "" Duration"" is how long it keeps working after onset. Several types of insulin are available. Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks around 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps working for 3 to 6 hours. Intermediate-acting won\'t get into your bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after injection. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours and works for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts for about 24 hours. Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two different types of insulin. You may progress to three or four shots a day. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end, and give yourself the shot. Some now comes in a prefilled pen. One kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump -- a device you wear that sends it into your body via a small tube. Your doctor will help you to pick the type and the delivery method that\'s best for you. Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn\'t as simple as going out for a run. You have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Knowledge is power. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you. Some things will make your levels go up; others won\'t. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to prevent it from dropping too low. If your test is high, test for ketones -- acids that can result from high sugar levels. If they\'re OK, you should be good to go. If they\'re high, skip the workout. You\'ll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started. If you don\'t keep your type 1 diabetes well controlled, you could set yourself up for serious or life-threatening problems: Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. It\'s rare before puberty no matter how long you\'ve had the disease. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Kidney damage. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chances grow over time. It\'s most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems like kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood circulation and nerve damage.

56,81,"[""https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adhd-ways-to-tell\nHas anyone ever asked you if you have ADHD? Maybe you've even wondered yourself. The only way to know for sure is to see a doctor. That's because the disorder has a number of possible symptoms, and they can easily be confused with those of other conditions, like depression or anxiety. Not sure whether you should get checked by a doc? If many of these apply, you may need to get checked out. 1. \x1b[92m[1] People say you're forgetful\x1b[0m. Everyone misplaces car keys or jackets once in a while. But this kind of thing happens often when you have ADHD. You might spend time looking for glasses, wallets, phones, and other items every day. You may also forget to return phone calls, space out on paying bills, or miss medical appointments. 2. \x1b[92m[2] People complain that you don't listen\x1b[0m. Most of us lose focus on a conversation once in a while, especially if there's a TV nearby or something else grabs our attention. This happens often and to a greater degree with ADHD, even when there are no distractions around. But still, ADHD is more than that. 3. \x1b[92m[3] You're often late\x1b[0m. Time management is an ongoing challenge when you have ADHD. It often leads to missed deadlines or appointments unless you work on avoiding that. 4. \x1b[92m[4] You have trouble concentrating\x1b[0m. Problems with attention, especially focusing for long periods of time or paying attention to details, is one of the hallmarks of the condition. Depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders can also take a toll on your focus, and many people with ADHD have one or more of these issues, too. Your doctor can ask you questions to get to the bottom of what's causing your attention problems. 5. \x1b[92m[5] You leave things undone\x1b[0m. Problems with attention and memory can make it tough to start or finish projects, especially ones that you know will take a lot of focus to complete. This symptom can point to depression, too. 6. \x1b[92m[6] You had behavior issues as a child\x1b[0m. You need to have had attention and concentration problems as a child in order to be diagnosed with ADHD as an adult -- even if those early symptoms didn't come with a formal diagnosis. People may have accused you of being lazy back in childhood. Or they may have thought you had another condition like depression or anxiety. If you actually were diagnosed with the disorder as a child, you may still have it. The symptoms change as you age, and not everyone outgrows it. 7. \x1b[92m[7] You lack impulse control\x1b[0m. This is more than tossing a candy bar into your cart at the checkout line. This is doing something even though you know it could have serious consequences, like running a red light because you think you can get away with it or not being able to keep quiet when you have something to say, even though you know you should. 8. \x1b[92m[8] You can't get organized\x1b[0m. You may notice this more at work. You could have trouble setting priorities, following through on tasks, and meeting project deadlines. 9. \x1b[92m[9] You're fidgety\x1b[0m. Kids with ADHD are often hyperactive, but adults are more likely to be fidgety or restless. You might also talk too much and interrupt others. 10. \x1b[92m[10] You can't control your emotions\x1b[0m. You might be moody or irritable, express frustration often, feel unmotivated, or be prone to angry outbursts. ADHD can make it hard to manage uncomfortable emotions or follow appropriate behavior when you're upset. There's no one test. Instead, \x1b[92m[11] doctors and psychologists get information about what and how many symptoms you have, when they started, how long they've lasted, and how severe they are\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[12] In order to be diagnosed with ADHD, you need to have several symptoms, not just one or two\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[13] And they have to have affected your jobs, relationships, or other important areas of your life\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[14] Your doctor will also want to rule out other conditions or find out if you have more than one disorder\x1b[0m. Several treatments can help you manage the condition. So if you answered yes to a lot of these questions, consider making an appointment with your doctor.

Maybe you've even wondered yourself. The only way to know for sure is to see a doctor. That's because the disorder has a number of possible symptoms, and they can easily be confused with those of other conditions, like depression or anxiety. Not sure whether you should get checked by a doc? If many of these apply, you may need to get checked out. 1. People say you're forgetful. Everyone misplaces car keys or jackets once in a while. But this kind of thing happens often when you have ADHD. You might spend time looking for glasses, wallets, phones, and other items every day. You may also forget to return phone calls, space out on paying bills, or miss medical appointments. 2. People complain that you don't listen. Most of us lose focus on a conversation once in a while, especially if there's a TV nearby or something else grabs our attention. This happens often and to a greater degree with ADHD, even when there are no distractions around. But still, ADHD is more than that. 3. You're often late. Time management is an ongoing challenge when you have ADHD. It often leads to missed deadlines or appointments unless you work on avoiding that. 4. You have trouble concentrating. Problems with attention, especially focusing for long periods of time or paying attention to details, is one of the hallmarks of the condition. Depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders can also take a toll on your focus, and many people with ADHD have one or more of these issues, too. Your doctor can ask you questions to get to the bottom of what's causing your attention problems. 5. You leave things undone. Problems with attention and memory can make it tough to start or finish projects, especially ones that you know will take a lot of focus to complete. This symptom can point to depression, too. 6. You had behavior issues as a child. You need to have had attention and concentration problems as a child in order to be diagnosed with ADHD as an adult -- even if those early symptoms didn't come with a formal diagnosis.

If that happens, he'll follow up with other tests to confirm you have the disease. Some doctors say you should get tested at least once no matter what. Definitely get screened if any of these things apply to you: Were born between 1945 and 1965 Currently using or injecting drugs Ever injected drugs -- even if it was just once or a long time ago Have HIV Are on kidney dialysis Have abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels ( ALT) Had a blood transfusion, blood components, or an organ transplant before July 1992 Got clotting factor concentrates made before 1987 Received blood from a donor who later tested positive for hepatitis C virus ( HCV) Health care workers, first responders, and other whose work exposes them to HCV-infected needles Children born to women with HCV You can have hep C with no symptoms. The test is quick and easy. You'll protect family and friends. Treatment can suppress the virus and maybe even cure you. Early treatment prevents cirrhosis and liver failure. \x1b[92m[3] Doctors will start by checking your blood for: Anti- HCV antibodies: These are proteins your body makes when it finds the hep C virus in your bloo\x1b[0md. They usually show up about 12 weeks after infection. How long does it take to get results? It usually takes a few days to a week to get results, though a rapid test is available in some places. What do the results mean? Non- Reactive or negative: You don't have hep C. If you've been exposed in the last 6 months, you'll need to be retested. Reactive or positive: You have hep C antibodies, and you've been infected at some point. You'll need another test to make sure. \x1b[92m[4] If your antibody test is positive, you'll get this test: RNA: It measures the number of viral RNA (genetic material from the hepatitis virus) particles in your blood\x1b[0m. Your doctor might refer to this as your viral load. They usually show up 1-2 weeks after you're infected. What do the results mean? Negative: You don't have hep C. Positive: You have hep C. \x1b[92m[5] As part of the diagnosis process, you might also get: Liver function tests: They measure proteins and enzymes levels, which usually rise 7 to 8 weeks after you're infected\x1b[0m. As your liver gets damaged, enzymes leak into your bloodstream. But you can have normal enzyme levels and still have hepatitis C. Once the doctor knows you have hep C, he'll do tests to find out more about your condition. They could include: \x1b[92m[6] Genotype tests to find out which of the six kinds (genotypes) of hepatitis C you have\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Tests to check for liver damage\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] You might get: Elastography: Doctors use a special ultrasound machine to feel how stiff your liver is\x1b[0m. Liver biopsy: The doctor inserts a needle into your liver to take a tiny piece to examine in the lab. Imaging tests: These use various methods to take pictures or show images of your insides. They include: CT scan Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) Magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE) Ultrasound Liver function tests ( LFTs) or liver enzyme tests: These blood tests help the doctor know how well your liver is working These test results will help the doctor decide which treatment is right for you.

When you're caring for someone with the condition, there are simple ways you can make eating healthier, easier, and more enjoyable. The basic rules of a healthy diet apply to everyone, whether they have Alzheimer's or not. Build a meal plan that helps your loved one: Eat a variety of foods, especially fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Keep a healthy weight. Proper portion sizes and exercise are a key part of this, too. Limit foods with high saturated fat and cholesterol, like fatty meats and fried foods. Cut down on sugar. Avoid eating too much salt. Drink plenty of water. Ask your loved one's health care team if there are any foods or drinks that can keep the medicines she takes from working. Also check if any of the meds affect her appetite, bowel movements, or cause other problems that can affect her nutrition. \x1b[92m[8] Her doctor may be able to change the dose or suggest another drug that will ease side effects\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[1] Some Alzheimer's medications can cause constipation\x1b[0m. It can also happen \x1b[92m[2] if someone doesn't eat or drink enough\x1b[0m. Make sure your loved one: \x1b[92m[3] Gets plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in her diet\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] These are great sources of fiber, which can help curb constipation\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Drinks enough water and other fluids\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Stays active\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Exercise can help get things moving in the bathroom, too\x1b[0m. Someone with Alzheimer's may not drink enough water because her body's signal for thirst isn't as strong as it was. Some medicines can dry out her mouth, too. Remind your loved one to drink water, and try other ways to avoid dry mouth: Dunk breads, toast, cookies, or crackers in milk, hot chocolate, or tea to soften them. Remind her to take a drink after each bite of food to moisten her mouth and help her swallow. Add broth or sauces to foods to make them softer and wetter. Offer sour candy or fruit ice to help her mouth make more saliva. People with Alzheimer's may feel less hungry or thirsty, have problems chewing or swallowing, have trouble using utensils or feeding themselves, or make bad food choices. This raises the chance that they won't eat enough and will lose too much weight. To help your loved one keep up her weight and get the right nutrients: Offer smaller meals or snacks more often. Eating five or six times a day may be easier than getting the same amount of food in three meals. Give her a daily multivitamin. Help her focus on the more nutritious, higher-calorie foods in the meal first. Prepare things that are easy to eat. Good options are bite-sized finger foods, like chicken nuggets, tuna sandwiches, orange slices, and steamed broccoli. Make meals enjoyable. If lunch or dinner is a social event, she may look forward to it and eat better. Trouble chewing or swallowing could be a choking risk, so talk to her doctor if she has a hard time. He can recommend a special diet or foods that are easier to eat. Use utensils or dishes that are easier to handle. A spoon and bowl may be betterthan a fork and plate. Exercise can boost appetite. Encourage your loved one to take walks, garden, or do simple chores to stay active. Not feeling hungry and weight changes can also be signs of depression. Talk to her doctor if you think this might be a problem. If you need help building a meal plan, a dietitian can help you find ways to make eating healthy and easy for your loved one.

59,118,"['https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/what-is-acne\nIf there\'s one thing you can count on as a teen, it\'s acne. More than 85% of teenagers have this common skin problem, which is marked by clogged pores (whiteheads, blackheads), painful pimples, and, sometimes, hard, deep lumps on the face, neck, shoulders, chest, back, and upper arms. If your mom and dad had acne, chances are good that you will, too. But there are many ways to prevent (and treat) acne today to keep the condition minimal, prevent scarring, and leave your skin glowing. To understand acne, you need to know how your skin works. The pores in your skin contain oil glands. When you hit puberty, there\'s an increase in sex hormones called androgens. The excess hormones cause your oil glands to become overactive, enlarge, and produce too much oil, or sebum. When there\'s too much sebum, the pores or hair follicles become blocked with skin cells. The increase in oil also results in an overgrowth of bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes. If blocked pores become infected or inflamed, a pimple -- a raised red spot with a white center -- forms. If the pore clogs, closes, and then bulges, you have a whitehead. A blackhead occurs when the pore clogs, stays open, and the top has a blackish appearance due to oxidation or exposure to air. ( This has nothing to do with skin being ""dirty""). \x1b[92m[1] When bacteria grow in the blocked pore, a pustule may appear, meaning the pimple becomes red and inflamed\x1b[0m. Cysts form \x1b[92m[3] when the blockage and inflammation deep inside pores produce large, painful lumps beneath the skin\'s surface\x1b[0m. Hormonal changes related to birth control pills, menstrual periods, and pregnancy can trigger acne. Other external acne triggers include heavy face creams and cosmetics, hair dyes, and greasy hair ointment -- all of which can increase blockage of pores. Clothing that rubs your skin may also worsen acne, especially on the back and chest. So can heavy sweating during exercise, and hot, humid climates. Stress is known to trigger increased oil production, which is why many teens have a new crop of pimples on the first day of school or just before that big date. While the symptoms of acne vary in severity, you\'ll notice these signs on areas of your body with the most oil glands (the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms): Clogged pores (pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads) Papules (raised lesions) Pustules (raised lesions with pus) Cysts (nodules filled with pus or fluid) The least severe type of acne lesion is the whitehead or blackhead. This type is also the most easily treated. With more extensive acne, you may need prescription medications to ease inflammation, bacterial infection, redness, and pus. The treatment usually depends on how serious the problem is. For instance, if you have an occasional inflamed pimple, you may use skin compounds containing: Azelaic acid Benzoyl peroxide Glycolic acid Lactic acid Retinoids (medications that come from vitamin A) Salicylic acid Various fruit acids Benzoyl peroxide reduces oil production and has antibacterial properties. But use it carefully, as it might leave your skin dry and flaky. ( It can also bleach out clothing, towels and bedsheets.) Try to use it just before bedtime. \x1b[92m[2] Resorcinol and sulfur, as well as prescription retinoids and prescription antibiotics applied to skin, can reduce blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed pustules\x1b[0m. When many pustules or cysts appear on the face and upper body, you\'ll need an oral antibiotic. \x1b[92m[4] Your doctor also can inject cysts with anti-inflammatory steroid solutions to help decrease their size\x1b[0m. For persistent acne, antibiotics (taken by mouth or applied to the skin) are generally used. Some antibiotics have both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. These are often prescribed for short-term use (usually a few months). Because acne is linked to hormones, some oral contraceptives (birth control pills) may help. But not all birth control pills stop acne, and some make it worse. Spironolactone, a hormone blocker, can be used for teenage girls who have acne. \x1b[92m[5] Isotretinoin, a prescription medication you take orally, may help control severe acne, which is characterized by many large cysts on the face, neck, and upper trunk and scarring\x1b[0m. Pregnant women or women who might become pregnant can\'t use this medication, as it\'s linked to birth defects. Isotretinoin can give people very dry skin, eye dryness, and irritation and requires blood tests to monitor for liver inflammation, high blood fat content, and bone marrow suppression. It can also be very expensive. So its use is restricted to the most severe cases for which other treatments haven\'t worked. There are some steps you can take to prevent acne. To prevent oily skin that can contribute to acne, keep your skin clean. Wash your face and neck twice daily with mild soap and warm water. But never scrub your face! That can irritate your skin and worsen acne. Whether you have a few pimples or more serious acne, talk to your primary health care provider about treatments. Treating acne early is the key to avoiding permanent scarring.']",How do you treat pustules or cysts?,"Pustules are described as [92m""when bacteria grow in the blocked pore, a pustule may appear, meaning the pimple becomes red and inflamed"" [1][0m.

( This has nothing to do with skin being ""dirty""). \x1b[92m[1] When bacteria grow in the blocked pore, a pustule may appear, meaning the pimple becomes red and inflamed\x1b[0m. Cysts form \x1b[92m[3] when the blockage and inflammation deep inside pores produce large, painful lumps beneath the skin\'s surface\x1b[0m. Hormonal changes related to birth control pills, menstrual periods, and pregnancy can trigger acne. Other external acne triggers include heavy face creams and cosmetics, hair dyes, and greasy hair ointment -- all of which can increase blockage of pores. Clothing that rubs your skin may also worsen acne, especially on the back and chest. So can heavy sweating during exercise, and hot, humid climates. Stress is known to trigger increased oil production, which is why many teens have a new crop of pimples on the first day of school or just before that big date. While the symptoms of acne vary in severity, you\'ll notice these signs on areas of your body with the most oil glands (the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms): Clogged pores (pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads) Papules (raised lesions) Pustules (raised lesions with pus) Cysts (nodules filled with pus or fluid) The least severe type of acne lesion is the whitehead or blackhead. This type is also the most easily treated. With more extensive acne, you may need prescription medications to ease inflammation, bacterial infection, redness, and pus. The treatment usually depends on how serious the problem is. For instance, if you have an occasional inflamed pimple, you may use skin compounds containing: Azelaic acid Benzoyl peroxide Glycolic acid Lactic acid Retinoids (medications that come from vitamin A) Salicylic acid Various fruit acids Benzoyl peroxide reduces oil production and has antibacterial properties. But use it carefully, as it might leave your skin dry and flaky. ( It can also bleach out clothing, towels and bedsheets.) Try to use it just before bedtime. \x1b[92m[2] Resorcinol and sulfur, as well as prescription retinoids and prescription antibiotics applied to skin, can reduce blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed pustules\x1b[0m. When many pustules or cysts appear on the face and upper body, you\'ll need an oral antibiotic. \x1b[92m[4] Your doctor also can inject cysts with anti-inflammatory steroid solutions to help decrease their size\x1b[0m. For persistent acne, antibiotics (taken by mouth or applied to the skin) are generally used. Some antibiotics have both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. These are often prescribed for short-term use (usually a few months). Because acne is linked to hormones, some oral contraceptives (birth control pills) may help. But not all birth control pills stop acne, and some make it worse. Spironolactone, a hormone blocker, can be used for teenage girls who have acne. \x1b[92m[5] Isotretinoin, a prescription medication you take orally, may help control severe acne, which is characterized by many large cysts on the face, neck, and upper trunk and scarring\x1b[0m. Pregnant women or women who might become pregnant can\'t use this medication, as it\'s linked to birth defects. Isotretinoin can give people very dry skin, eye dryness, and irritation and requires blood tests to monitor for liver inflammation, high blood fat content, and bone marrow suppression. It can also be very expensive. So its use is restricted to the most severe cases for which other treatments haven\'t worked. There are some steps you can take to prevent acne. To prevent oily skin that can contribute to acne, keep your skin clean. Wash your face and neck twice daily with mild soap and warm water. But never scrub your face! That can irritate your skin and worsen acne. Whether you have a few pimples or more serious acne, talk to your primary health care provider about treatments. Treating acne early is the key to avoiding permanent scarring.']",6BBinbmBretqjJt,"[10.0788474082947,12.9169030189514,12.8262734413147,23.4903125762939]",2024-09-06 20:58:15.559754+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2},{""annotations"":[1,1],""sentence_id"":3}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":3}]","[True, True, True, True]",1,2

Your doctor may want to put you on medications to control your infection and speed up healing, cut inflammation, and ease your pain. They include: These medicines may slow down the progress of the shingles rash, especially if you take them within the first 72 hours of having symptoms. They can also lower your chance of having complications. Your doctor may prescribe: Acyclovir ( Zovirax) Famciclovir ( Famvir) Valacyclovir ( Valtrex) Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about side effects to watch for if you're put on one these. Shingles causes inflammation and pain. Your doctor can suggest over-the-counter medicines to relieve milder discomfort. They include: Acetaminophen Ibuprofen Naproxen These may also help you stave off postherpetic neuralgia, which is a burning pain that some people get after the rash and blisters of shingles go away. If you have severe pain after the rash clears or an infection during your shingles outbreak, your doctor might prescribe: Capsaicin cream: Be careful not to get it in your eyes. A numbing medicine: You might get lidocaine ( Lidoderm, Xylocaine) for pain. It can come in a variety of forms, such as creams, lotions, patches, powders, and sprays, among others. Antibiotics : You might need these medicines if bacteria infect your skin and rashes. But if bacteria aren't involved, then antibiotics won't help. Tricyclic antidepressants : There are many of these medications that might help ease the pain that lingers after your skin has healed, such as amitriptyline, desipramine ( Norpramin), and nortriptyline ( Aventyl, Pamelor). They may also help you with depression, if you have that in addition to shingles. Your doctor can tell you what the risks and benefits are. There aren't home remedies for shingles. But there are things you can do to help your skin heal. Keep the affected area clean, dry, and exposed to air as much as possible. The itching can be maddening at times, but try not to scratch or burst the blisters. Ask your doctor about creams and other things you can try to give yourself some relief. Some people find that acupuncture and other complementary treatments help with the pain that can linger after shingles. Let your doctor know first if you want to try these. There are two shingles vaccines. Shingrix ( RZV) is recommended over the older vaccine, Zostavax, because it is more than 90% effective in preventing a shingles outbreak Who should get it: \x1b[92m[1] The CDC recommends that you get this vaccine if you're 50 or older whether or not you remember having had chickenpox, because most people have been exposed to the virus\x1b[0m. If you have had the Zostavax vaccine, you can also have Shingrix. How many shots do you need? You would need two shots for Shingrix. One initially, with a follow up in 6 months. What it does: Shingrix reduces your chance of getting shingles by more than 90%. Even if you still get shingles, the vaccine may help it be less painful. I never had chickenpox. Do I still need the shingles vaccine? \x1b[92m[2] Yes, you do\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Shingrix is recommended for everyone age 50 and older, whether or not you remember having had chickenpox\x1b[0m. If I've had shingles, can I still get the vaccine? Yes. It may help prevent you having another bout of shingles later on. If you have shingles right now, you should wait until the rash is gone before you get vaccinated. What are the side effects? The most common side effects with Shingrix include pain and swelling where you got the shot, muscle pain, tiredness, headache, chills, fever, and stomach troubles. With any vaccine there is a chance of a severe allergic reaction. Also since Zostavax is a live virus vaccine, it is also possible to get a small chicken-pox like rash around the spot where you got the shot. Don't get the Shingrix vaccine if: You're allergic to any of the ingredients. You have a weak immune system, either because of a condition or due to certain medicines. You're pregnant or nursing. You have tested negative for immunity to the chicken pox virus. Ask your doctor about the chicken pox vaccine instead. You have shingles now.

61,190,"['https://www.webmd.com/brain/essential-tremor-basics\nEssential Tremor is a nerve disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking, or ""tremors,"" in different parts and on different sides of the body. Areas affected often include the hands, arms, head, larynx (voice box), tongue, and chin. The lower body is rarely affected. ET is not a life-threatening disorder, unless it prevents a person from caring for him or herself. Most people are able to live normal lives with this condition -- although they may find everyday activities like eating, dressing, or writing difficult. It is only when the tremors become severe that they actually cause disability. The true cause of Essential Tremor is still not understood, but it is thought that the abnormal electrical brain activity that causes tremor is processed through the thalamus. The thalamus is a structure deep in the brain that coordinates and controls muscle activity. Genetics is responsible for causing ET in half of all people with the condition. A child born to a parent with ET will have up to a 50% chance of inheriting the responsible gene, but may never actually experience symptoms. Although ET is more common in the elderly -- and symptoms become more pronounced with age -- it is not a part of the natural aging process. Essential Tremor is the most common movement disorder, affecting up to 10 million people in the U. S. While ET can occur at any age, it most often strikes for the first time during adolescence or in middle age (between ages 40 and 50). The primary symptoms associated with essential tremor include: Uncontrollable shaking that occurs for brief periods of time Shaking voice Nodding head Tremors that worsen during periods of emotional stress Tremors that get worse with purposeful movement Tremors that lessen with rest Balance problems (in rare cases) The uncontrollable shaking associated with ET is not unique to this condition. Many different factors or diseases can also cause tremors, including Parkinson\'s disease, multiple sclerosis, fatigue after exercise, extreme emotional distress, brain tumors, some prescription drugs, metabolic abnormalities, and alcohol or drug withdrawal. Essential Tremor is linked to other illnesses. Other movement disorders, such as Parkinson\'s disease, have been associated with ET. Some reports have also linked ET with migraine headaches. People with ET may also be at a high risks of developing dementia (particularly Alzheimer\'s disease) . Drugs used to treat Essential Tremor may also increase a person\'s risk of becoming depressed. Some experts also feel that there is no increased risk for Parkinson\'s disease for people with ET. Instead, some people diagnosed as having ET are initially incorrectly diagnosed and subsequently turn out to have Parkinson\'s disease. A neurologist or movement disorder specialist can usually diagnose Essential Tremor based on reported symptoms and a complete neurological exam. There is no specific blood, urine, or other test used to diagnose ET. As part of the exam, your health care provider may consider other causes of tremor, such as thyroid disease, excessive caffeine intake, or medication side effects. Mild essential tremor may not require treatment. However, if ET interferes with your ability to function or if you find it socially unacceptable, there are treatments that may improve symptoms. Treatments may include medications or surgery. Medications: Oral drugs can significantly reduce the severity of essential tremor. Medications include propranolol ( Inderal), primidone ( Mysoline), gabapentin ( Neurontin), and topiramate ( Topamax). Other drug options include the benzodiazepines lorazepam ( Ativan), clonazepam ( Klonopin), diazepam ( Valium), and alprazolam ( Xanax). Botox injections may also be a treatment option. This treatment has been effective for vocal and head tremors. Surgery: Deep brain stimulation ( DBS) is a surgical treatment option for people with severe tremor despite medical therapy. DBS involves surgical implantation of electrical leads into the thalamus. This is an area deep within the brain that coordinates muscle control that is thought to be affected in ET. MRI-guided Focused High Intensity Ultrasound: Neuravive uses magnetic resonance images ( MRI) to focus ultrasound to destroy tissue in the thalamus.

Areas affected often include the hands, arms, head, larynx (voice box), tongue, and chin. The lower body is rarely affected. ET is not a life-threatening disorder, unless it prevents a person from caring for him or herself. Most people are able to live normal lives with this condition -- although they may find everyday activities like eating, dressing, or writing difficult. It is only when the tremors become severe that they actually cause disability. The true cause of Essential Tremor is still not understood, but it is thought that the abnormal electrical brain activity that causes tremor is processed through the thalamus. The thalamus is a structure deep in the brain that coordinates and controls muscle activity. Genetics is responsible for causing ET in half of all people with the condition. A child born to a parent with ET will have up to a 50% chance of inheriting the responsible gene, but may never actually experience symptoms. Although ET is more common in the elderly -- and symptoms become more pronounced with age -- it is not a part of the natural aging process. Essential Tremor is the most common movement disorder, affecting up to 10 million people in the U. S. While ET can occur at any age, it most often strikes for the first time during adolescence or in middle age (between ages 40 and 50). The primary symptoms associated with essential tremor include: Uncontrollable shaking that occurs for brief periods of time Shaking voice Nodding head Tremors that worsen during periods of emotional stress Tremors that get worse with purposeful movement Tremors that lessen with rest Balance problems (in rare cases) The uncontrollable shaking associated with ET is not unique to this condition. Many different factors or diseases can also cause tremors, including Parkinson\'s disease, multiple sclerosis, fatigue after exercise, extreme emotional distress, brain tumors, some prescription drugs, metabolic abnormalities, and alcohol or drug withdrawal. Essential Tremor is linked to other illnesses. Other movement disorders, such as Parkinson\'s disease, have been associated with ET. Some reports have also linked ET with migraine headaches. People with ET may also be at a high risks of developing dementia (particularly Alzheimer\'s disease) . Drugs used to treat Essential Tremor may also increase a person\'s risk of becoming depressed. Some experts also feel that there is no increased risk for Parkinson\'s disease for people with ET. Instead, some people diagnosed as having ET are initially incorrectly diagnosed and subsequently turn out to have Parkinson\'s disease. A neurologist or movement disorder specialist can usually diagnose Essential Tremor based on reported symptoms and a complete neurological exam. There is no specific blood, urine, or other test used to diagnose ET. As part of the exam, your health care provider may consider other causes of tremor, such as thyroid disease, excessive caffeine intake, or medication side effects. Mild essential tremor may not require treatment. However, if ET interferes with your ability to function or if you find it socially unacceptable, there are treatments that may improve symptoms. Treatments may include medications or surgery. Medications: Oral drugs can significantly reduce the severity of essential tremor. Medications include propranolol ( Inderal), primidone ( Mysoline), gabapentin ( Neurontin), and topiramate ( Topamax). Other drug options include the benzodiazepines lorazepam ( Ativan), clonazepam ( Klonopin), diazepam ( Valium), and alprazolam ( Xanax). Botox injections may also be a treatment option. This treatment has been effective for vocal and head tremors. Surgery: Deep brain stimulation ( DBS) is a surgical treatment option for people with severe tremor despite medical therapy. DBS involves surgical implantation of electrical leads into the thalamus. This is an area deep within the brain that coordinates muscle control that is thought to be affected in ET. MRI-guided Focused High Intensity Ultrasound: Neuravive uses magnetic resonance images ( MRI) to focus ultrasound to destroy tissue in the thalamus. Patients are awake and responsive during the entire treatment. \x1b[92m[1] Because we do not know the exact cause of Essential Tremor, there is currently no way to prevent it\x1b[0m. However, knowing that ET has a genetic link brings us further in the search for effective treatments and, ultimately, ways to prevent it.

For breast cancer treatment, it has three major purposes: \x1b[92m[1] To prevent cancer from coming back after surgery and radiation\x1b[0m. When chemotherapy is used this way, it's called adjuvant therapy. \x1b[92m[2] To shrink a tumor before surgery to make it easier to remove\x1b[0m. This is called neo-adjuvant therapy. \x1b[92m[3] To kill cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body\x1b[0m. Together, you and your doctor will decide when to start chemotherapy, what drugs to use, and a schedule for taking them. Ask what side effects you can expect from the medication. Chemotherapy drugs used to treat early breast cancer include: Anthracyclines: This class of drugs includes doxorubicin ( Adriamycin) and epirubicin ( Ellence). Taxanes: This class of drugs includes docetaxel ( Taxotere) and paclitaxel ( Taxol). These drugs are often used with others like carboplatin, cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan), and fluorouracil (5- FU). Drugs used to treat advanced breast cancer include: Albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel or Abraxane) Capecitabine ( Xeloda) Eribulin ( Halaven) Gemcitabine ( Gemzar) Ixabepilone ( Ixempra) Liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil) Mitoxantrone Platinum (carboplatin, cisplatin) Vinorelbine ( Navelbine) Your doctor will probably talk to you about combining different chemo drugs. They may refer to them by abbreviations for their names. Some of the most common include: AC: Adriamycin and Cytoxan AT: Adriamycin and Taxotere CMF: Cytoxan, methotrexate, and fluorouracil FAC: Fluorouracil, Adriamycin, and Cytoxan CAF: Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and fluorouracil ( FAC and CAF use the same medicines but in different doses and frequencies) You get chemotherapy \x1b[92m[5] as a pill or in a vein daily, weekly, or every 2-4 weeks\x1b[0m.

These devices are inserted by a surgeon or radiologist and have an opening to the skin or a port under the skin, allowing chemotherapy medications to be given. They can also be used to give fluids or take blood samples. \x1b[92m[7] Once chemotherapy is finished, your catheter will be removed\x1b[0m. Your doctor will check you regularly to see how your body is handling the chemotherapy. They'll do regular blood tests to count the number of blood cells you have. If you have too few red blood cells, you may get a blood transfusion. If you have too few white blood cells, you could get an injection. If you have too few platelets, which clot blood, you may need a platelet infusion. Your chemotherapy might be postponed until your blood cells or platelets recover. You may also get imaging scans to see how well the chemotherapy is working. Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells. But it also kills some healthy cells, causing side effects. Medicine can help you feel better. It's important to tell your doctor if you have any side effects, like: Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite Fatigue Mouth soreness Hair loss Weight gain Premature menopause. If you are planning to have children, tell your doctor before starting chemotherapy. Lowered resistance to infections Increased bleeding. If the platelet count is very low, little red spots may appear on your body. You may bruise or bleed easily.

63,144,"['https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/inguinal-hernia\nIf you feel a pain in your groin when you cough or lift something heavy, you may have what doctors call an inguinal hernia. It happens when a part of the small intestine or fat pushes through a weak area of your lower abdominal wall. This type of hernia is named for the inguinal canal. That\'s a passage in the lower abdominal wall that houses blood vessels and nerves, as well as the spermatic cord in boys and men, and ligaments that support the uterus in girls and women. An inguinal hernia could be a serious health problem, so you shouldn\'t ignore symptoms. A physical exam is usually all it takes to diagnose the problem. If the hernia is large enough, you\'ll need surgery to fix it. A baby can get an indirect inguinal hernia if the lining of their abdomen doesn\'t fully close while they\'re developing. What\'s left is an opening at the upper part of the inguinal canal. That\'s where a hernia can take shape. Older adults usually get a direct inguinal hernia because the muscles of their abdominal wall can weaken. Women rarely have this type of hernia. The broad ligament of the uterus is right behind the abdominal wall, which supports it and shields the inguinal canal. Men don\'t have that barrier, so stress and gradual weakening of their abdominal muscles over time make it more likely something can push through to the inguinal canal. It happens in 2% to 3% of male babies, but less than 1% of baby girls. About 1 in 4 males will have one at some time in their life. It\'s most common in men over the age of 40. Abdominal surgery can make you more likely to develop a direct inguinal hernia. A family history of this condition raises your odds, too. Smokers may have a higher chance of having inguinal hernias, as well as many other health problems. You can\'t prevent being born with a weaker abdominal wall. But you can take steps to avoid having problems because of it, such as not smoking and keeping your weight in check. If you have abdominal surgery, \x1b[92m[1] be careful afterward: Use your legs, not your back, when lifting\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Avoid lifting heavy things\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Try not to strain when you poop\x1b[0m. You could have a direct inguinal hernia if you: \x1b[92m[4] Hurt when you cough, bend, or lift something heavy\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[5] Feel pressure or weakness in your groin\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] Have swelling around your testicles\x1b[0m You may be able to gently push the bump back up into your abdomen to relieve some of the discomfort. See your doctor if you have symptoms of an inguinal hernia. Your doctor will check your groin area for swelling or a bulge. He\'ll probably ask you to stand and cough. This can make a hernia more obvious. If it hasn\'t produced any swelling that the doctor can see, he may order imaging tests, like an abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. In some cases, if your hernia isn\'t treated, you could develop a serious complication called ""strangulation."" It happens when the small intestine gets stuck in the inguinal canal and can\'t be moved or massaged back into the abdomen. As a result of being ""strangled,"" the intestines lose their blood supply. The affected part of the intestines can die. This is a major medical emergency. If you have an inguinal hernia and your belly hurts a lot, don\'t wait -- call 911. If you have an inguinal hernia, \x1b[92m[8] a high-fiber diet with plenty of veggies, fresh fruits, and whole grains\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[7] may help you avoid constipation\x1b[0m, which can lead to painful symptoms. Surgery can prevent strangulation, and it\'s the only way to fix an inguinal hernia. The doctor will push the bulging tissue back inside and strengthen your abdominal wall with stitches and perhaps mesh. She might be able to do this through a small cut in your belly using a special tool -- a procedure called laparoscopy -- which means you\'ll probably hurt less and heal faster than traditional surgery. An inguinal hernia can be quite painful, but it\'s definitely treatable. If you think you have one, see your doctor. It won\'t get better on its own.']",How do I recover from abdominal surgery to prevent inguinal hernia?,"After abdominal surgery, to prevent inguinal hernia, it's crucial to [92m""be careful afterward: Use your legs, not your back, when lifting"" [1][0m. [92m""Avoid lifting heavy things"" [2][0m. [92m""Try not to strain when you poop"" [3][0m.

Older adults usually get a direct inguinal hernia because the muscles of their abdominal wall can weaken. Women rarely have this type of hernia.

65,84,"[""https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/epi-expect\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI) causes serious problems with how you digest your food. Your pancreas makes enzymes that help break down the foods you eat so you can get nutrients, vitamins, and minerals from them. When you have EPI, \x1b[92m[2] your pancreas doesn't make enough of\x1b[0m these enzymes. To help you digest foods more easily, you can get treatments that replace them. Other treatments help you manage symptoms like stomach pain or acid. Supplements can give your body extra doses of important vitamins and minerals to keep your weight up so you stay healthy. You also can treat the health problem that causes your EPI, like cystic fibrosis, Shwachman- Diamond syndrome, or chronic pancreatitis. You may get chronic pancreatitis if you have alcoholism or pancreatic stones. \x1b[92m[3] Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (the doctor might refer to them as PERTs) are coated pills often made from pig pancreas juices\x1b[0m. PERTs can help you better absorb fats from your foods, ease symptoms like stomach upset or oily stools, and just help you feel better overall. There are several prescription enzymes. If your doctor prescribes this medication, take it at the start of meals or before you eat snacks, along with a liquid like water. Don't dissolve the pill in a liquid like milk or take it with any over-the-counter stomach acid medicine that has calcium or magnesium. These products can break down the coating and enzymes in your pills. The amount you take depends on your body weight. You'll start with the lowest possible dosage and take more if you need it. You may also take drugs to lower stomach acid along with your PERT. Your doctor can prescribe these, and they're also available over the counter: Proton pump inhibitors like esomeprazole ( Nexium) or omeprazole H2 blockers like cimetidine ( Tagamet, Topcare), famotidine, or ranitidine Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can help you manage pain. Emotional stress can also trigger pancreas inflammation. Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline ( Pamelor) may help ease pain. Gabapentin ( Neurontin, Gralise),, a drug that helps control seizures, can also help fight EPI pain. Pregabalin ( Lyrica), which is used to treat seizures and nerve pain, also shows promise. EPI makes it hard for you to get the right nutrients because your body can't break down your foods. You might not get enough vitamin A, B12, D, E, and K, and you probably don't take in enough fats. \x1b[92m[4] Your doctor can prescribe vitamin supplements to help you get the right levels of\x1b[0m these nutrients. She can also tell you which over-the-counter supplements and dosage to take. It's better for you to eat small meals more often than big ones that are hard to digest. Low fat may be easier on your system if you have a severe case. But if not, make sure you get enough calories and fats to help you stay at a healthy weight. Talk to a dietitian or nutritionist to help you choose the right foods or create meal plans. If you smoke or drink, it's time to stop. Alcohol and tobacco both make it harder for your pancreas to work. Alcoholism is one possible cause of EPI. Smoking can lead to calcium buildup in your pancreas. Cystic fibrosis. \x1b[92m[1] Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, antibiotics, laxatives, and enemas\x1b[0m. You can also eat a high-calorie, high-fat diet or take supplements to get the nutrition you need. If you have cystic fibrosis and EPI, you may also get diabetes. Keep your blood sugar levels under control, and take insulin or other medications if your doctor prescribes them. Shwachman- Diamond syndrome. Your doctor may prescribe PERTs, a high-fat and high-calorie diet, and vitamins and supplements. Scientists are also working to see if stem cell transplants will treat this genetic disease. Chronic pancreatitis: If you have alcoholic pancreatitis, it's important to stop drinking. You may need to enter a treatment program or work with a counselor to stop. If you smoke, stop. If there are stones blocking your ducts, the doctor can remove them. If you have a systemic illness like lupus or cystic fibrosis, treatment for the underlying condition may help the chronic pancreatitis. Yes. Surgery can open ducts that are clogged or blocked by gallstones, and decompression can widen a main pancreatic duct that's too narrow. Another option is to remove your pancreas and give you an autologous islet cell transplant. These are cells from your own body that make insulin. The doctor will get them into your body through a vein in your liver. This surgery can ease severe chronic pancreatitis pain or prevent or ease diabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis. But it's only used if other treatments haven't worked. If other treatments fail, the doctor might remove a portion of your pancreas, but this is usually a last resort.""]",How is cystic fibrosis treated if you have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency?,"Cystic fibrosis is a condition where [92m""Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, antibiotics, laxatives, and enemas"" [1][0m.

PERTs can help you better absorb fats from your foods, ease symptoms like stomach upset or oily stools, and just help you feel better overall. There are several prescription enzymes. If your doctor prescribes this medication, take it at the start of meals or before you eat snacks, along with a liquid like water. Don't dissolve the pill in a liquid like milk or take it with any over-the-counter stomach acid medicine that has calcium or magnesium. These products can break down the coating and enzymes in your pills. The amount you take depends on your body weight. You'll start with the lowest possible dosage and take more if you need it. You may also take drugs to lower stomach acid along with your PERT. Your doctor can prescribe these, and they're also available over the counter: Proton pump inhibitors like esomeprazole ( Nexium) or omeprazole H2 blockers like cimetidine ( Tagamet, Topcare), famotidine, or ranitidine Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can help you manage pain. Emotional stress can also trigger pancreas inflammation. Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline ( Pamelor) may help ease pain. Gabapentin ( Neurontin, Gralise),, a drug that helps control seizures, can also help fight EPI pain. Pregabalin ( Lyrica), which is used to treat seizures and nerve pain, also shows promise. EPI makes it hard for you to get the right nutrients because your body can't break down your foods. You might not get enough vitamin A, B12, D, E, and K, and you probably don't take in enough fats. Your doctor can prescribe vitamin supplements to help you get the right levels of these nutrients. She can also tell you which over-the-counter supplements and dosage to take. It's better for you to eat small meals more often than big ones that are hard to digest. Low fat may be easier on your system if you have a severe case. But if not, make sure you get enough calories and fats to help you stay at a healthy weight. Talk to a dietitian or nutritionist to help you choose the right foods or create meal plans. If you smoke or drink, it's time to stop. Alcohol and tobacco both make it harder for your pancreas to work. Alcoholism is one possible cause of EPI. Smoking can lead to calcium buildup in your pancreas. Cystic fibrosis. Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, antibiotics, laxatives, and enemas. You can also eat a high-calorie, high-fat diet or take supplements to get the nutrition you need. If you have cystic fibrosis and EPI, you may also get diabetes. Keep your blood sugar levels under control, and take insulin or other medications if your doctor prescribes them. Shwachman- Diamond syndrome. Your doctor may prescribe PERTs, a high-fat and high-calorie diet, and vitamins and supplements. Scientists are also working to see if stem cell transplants will treat this genetic disease. Chronic pancreatitis: If you have alcoholic pancreatitis, it's important to stop drinking. You may need to enter a treatment program or work with a counselor to stop. If you smoke, stop. If there are stones blocking your ducts, the doctor can remove them. If you have a systemic illness like lupus or cystic fibrosis, treatment for the underlying condition may help the chronic pancreatitis. Yes. Surgery can open ducts that are clogged or blocked by gallstones, and decompression can widen a main pancreatic duct that's too narrow. Another option is to remove your pancreas and give you an autologous islet cell transplant. These are cells from your own body that make insulin. The doctor will get them into your body through a vein in your liver. This surgery can ease severe chronic pancreatitis pain or prevent or ease diabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis. But it's only used if other treatments haven't worked. If other treatments fail, the doctor might remove a portion of your pancreas, but this is usually a last resort.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/epi-expect'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/epi-expect\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI) causes serious problems with how you digest your food.

66,63,"['https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/small-lymphocytic-lymphoma-cancer\nSmall lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL) is a cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called a ""lymphocyte,"" which helps your body fight infection. You may hear your doctor refer to SLL as a ""non- Hodgkin\'s lymphoma,"" which is a group of cancers that affect lymphocytes. When you have SLL, too many ineffective lymphocytes live and multiply in your lymph nodes. These are pea-sized organs in your neck, groin, armpits, and elsewhere, that are part of your immune system. SLL tends to grow slowly. You may not have any symptoms when you\'re first diagnosed. A lot of people find out they have SLL when it\'s detected after a blood test for another reason. If you\'re not having symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. Instead, your doctor will watch your health regularly and won\'t suggest therapy until you need it. For some people, treatment knocks out the cancer for good, or keeps it from coming back for a long time. It\'s normal to have worries and questions about any serious condition. Learn about your treatment options, and seek out family and friends for support. They can help you get through the emotional and physical challenges ahead. You can\'t ""catch"" SLL like you do a cold or infection. It\'s also not passed on from parents to children. Doctors don\'t know exactly what causes it. They do know, though, that the disease is rare in people under 50. The average age that people get diagnosed with the disease is 65. And it affects men more than women. A few things are linked to a higher risk of getting SLL: You have a condition that causes you to have a weak immune system, like HIV/ AIDS. You\'ve had chemotherapy. You live or work in a farming community. That\'s possibly because of exposure to pesticides and herbicides. You might not have any obvious symptoms when you\'re diagnosed with SLL. The disease might be found during a routine blood test. About one-third of all people with SLL live for years without having symptoms. When symptoms appear, they may include: Painless swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin Loss of appetite Fatigue Night sweats Fever Weight loss Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Have you ever noticed any swelling in your neck, armpit, or groin? Are you often tired? Is your appetite down lately? Have you lost any weight recently? Your doctor may also ask you to get a lymph node biopsy. This is the main test to diagnose SLL. Your doctor removes the lymph node and checks it under a microscope for signs of cancer. Many lymph nodes are near the surface of your skin. If that\'s the case, your doctor will give you a shot that numbs your skin. Then he\'ll make a cut and remove the lymph node. You can usually go home the same day. You\'ll have a small wound with a few stitches that can be removed in about a week. Your doctor may also do two bone marrow tests -- a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy -- to find out how advanced your cancer is. They are usually done together as part of a single procedure that removes marrow from the back of your hip bone. For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor first numbs the skin over your hip and the surface of the bone. He then inserts a thin needle into the bone and uses a syringe to suck out a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Usually the doctor does the bone marrow biopsy next. He removes a small piece of bone and marrow with a slightly larger needle. What stage is my cancer? Do I need treatment right now? What are my treatment options? Are there side effects to the treatments? How will my daily life be affected? What kind of follow-up care and monitoring will I need? If you have no symptoms, your doctor might recommend ""watchful waiting."" During this period, he\'ll monitor you and start treatment if the disease starts to get worse. If you need treatment, you have several options: Chemotherapy. You can get various chemotherapy drugs that kill your cancer cells. The medicine comes in pill form or may be given through an IV. You may be treated with one drug or a combination. Chemotherapy is a key treatment for SLL and can often put the disease in remission, which means you no longer have any signs of cancer, although it can return. Monoclonal antibody therapy. These are drugs that act like man-made antibodies that specifically target cancer cells. They help your immune system destroy them. Rituximab ( Rituxan, Rituxan Hycela) and alemtuzumab ( Campath) are two common types. You get both through an IV. Radiation therapy. This uses high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in one or two groups of lymph nodes in the same part of the body. It may be useful if you\'re in the earlier stages of SLL and the disease hasn\'t spread. Targeted therapy. These drugs attack one or more specific targets on cancer cells. Your doctor might suggest them if you\'ve already had another treatment that didn\'t work. Two examples are ibrutinib ( Imbruvica) and idelalisib ( Zydelig). Both are pills. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat SLL in clinical trials. These test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn\'t available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Besides new drugs, another treatment that may be part of a clinical trial is a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they\'re referring to ""embryo"" stem cells that are used in cloning. The stem cells in a transplant are different. They live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. This procedure may use your own stem cells or stem cells from a donor. If a donor supplies them, you\'ll need to find one who is the right match for you, so your body doesn\'t reject the new stem cells, or start fighting them the way it would fight an infection. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn\'t work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who\'s the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you\'ll most likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. Sometimes radiation therapy is also used. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. Certain medications can make these side effects less severe. When the high-dose chemo is done, you\'ll start the transplant. You get the new stem cells through an IV. You won\'t feel any pain from this, and you\'re awake while it\'s happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. \x1b[92m[1] Try your best to avoid infections\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Eat a healthy diet, get proper rest, and stay away from sick people\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Ask your doctor about which vaccinations you should receive, such as shots to prevent flu and pneumonia\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Living with a serious illness poses many challenges, both physically and emotionally\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] For strength and support, surround yourself with those who care about you\x1b[0m.

SLL tends to be a slow-growing cancer. In time, though, SLL can turn into a more aggressive type of lymphoma. After initial treatment for SLL, many people have a period of remission, when there are no signs of active disease. The illness may not return. But for some people, SLL does come back. If the lymphoma returns, doctors can treat you again. Treatment for disease that returns can be successful, and you may have another period of remission. This keeps your lymphoma under control for many years.

This uses high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in one or two groups of lymph nodes in the same part of the body. It may be useful if you\'re in the earlier stages of SLL and the disease hasn\'t spread. Targeted therapy. These drugs attack one or more specific targets on cancer cells. Your doctor might suggest them if you\'ve already had another treatment that didn\'t work. Two examples are ibrutinib ( Imbruvica) and idelalisib ( Zydelig). Both are pills. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat SLL in clinical trials. These test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn\'t available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Besides new drugs, another treatment that may be part of a clinical trial is a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they\'re referring to ""embryo"" stem cells that are used in cloning. The stem cells in a transplant are different. They live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. This procedure may use your own stem cells or stem cells from a donor. If a donor supplies them, you\'ll need to find one who is the right match for you, so your body doesn\'t reject the new stem cells, or start fighting them the way it would fight an infection. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn\'t work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who\'s the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you\'ll most likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. Sometimes radiation therapy is also used. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. Certain medications can make these side effects less severe. When the high-dose chemo is done, you\'ll start the transplant. You get the new stem cells through an IV. You won\'t feel any pain from this, and you\'re awake while it\'s happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. \x1b[92m[1] Try your best to avoid infections\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Eat a healthy diet, get proper rest, and stay away from sick people\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Ask your doctor about which vaccinations you should receive, such as shots to prevent flu and pneumonia\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Living with a serious illness poses many challenges, both physically and emotionally\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] For strength and support, surround yourself with those who care about you\x1b[0m. They can offer \x1b[92m[6] comfort, as well as practical support\x1b[0m. You may also find it helpful to talk to \x1b[92m[7] a professional counselor, spiritual leader, or a support group\x1b[0m. SLL tends to be a slow-growing cancer. In time, though, SLL can turn into a more aggressive type of lymphoma. After initial treatment for SLL, many people have a period of remission, when there are no signs of active disease. The illness may not return. But for some people, SLL does come back. If the lymphoma returns, doctors can treat you again. Treatment for disease that returns can be successful, and you may have another period of remission. This keeps your lymphoma under control for many years.

68,165,"[""https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/hormone-therapy-overview\nHormones that every woman has in her body -- estrogen and progesterone -- can be fuel for some types of breast cancer. They help the cells grow and spread. Hormone therapy, also called endocrine therapy, adds, blocks, or removes those chemicals to treat the disease. There are two types of hormone therapy for breast cancer: Drugs that stop estrogen and progesterone from helping breast cancer cells grow Drugs or surgery to keep the ovaries from making the hormones Hormone therapy is different from hormone replacement therapy ( HRT), a treatment that adds hormones to the body to counter the effects of menopause. When you're diagnosed with breast cancer, your doctor will test cells from your tumor to see if they have parts on their surfaces called receptors that use estrogen or progesterone. If they do, it means that they depend on these hormones to grow. In that case, your doctor will probably recommend hormone therapy as part of your treatment plan. If you've already been treated for breast cancer, you might use hormone therapy to help keep it from coming back. It also helps lower your odds of getting new cancers in the other breast. Also, if you don't have the disease but have a family history of it, or genes that raise your risk, your doctor may recommend hormone therapy to lower your chances of getting it. Common hormone therapy drugs for breast cancer treatment include: Anastrozole ( Arimidex) Exemestane ( Aromasin) Fulvestrant ( Faslodex) Goserelin ( Zoladex) Letrozole ( Femara) Leuprorelin, leuprolide acetate ( Lupron) Megestrol ( Megace) Tamoxifen ( Nolvadex, Soltamox) Toremifene ( Fareston) Tamoxifen is \x1b[92m[1] a pill that doctors have prescribed for more than 30 years to treat breast cancer\x1b[0m. It works by \x1b[92m[2] keeping estrogen from attaching to the cancer cells\x1b[0m. Doctors first used tamoxifen to treat women whose breast cancer had spread in their bodies because it slowed or stopped the growth of the disease. The drug also lowers the chance that some early stage breast cancers will come back. And it can lower the risk that a woman will get cancer in her other breast later on. Women who are at high risk for breast cancer can take tamoxifen to try to lower their chances of getting the disease. It's an alternative to watchful waiting or having surgery to remove a breast, called a mastectomy, before they get the disease. Tamoxifen \x1b[92m[3] is an option for: Treatment of the earliest form of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS), along with surger\x1b[0my Treatment of abnormal cells in the glands that make milk, called lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS), to lessen the chance that they'll become more advanced breast cancer Treatment of breast cancer in men and women whose cancers use estrogen Treatment of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or that comes back after treatment To prevent breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease Some people should not use tamoxifen: Pregnant women Women planning to get pregnant Men or women who've had blood clots or a stroke Talk to your doctor to see if tamoxifen is right for you. For women, the side effects of tamoxifen are similar to some of the symptoms of menopause. Two of the most common ones are hot flashes and vaginal discharge. Other problems for women may include: Vaginal dryness or itching Irregular periods Headache Nausea and vomiting Skin rash Fatigue Water retention and weight gain The side effects may be similar to menopause, but tamoxifen doesn't trigger menopause. For men, tamoxifen can cause: Headache Nausea and vomiting Skin rash Sexual side effects like erectile dysfunction or a lower sex drive Yes. The risks include: Fertility. Tamoxifen can increase your fertility for a short time. But it might harm a growing baby, so it's important to use some form of barrier birth control while you're taking it, like condoms or a diaphragm. Don't use birth control pills. They can change how the drug works and affect the breast cancer. Tell your doctor right away if you think you've become pregnant while you're taking tamoxifen. Blood clots. Women who take tamoxifen may have a slightly higher risk of blood clots in their lungs or large veins. It's an even bigger risk for smokers. Stroke. Uterine cancer or sarcoma. The drug may make a woman more likely to get these diseases. But this risk is small, and it may be outweighed by the benefits of tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment. Talk to your doctor to know for sure. Cataracts. Tamoxifen seems to give some women a higher chance of having this condition, which clouds the lens inside the eye. People have also reported eye problems such as corneal scarring or retinal changes. Medications. Tamoxifen may affect how other drugs work in your body. A large study by the National Cancer Institute looked at whether tamoxifen lowered cases of breast cancer in healthy women who were known to be likely to get the disease. The results of the trial showed a 50% reduction in breast cancer in the women who took the drug. Studies have also shown that tamoxifen lessens the risk of breast cancer returning in women who have had the earliest form of the disease, ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS). Another drug, raloxifene ( Evista), which prevents the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis, is similar to tamoxifen. Studies have found that it prevents breast cancer in women who are at high risk, but with fewer side effects. The FDA has approved it for breast cancer prevention. Aromatase inhibitors: This type of hormone therapy drug keeps your body from breaking down testosterone into estrogen. They include: Anastrozole ( Arimidex) Exemestane ( Aromasin) Letrozole ( Femara) Aromatase inhibitors keep breast cancer from getting worse for longer than tamoxifen in women who have the advanced disease whose tumors rely on estrogen to grow. For women who have gone through menopause, the drugs can fight cancer even after it has spread to other parts of the body. They are pills that you take once a day. Side effects of aromatase inhibitors include: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea and constipation Hot flashes Headache Bone pain Severe fatigue Skin rash Swelling and water retention Flu-like symptoms Increased bone loss Fulvestrant ( Faslodex): This shot keeps estrogen from attaching to cancer cells. Common side effects include: Pain where you get the shot Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite Weakness and fatigue Hot flashes Cough Muscle, joint, and bone pain Constipation Shortness of breath""]",Does tamoxifen help if you had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)?,"Tamoxifen is [92m""a pill that doctors have prescribed for more than 30 years to treat breast cancer"" [1][0m.

Tamoxifen is an option for: Treatment of the earliest form of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS), along with surgery Treatment of abnormal cells in the glands that make milk, called lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS), to lessen the chance that they'll become more advanced breast cancer Treatment of breast cancer in men and women whose cancers use estrogen Treatment of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or that comes back after treatment To prevent breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease Some people should not use tamoxifen: Pregnant women Women planning to get pregnant Men or women who've had blood clots or a stroke Talk to your doctor to see if tamoxifen is right for you. For women, the side effects of tamoxifen are similar to some of the symptoms of menopause. Two of the most common ones are hot flashes and vaginal discharge. Other problems for women may include: Vaginal dryness or itching Irregular periods Headache Nausea and vomiting Skin rash Fatigue Water retention and weight gain The side effects may be similar to menopause, but tamoxifen doesn't trigger menopause. For men, tamoxifen can cause: Headache Nausea and vomiting Skin rash Sexual side effects like erectile dysfunction or a lower sex drive Yes. The risks include: Fertility. Tamoxifen can increase your fertility for a short time. But it might harm a growing baby, so it's important to use some form of barrier birth control while you're taking it, like condoms or a diaphragm. Don't use birth control pills. They can change how the drug works and affect the breast cancer. Tell your doctor right away if you think you've become pregnant while you're taking tamoxifen. Blood clots. Women who take tamoxifen may have a slightly higher risk of blood clots in their lungs or large veins. It's an even bigger risk for smokers. Stroke. Uterine cancer or sarcoma. The drug may make a woman more likely to get these diseases. But this risk is small, and it may be outweighed by the benefits of tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment. Talk to your doctor to know for sure. Cataracts. Tamoxifen seems to give some women a higher chance of having this condition, which clouds the lens inside the eye. People have also reported eye problems such as corneal scarring or retinal changes. Medications. Tamoxifen may affect how other drugs work in your body. A large study by the National Cancer Institute looked at whether tamoxifen lowered cases of breast cancer in healthy women who were known to be likely to get the disease. The results of the trial showed a 50% reduction in breast cancer in the women who took the drug. Studies have also shown that tamoxifen lessens the risk of breast cancer returning in women who have had the earliest form of the disease, ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS). Another drug, raloxifene ( Evista), which prevents the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis, is similar to tamoxifen. Studies have found that it prevents breast cancer in women who are at high risk, but with fewer side effects. The FDA has approved it for breast cancer prevention. Aromatase inhibitors: This type of hormone therapy drug keeps your body from breaking down testosterone into estrogen. They include: Anastrozole ( Arimidex) Exemestane ( Aromasin) Letrozole ( Femara) Aromatase inhibitors keep breast cancer from getting worse for longer than tamoxifen in women who have the advanced disease whose tumors rely on estrogen to grow. For women who have gone through menopause, the drugs can fight cancer even after it has spread to other parts of the body. They are pills that you take once a day. Side effects of aromatase inhibitors include: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea and constipation Hot flashes Headache Bone pain Severe fatigue Skin rash Swelling and water retention Flu-like symptoms Increased bone loss Fulvestrant ( Faslodex): This shot keeps estrogen from attaching to cancer cells. Common side effects include: Pain where you get the shot Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite Weakness and fatigue Hot flashes Cough Muscle, joint, and bone pain Constipation Shortness of breath""]",['https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/hormone-therapy-overview'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/hormone-therapy-overview\nHormones that every woman has in her body -- estrogen and progesterone -- can be fuel for some types of breast cancer. They help the cells grow and spread. Hormone therapy, also called endocrine therapy, adds, blocks, or removes those chemicals to treat the disease. There are two types of hormone therapy for breast cancer: Drugs that stop estrogen and progesterone from helping breast cancer cells grow Drugs or surgery to keep the ovaries from making the hormones Hormone therapy is different from hormone replacement therapy ( HRT), a treatment that adds hormones to the body to counter the effects of menopause. When you're diagnosed with breast cancer, your doctor will test cells from your tumor to see if they have parts on their surfaces called receptors that use estrogen or progesterone. If they do, it means that they depend on these hormones to grow. In that case, your doctor will probably recommend hormone therapy as part of your treatment plan. If you've already been treated for breast cancer, you might use hormone therapy to help keep it from coming back. It also helps lower your odds of getting new cancers in the other breast. Also, if you don't have the disease but have a family history of it, or genes that raise your risk, your doctor may recommend hormone therapy to lower your chances of getting it. Common hormone therapy drugs for breast cancer treatment include: Anastrozole ( Arimidex) Exemestane ( Aromasin) Fulvestrant ( Faslodex) Goserelin ( Zoladex) Letrozole ( Femara) Leuprorelin, leuprolide acetate ( Lupron) Megestrol ( Megace) Tamoxifen ( Nolvadex, Soltamox) Toremifene ( Fareston) Tamoxifen is \x1b[92m[1] a pill that doctors have prescribed for more than 30 years to treat breast cancer\x1b[0m. It works by \x1b[92m[2] keeping estrogen from attaching to the cancer cells\x1b[0m. Doctors first used tamoxifen to treat women whose breast cancer had spread in their bodies because it slowed or stopped the growth of the disease. The drug also lowers the chance that some early stage breast cancers will come back. And it can lower the risk that a woman will get cancer in her other breast later on.

That\'s because these are common, severe illnesses and leading causes of disability. Depression and bipolar disorder can be emotionally crippling, making it difficult to live life to its fullest. Persistent Depressive Disorder, a newer diagnosis that consolidates chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder, is a condition where a person is depressed for at least 2 years. Persistent Depressive Disorder is a less severe form of depression. Although less extreme, Persistent Depressive Disorder ( PDD) causes chronic or long-lasting moodiness that ranges in severity. It is marked by a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years. In children and teens, moods can be irritable for at least 1 year to be called Persistent Depressive Disorder. PDD can occur alone or with other psychiatric or mood disorders, although not with mania or hypomania. As with depression, PDD is more common in women than in men. A family history of mood disorders is not uncommon. This mood disorder tends to appear earlier than major depression, although it can begin anytime from childhood to later in life. Up to 4% of the general population is affected by PDD. Its cause is not well understood. A combination of factors likely conspires to create this mood disorder. These factors may include: Genetics Abnormalities in the functioning of brain circuits involve in emotional processing Chronic stress or medical illness Isolation Poor coping strategies and problems adjusting to life stresses These factors can feed off each other. For example, if you always see ""the glass as half empty,"" you may reinforce the symptoms of depression. And a chronic mood disorder can sensitize you to stress, further feeding your risk for depression. In addition to chronic low moods, common symptoms of this mood disorder include: Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness Trouble sleeping or daytime sleepiness Poor appetite or eating too much Poor concentration Fatigue or low energy Low self-esteem Trouble concentrating or making decisions A diagnosis of PDD in adults requires at least a two-year history of depressed mood for most of the day on most days, along with at least two of the symptoms noted above. Although some symptoms may overlap, you may be less likely to have weight or sleep changes with PDD than with depression. You may also tend to withdraw more and have stronger feelings of pessimism and inadequacy than with major depression. Staying in a constant state of moodiness is no way to live. That\'s one reason to seek treatment. Another is that PDD can also increase your risk for physical diseases. Yet another reason to pursue treatment? If left untreated, this mood disorder can develop into more severe depression. It can also increase your risk for attempting suicide. Antidepressants \x1b[92m[1] , such as selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants, are often used to treat PDD\x1b[0m. Because you may need to continue treatment for a lengthy period, it\'s important to consider which medications not only work well but also ideally have few side effects. You may need to try more than one medication to find the one that works best. But know that it may take several weeks or longer to take effect. Successful treatment for chronic depression often takes longer than for acute (non-chronic) depression. \x1b[92m[2] Take your medications as your doctor instructs\x1b[0m. If they\'re causing side effects or still not working after several weeks, discuss this with your doctor. Don\'t suddenly stop taking your medications. \x1b[92m[3] Doctors believe treatment for PDD is effective with a combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy\x1b[0m. Specific kinds of talk therapy, such as \x1b[92m[4] cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or interpersonal therapy ( IP\x1b[0mT), are known to be effective forms of psychotherapy that treat PDD. A structured treatment lasting for a certain period of time, CBT involves recognizing and restructuring thoughts. It can help you change your distorted thinking. IPT is also a time-limited, structured treatment. Its focus is on addressing current problems and solving interpersonal conflicts. Psychodynamic psychotherapy involves exploring unhealthy or unsatisfying patterns of behavior and motivations that you may not be consciously aware of which could lead to feelings of depression and negative expectations and life experiences. \x1b[92m[5] Some studies also suggest that aerobic exercise can help with mood disorders\x1b[0m. This is most effective when done four to six times a week. But some exercise is better than none at all. Other changes may also help, including seeking social support and finding an interesting occupation. Used for patients with major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern (formerly known as seasonal affective disorder), \x1b[92m[6] bright-light therapy may also help some people with PDD\x1b[0m. Bipolar disorder causes severe, unusual shifts in mood and energy that affect your ability to do normal tasks at home, school, or work. Cyclothymic disorder is often thought of as a mild form of bipolar disorder. With cyclothymic disorder, you have low-grade high periods (hypomanias) as well as brief, fleeting periods of depression that don\'t last as long (less than 2 weeks at a time) as in a major depressive episode. The hypomanias in cyclothymic disorder are similar to those seen in bipolar II disorder, and do not progress to full-blown manias. For example, you may feel an exaggerated sense of productivity or power, but you don\'t lose connection with reality. In fact, some people feel the ""highs"" of cyclothymic disorder are even enjoyable. They tend to not be as disabling as they are with bipolar disorder. Up to 1% of the U. S. population -- equal numbers of men and women -- has cyclothymia. Its cause is unknown, but genetics may play a role; cyclothymia is more common in people with relatives who have bipolar disorder. Symptoms usually appear in adolescence or young adulthood. But because symptoms are mild, it is often difficult to tell when cyclothymia begins. A diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder may result from simply describing symptoms like these: Episodes that involve brief, recurrent periods of depression and, at other times, episodes of hypomania; this pattern of episodes must be present for at least 2 years. Symptoms that persist, creating fewer than 2 symptom-free months in a row. The episodes of cyclothymic disorder are often somewhat unpredictable. Either depression or hypomania can last for days or weeks, interspersed with a month or two of normal moods. Or, you may have no ""normal"" periods in between. In some cases, cyclothymic disorder progresses to full-blown bipolar disease. Some people with mild symptoms of cyclothymia are able to live successful, fulfilling lives. Others find their relationships troubled by depression, impulsive actions, and strong emotions. For these people, short-term medications may bring relief. However, cyclothymic disorder may not respond as well to medications as does bipolar disorder. A combination of mood stabilizers and psychotherapy is most effective. Mood stabilizers include antiseizure drugs such as lithium, Depakote, Tegretol, or Lamictal.']",How do you treat persistent depressive disorder?,"To treat persistent depressive disorder, [92m""Antidepressants, such as selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants, are often used"" [1][0m.

Successful treatment for chronic depression often takes longer than for acute (non-chronic) depression. \x1b[92m[2] Take your medications as your doctor instructs\x1b[0m. If they\'re causing side effects or still not working after several weeks, discuss this with your doctor. Don\'t suddenly stop taking your medications. \x1b[92m[3] Doctors believe treatment for PDD is effective with a combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy\x1b[0m. Specific kinds of talk therapy, such as \x1b[92m[4] cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or interpersonal therapy ( IP\x1b[0mT), are known to be effective forms of psychotherapy that treat PDD. A structured treatment lasting for a certain period of time, CBT involves recognizing and restructuring thoughts. It can help you change your distorted thinking. IPT is also a time-limited, structured treatment. Its focus is on addressing current problems and solving interpersonal conflicts. Psychodynamic psychotherapy involves exploring unhealthy or unsatisfying patterns of behavior and motivations that you may not be consciously aware of which could lead to feelings of depression and negative expectations and life experiences. \x1b[92m[5] Some studies also suggest that aerobic exercise can help with mood disorders\x1b[0m. This is most effective when done four to six times a week. But some exercise is better than none at all. Other changes may also help, including seeking social support and finding an interesting occupation. Used for patients with major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern (formerly known as seasonal affective disorder), \x1b[92m[6] bright-light therapy may also help some people with PDD\x1b[0m. Bipolar disorder causes severe, unusual shifts in mood and energy that affect your ability to do normal tasks at home, school, or work. Cyclothymic disorder is often thought of as a mild form of bipolar disorder. With cyclothymic disorder, you have low-grade high periods (hypomanias) as well as brief, fleeting periods of depression that don\'t last as long (less than 2 weeks at a time) as in a major depressive episode. The hypomanias in cyclothymic disorder are similar to those seen in bipolar II disorder, and do not progress to full-blown manias. For example, you may feel an exaggerated sense of productivity or power, but you don\'t lose connection with reality. In fact, some people feel the ""highs"" of cyclothymic disorder are even enjoyable. They tend to not be as disabling as they are with bipolar disorder. Up to 1% of the U. S. population -- equal numbers of men and women -- has cyclothymia. Its cause is unknown, but genetics may play a role; cyclothymia is more common in people with relatives who have bipolar disorder. Symptoms usually appear in adolescence or young adulthood. But because symptoms are mild, it is often difficult to tell when cyclothymia begins. A diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder may result from simply describing symptoms like these: Episodes that involve brief, recurrent periods of depression and, at other times, episodes of hypomania; this pattern of episodes must be present for at least 2 years. Symptoms that persist, creating fewer than 2 symptom-free months in a row. The episodes of cyclothymic disorder are often somewhat unpredictable. Either depression or hypomania can last for days or weeks, interspersed with a month or two of normal moods. Or, you may have no ""normal"" periods in between. In some cases, cyclothymic disorder progresses to full-blown bipolar disease. Some people with mild symptoms of cyclothymia are able to live successful, fulfilling lives. Others find their relationships troubled by depression, impulsive actions, and strong emotions. For these people, short-term medications may bring relief. However, cyclothymic disorder may not respond as well to medications as does bipolar disorder. A combination of mood stabilizers and psychotherapy is most effective. Mood stabilizers include antiseizure drugs such as lithium, Depakote, Tegretol, or Lamictal.']",gKMqFz1xmDEbCM8,"[18.3754456043243,7.37431383132935,24.5212030410767,11.1024308204651,10.1810603141785]",2024-09-06 21:52:24.276163+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":3},{""annotations"":[1,1],""sentence_id"":4}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":3},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":4}]","[True, True, True, True, True]",3,3

He'll also ask for your personal and family medical history to figure out what's causing your troubles. He may run tests to rule out other health problems that might look like allergic reactions. He could ask you to keep track of potential triggers and your reactions for a week to help him diagnose you. After this, he'll choose a testing method. The most common test for respiratory, penicillin, insect sting, skin, and food allergies is a skin prick or scratch test. The doctor scratches a small amount of the allergen into your skin and watches for swelling, itchiness, and redness in that area. Other tests look for signs in the blood that are linked to allergies. Results can differ from one test or one lab to another. Your doctor can help figure out which tests are best for you and help you understand what the results mean. The best option is avoiding the things that trigger your symptoms in the first place, but that isn't always easy. Nasal steroids, which you can get over the counter or by prescription, are often the first drug recommended for nasal allergies (hay fever). Your doctor might prescribe anti-inflammatory steroid drugs, like prednisone, for severe symptoms. Antihistamines , which you can get over the counter, block the effects of chemicals your body makes that cause the allergic reactions. An epinephrine shot is for an emergency, when an allergic reaction becomes life-threatening. It works quickly to bring up low blood pressure and open narrowed airways. Allergy shots -- also called immunotherapy or allergy desensitization therapy -- may help ease attacks. You'll get small amounts of things that trigger your symptoms, like pollen. They'll help your body get used to that allergen. It may take a year before they really start to work. Skin conditions: Atopic and contact dermatitis can be treated with a variety of anti-inflammatory steroids. You can put them on your skin or take them by mouth. Mild cases of hives may not need treatment. But moderate to severe cases require antihistamines or steroid pills. Stomach medicines that have some antihistamine effect, like ranitidine, may also help. Angioedema, a swelling that sometimes comes with them, is almost always treated. It can be life-threatening. Respiratory allergies: Doctors treat allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, with corticosteroid sprays or antihistamines. They work well over the long term, but you have to take them regularly. You can get three kinds -- budesonide, fluticasone, and triamcinolone -- over the counter. Over-the-counter antihistamines such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, and loratadine can help. You can also take a once-a-day med called a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Allergy shots work well after the first year. Another treatment that gives you a bit of the allergen is available in tablets or drops that you place under your tongue. Food allergies: \x1b[92m[1] Your best bet is to stay away from the problem food\x1b[0m. If your reaction is mild -- the food makes you itch or makes your eyes water -- \x1b[92m[2] antihistamines or topical creams might be all you need\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] If you're highly allergic and likely to go into anaphylactic shock, your doctor will prescribe an emergency kit and show you how to use it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Keep two with you at all times\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] They contain a preloaded epinephrine shot\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] If you think you're having an emergency, don't wait to take it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Then call 911\x1b[0m.

Some skin rashes caused by drug allergies respond to antihistamines. Others require steroids you take by mouth or rub onto your skin. An allergy specialist can help you get used to some antibiotics. Insect sting allergies: Again, the best thing is to try to avoid getting stung. But allergy shots can make a reaction less severe.

71,139,"[""https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-liver-biopsy\nA liver biopsy is a procedure in which a small needle is inserted into the liver to collect a tissue sample. The tissue is then analyzed in a laboratory to help doctors diagnose a variety of disorders and diseases in the liver. A liver biopsy is most often performed to help identify the cause of: Persistent abnormal liver blood tests (liver enzymes) Unexplained yellowing of the skin (jaundice) A liver abnormality found on ultrasound, CT scan, or nuclear scan Unexplained enlargement of the liver A liver biopsy can also be used to estimate the degree of liver damage, to grade and stage hepatitis B and C, and to determine the best treatment for the damage or disease. In most instances, there are no complications in obtaining a liver biopsy. However, rarely, internal bleeding may occur, as well as a leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder. There is a slight risk of a pneumothorax, also called a collapsed lung, if the biopsy needle makes a hole in the chest wall causing air to enter. When preparing for a liver biopsy, you should: Tell your doctor if you're pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, are allergic to any medications, or have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medications such as aspirin, Coumadin, Plavix, or Eliquis. Your doctor may prescribe an alternate method for thinning your blood before the procedure. Talk with your doctor about the procedure. Have any necessary blood tests done. Find out how long before the procedure you'll need to stop eating. Arrange for a ride home after the procedure. For the week before the procedure, do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Naprosyn, or Indocin) unless otherwise advised by your doctor. Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor. Laboratory tests will be performed on the day of a liver biopsy or 2-3 days before the procedure, as directed by your doctor. These tests may include a blood count, a platelet count, and a measurement of your blood's ability to clot. Before the procedure: A doctor will explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications, and answer any questions you may have. During the procedure, which takes about 5 minutes: You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back, with your right elbow out to the side and your right hand under your head. It is important that you remain as still as possible during the procedure. An ultrasound may be used to mark the location of your liver. You may receive a small dose of a sedative just prior to the procedure. The doctor will clean and numb an area on your upper abdomen with a local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication). The doctor will then make a small incision on your upper abdomen and insert a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis. After the procedure: You will stay in a recovery room for up to 4 hours for observation. You may feel minor pain or soreness at the biopsy site and discomfort or a dull pain in your shoulders or back. If necessary, a pain medication will be prescribed for you. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after the procedure. Avoid taking aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Naprosyn, Indocin, or Motrin) for one week after the procedure. You may take acetaminophen ( Tylenol) if needed. Do not perform vigorous physical activity or heavy lifting for at least 24 hours and up to 1 week after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the biopsy results with you several days after the procedure. Two other methods of liver biopsy may also be available: laparoscopic and transvenous. During a laparoscopic biopsy, a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the doctor watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver. A transvenous biopsy may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver.

A liver biopsy is most often performed to help identify the cause of: Persistent abnormal liver blood tests (liver enzymes) Unexplained yellowing of the skin (jaundice) A liver abnormality found on ultrasound, CT scan, or nuclear scan Unexplained enlargement of the liver A liver biopsy can also be used to estimate the degree of liver damage, to grade and stage hepatitis B and C, and to determine the best treatment for the damage or disease. In most instances, there are no complications in obtaining a liver biopsy. However, rarely, internal bleeding may occur, as well as a leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder. There is a slight risk of a pneumothorax, also called a collapsed lung, if the biopsy needle makes a hole in the chest wall causing air to enter. When preparing for a liver biopsy, you should: Tell your doctor if you're pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, are allergic to any medications, or have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medications such as aspirin, Coumadin, Plavix, or Eliquis. Your doctor may prescribe an alternate method for thinning your blood before the procedure. Talk with your doctor about the procedure. Have any necessary blood tests done. Find out how long before the procedure you'll need to stop eating. Arrange for a ride home after the procedure. For the week before the procedure, do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Naprosyn, or Indocin) unless otherwise advised by your doctor. Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor. Laboratory tests will be performed on the day of a liver biopsy or 2-3 days before the procedure, as directed by your doctor. These tests may include a blood count, a platelet count, and a measurement of your blood's ability to clot. Before the procedure: A doctor will explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications, and answer any questions you may have. During the procedure, which takes about 5 minutes: You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back, with your right elbow out to the side and your right hand under your head. It is important that you remain as still as possible during the procedure. An ultrasound may be used to mark the location of your liver. You may receive a small dose of a sedative just prior to the procedure. The doctor will clean and numb an area on your upper abdomen with a local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication). The doctor will then make a small incision on your upper abdomen and insert a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis. After the procedure: You will stay in a recovery room for up to 4 hours for observation. You may feel minor pain or soreness at the biopsy site and discomfort or a dull pain in your shoulders or back. If necessary, a pain medication will be prescribed for you. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after the procedure. Avoid taking aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Naprosyn, Indocin, or Motrin) for one week after the procedure. You may take acetaminophen ( Tylenol) if needed. Do not perform vigorous physical activity or heavy lifting for at least 24 hours and up to 1 week after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the biopsy results with you several days after the procedure. Two other methods of liver biopsy may also be available: laparoscopic and transvenous. During a laparoscopic biopsy, a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the doctor watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver. A transvenous biopsy may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver. A biopsy needle is placed into the catheter and then into the liver to obtain a sample. \x1b[92m[1] If these symptoms occur within 72 hours of the biopsy, call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room: Fever Dizziness Chills Difficulty breathing Chest pain Abdominal swelling or bloating Increasing abdominal pain Tenderness or severe pain or redness at the site of the biopsy or in the shoulder, chest, or abdomen\x1b[0m""]",DO1DhOd0kwIHrgb,[],2024-09-06 20:38:34.562175+00,"[{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":2},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":3},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":4},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":5},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":6},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":7},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":8}]","[{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":2},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":3},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":4},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":5},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":6},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":7},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":8}]",[True],1,2
72,71,"[""https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/pinched-nerve-in-elbow\nA pinched nerve happens when too much pressure is placed against a nerve by bones, tendons, muscles, or cartilage. It can start in several places throughout your body, usually in the joints. When a pinched nerve is in your elbow, it's called √¢\x80\x9culnar nerve entrapment.√¢\x80\x9d It can leave your arm and hand feeling sore, numb, or weak. The ulnar nerve runs the entire length of your arm. It helps control the muscles in the forearm and hand. Sensations affecting your ring finger and little finger also travel though the ulnar nerve. Its most vulnerable point is at the elbow. If you've ever hit your elbow, or √¢\x80\x9cfunny bone,√¢\x80\x9d hard and felt a tingling down to your fingers, you've compressed your ulnar nerve. Leaning on your elbow for a long time can also irritate the nerve. Whenever you bend your elbow, you're forcing the nerve to stretch around the bones in the joint. If you sleep with your elbows bent, for instance, or you keep your elbows bent for a long time, you're putting more pressure on your ulnar nerve. A buildup of fluid in the elbow, caused by a condition such as bursitis, for instance, can also entrap the nerve. One of the first signs that you may have a pinched nerve in the elbow is weakness in your hand. You may not be able to grip things as tightly as you used to or lift heavy things the way you once did. Your hand may be more tender, more easily hurt, too. The ring finger and little finger may not be as strong and flexible as they used to be. Other symptoms of ulnar nerve entrapment include: tingling or numbness in the hand, especially the ring and little fingers cold sensitivity in the affected arm or hand tenderness at the elbow These symptoms tend to come and go at first. You may notice them more when your elbow is bent. You may even wake up in the middle of the night with a tingling feeling in your fingers. Reasons for compression of the ulnar nerve in the elbow aren't always known. You may not recall injuring your elbow or bending your elbow too much. Your chances of getting ulnar nerve entrapment are higher, though, if your elbow: has arthritis has been fractured was dislocated has been repeatedly injured If a pinched nerve in the elbow goes untreated for a long time, there could be permanent damage. Muscles controlled by the nerve may begin to get smaller and shorter. This is called muscle wasting, and it can't always be reversed. To avoid this problem, see a doctor quickly if you start to have severe pain, weakness, or tingling in your arm or hand. Even if your discomfort doesn't feel serious, call your doctor if it's been with you for at least 6 weeks. To get a proper diagnosis, you should see an orthopedist. Try to find someone who specializes in elbows and wrists. If you have arthritis and you see a rheumatologist, you may want to start with that doctor. She may later recommend you to an orthopedist. What you might expect: Medical review: Diagnosing the problem usually starts with a review of your medical history and your lifestyle. If you do a lot of heavy lifting or play contact sports, these would be helpful details to pass along. Physical exam: Your doctor will likely do a physical exam of your arm, tapping the spot where the nerve crosses the bone in your elbow. The doctor may also want to see whether the nerve itself slides out of its proper position when your elbow bends. You may be asked to put your arms in different positions and turn your neck from side to side to see whether that causes any pain or numbness. Your doctor may check the strength in your fingers and hand, and test for feeling in those areas. X-ray: You might have an X-ray taken so your doctor can look for bone spurs or arthritis. These may be placing pressure on your nerve. Nerve conduction study: In this test, the doctor stimulates your ulnar nerve in various places. An area that takes longer to respond may be where the nerve is compressed. This test is also helpful in diagnosing muscle wasting caused by nerve problems. Once you've been diagnosed with ulnar nerve entrapment, it will be time to decide how to treat the problem. The severity of the condition will help you and your doctor decide whether surgery or a less-invasive strategy is best. \x1b[92m[1] Nonsurgical treatments include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: NSAIDs can reduce pain and inflammation\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] A splint or brace: These can keep your elbow straight, especially while you're sleeping\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] An elbow pad: This helps reduce pressure on the joint\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Occupational and physical therapy: This will improve the strength and flexibility of your arm and hand\x1b[0m.

If nonsurgical options haven't eased your symptoms or there is \x1b[92m[6] obvious muscle damage, surgery may be necessary\x1b[0m. The goal of surgery is to remove pressure from the nerve. In some cases, the nerve is moved as part of the operation. Some surgical treatment options include: Ulnar nerve anterior transposition: This moves the ulnar nerve so that it doesn't stretch over the bony parts of the elbow joint. Medial epicondylectomy: This removes the bump on the inside of the elbow joint, which takes pressure off the ulnar nerve. Cubital tunnel release: This removes part of the compressed tube through which the nerve passes in the elbow. If you have surgery, physical therapy to regain your arm and hand strength will likely be advised. You might need a splint for a few weeks to help make sure the elbow heals properly. Ongoing care for your elbow should include steps to avoid injuring or irritating the nerve further. You should be careful to avoid trauma to your elbow.

But many people who have it use treatments that aren't likely to help. So before you run to the drugstore, you'll want to be sure you know how to handle this condition. The sinuses are small cavities in the skull that are normally filled with air. They make mucus, which helps keep the nasal passages clear of allergens and pollutants. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the tissue that lines these cavities. In some cases, this swelling blocks off the sinuses, trapping mucus and air inside them. This can cause pain and pressure. Sometimes, it can lead to a bacterial infection. Do you know the two types of sinusitis? Acute sinusitis lasts up to 4 weeks. Chronic sinusitis lasts at least several weeks and can linger for years. Its cause can be hard to pin down -- and hard to treat. Sinusitis might start because of a cold or allergies. Fungus can cause it for people who have weak immune systems. Sometimes, chronic sinusitis is due to problems with the structure of the nasal passages, or a growth such as a nasal polyp that keeps the sinuses from draining normally. Acute and chronic sinusitis have similar symptoms: Facial pressure and pain Thick discolored mucus Congestion The key is to figure out the cause. For instance, if your sinusitis is due to allergies, then \x1b[92m[5] decongestants\x1b[0m alone will probably not help much. \x1b[92m[1] If you have symptoms for more than a couple of days, check in with your doctor\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] With a good exam -- and sometimes imaging tests, like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs -- you may be able to figure out exactly what's causing the problem\x1b[0m. Often, the best sinusitis treatment is a combination of different approaches -- typically medication plus self-care. Antibiotics . \x1b[92m[3] If your doctor thinks a bacterial infection is to blame, he may prescribe antibiotics\x1b[0m. For acute sinusitis, you typically take them for 10-14 days. For chronic sinusitis, it might be longer. Antibiotics only help with bacterial infections. They won't help if your sinusitis is caused by viruses or other problems. Some studies suggest that bacteria cause very few cases of the condition and that antibiotics are widely overused. Painkillers. \x1b[92m[4] Many people with sinusitis take over-the-counter ( OTC) pain medicines, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to ease discomfor\x1b[0mt. Follow the instructions on the label, and don't take them for more than 10 days. Check with your doctor to see which one is right for you. Decongestants . \x1b[92m[6] These meds lower the amount of mucus in the sinuses\x1b[0m. Some are available as nasal sprays. Others are pills. If you use decongestant nasal sprays for more than 3 days, they may actually make you more congested. Follow the instructions on the label. Allergy medicines. Many cases of sinusitis are due to uncontrolled allergies. \x1b[92m[7] If you've never been diagnosed with allergies, it might be worth doing some allergy testing to see if you have them\x1b[0m. If you do, medication (like antihistamines) and avoiding your triggers will help. Another option is to get allergy shots, a long-term treatment that gradually makes you less sensitive to the things that set off your symptoms. Steroids. \x1b[92m[8] In some cases, your doctor may prescribe inhaled steroids to bring down the swelling in the sinus membranes\x1b[0m. For tough cases of chronic sinusitis, you may need to take steroids by mouth. Surgery. \x1b[92m[9] Occasionally, if you have chronic sinusitis or acute sinusitis that keeps coming back, an operation may be the best choice\x1b[0m. The surgeon can remove blockages and enlarge the sinus passages, which makes it easier for them to drain. While medicines can help, many cases of sinusitis go away on their own without any medical treatment. If you often get the condition, many of these same approaches will help you prevent it, too. Humidify. Use a humidifier in rooms where you spend a lot of time. Follow the instructions for regular cleaning. Breathe in steam vapors. You can either run the shower and sit in the bathroom, or breathe in steam from a bowl of warm (but not too hot) water. The steam vapors ease congested and swollen nasal passages. Use warm heat. Put a warm, wet towel on your face. It can take off some of the pressure. Try a nasal saline solution. While they don't contain medicine (saline is salt water), they can help keep your nasal passages moist. Flush out your sinuses. Nasal irrigation with salt water can clear out mucus (and other debris) and keep your sinuses moist. You can use bulb syringes or neti pots, for example. Use distilled, sterile, or previously boiled water to make up the irrigation solution. Rinse the device after each use and let it air dry. Drink lots of fluids.

But many people who have it use treatments that aren't likely to help. So before you run to the drugstore, you'll want to be sure you know how to handle this condition. The sinuses are small cavities in the skull that are normally filled with air. They make mucus, which helps keep the nasal passages clear of allergens and pollutants. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the tissue that lines these cavities. In some cases, this swelling blocks off the sinuses, trapping mucus and air inside them. This can cause pain and pressure. Sometimes, it can lead to a bacterial infection. Do you know the two types of sinusitis? Acute sinusitis lasts up to 4 weeks. Chronic sinusitis lasts at least several weeks and can linger for years. Its cause can be hard to pin down -- and hard to treat. Sinusitis might start because of a cold or allergies. Fungus can cause it for people who have weak immune systems. Sometimes, chronic sinusitis is due to problems with the structure of the nasal passages, or a growth such as a nasal polyp that keeps the sinuses from draining normally. Acute and chronic sinusitis have similar symptoms: Facial pressure and pain Thick discolored mucus Congestion The key is to figure out the cause. For instance, if your sinusitis is due to allergies, then decongestants alone will probably not help much. If you have symptoms for more than a couple of days, check in with your doctor. With a good exam -- and sometimes imaging tests, like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs -- you may be able to figure out exactly what's causing the problem. Often, the best sinusitis treatment is a combination of different approaches -- typically medication plus self-care. Antibiotics . If your doctor thinks a bacterial infection is to blame, he may prescribe antibiotics. For acute sinusitis, you typically take them for 10-14 days. For chronic sinusitis, it might be longer. Antibiotics only help with bacterial infections. They won't help if your sinusitis is caused by viruses or other problems. Some studies suggest that bacteria cause very few cases of the condition and that antibiotics are widely overused. Painkillers. Many people with sinusitis take over-the-counter ( OTC) pain medicines, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to ease discomfort. Follow the instructions on the label, and don't take them for more than 10 days. Check with your doctor to see which one is right for you. Decongestants . These meds lower the amount of mucus in the sinuses. Some are available as nasal sprays. Others are pills. If you use decongestant nasal sprays for more than 3 days, they may actually make you more congested. Follow the instructions on the label. Allergy medicines. Many cases of sinusitis are due to uncontrolled allergies. If you've never been diagnosed with allergies, it might be worth doing some allergy testing to see if you have them. If you do, medication (like antihistamines) and avoiding your triggers will help. Another option is to get allergy shots, a long-term treatment that gradually makes you less sensitive to the things that set off your symptoms. Steroids. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe inhaled steroids to bring down the swelling in the sinus membranes. For tough cases of chronic sinusitis, you may need to take steroids by mouth. Surgery. Occasionally, if you have chronic sinusitis or acute sinusitis that keeps coming back, an operation may be the best choice. The surgeon can remove blockages and enlarge the sinus passages, which makes it easier for them to drain. While medicines can help, many cases of sinusitis go away on their own without any medical treatment. If you often get the condition, many of these same approaches will help you prevent it, too. Humidify. Use a humidifier in rooms where you spend a lot of time. Follow the instructions for regular cleaning. Breathe in steam vapors.

74,89,"[""https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/psoriasis-digestive-disorders\nIt may seem odd, but it's true. Psoriasis is related to some digestive disorders that are also autoimmune diseases. Right now, there isn't anything you can change about your lifestyle to specifically keep you from getting one of these digestive problems that's written into your genes. Research into the complex relationship is ongoing, and there's a lot more still to be learned. Here's what we know so far. There's a strong link between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. IBD includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis ( UC). Crohn's can affect any part of the stomach and intestines; UC usually affects the lower parts of your GI tract, the colon and rectum. After looking at the gene patterns of tens of thousands of people with serious autoimmune diseases, scientists are finding that the same problem genes can be responsible for psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. These conditions trigger inflammation in similar ways, too. Your skin and intestines are organs made up of tissue that absorbs things more easily, so it's not surprising that both are sensitive and react to the inflammation signals that travel throughout your body. One study found that 1 in 10 women with psoriasis develop an IBD. ( The odds were even higher for those with psoriatic arthritis, another condition linked with psoriasis.) People with psoriasis are 2.5 times more likely to get Crohn's and 1.6 times more likely to get UC. Some people get a digestive disorder first and psoriasis later. IBD and psoriasis also share a connection with obesity. Fat tissue seems to make chemicals that change how the body works, including the immune system. Having a lot of extra weight raises your odds of having psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. It can also make them get worse faster and make treatments less effective. When you have celiac disease, you can't digest gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease can damage your small intestine and prevent it from absorbing key nutrients. The chance of getting celiac disease is nearly 3 times higher among people with psoriasis. About 4 of every 100 have it. Research shows that the higher the levels of specific antibodies related to celiac disease, the worse psoriasis tends to be. \x1b[92m[4] Watch for signs of digestive issues, and tell your doctor so you can get tested and change your treatment plan, if needed\x1b[0m. IBD ( Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) symptoms include: \x1b[92m[1] Diarrhea\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] Belly cramps\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] Blood in your poop\x1b[0m Celiac disease or gluten sensitivity symptoms in adults may include: \x1b[92m[1] Diarrhea\x1b[0m Bad-smelling poop Fatigue Feeling weak, dizzy, or short of breath Cold hands and feet Sore, achy joints You might mistake celiac disease for psoriatic arthritis, because both can cause joint pain and fatigue. Your doctor can order a blood test that measures levels of antibodies to check whether gluten affects you. It's often helpful to have \x1b[92m[5] a specialist called a gastroenterologist as well as a dermatologist on your health care team\x1b[0m. You and your team can decide what treatment is right for you based on what and how severe your symptoms are and the medication side effects you're willing to deal with. \x1b[92m[6] The same drug may work for both your psoriasis and IBD\x1b[0m. But \x1b[92m[7] some biologic medications are more likely than others to trigger a flare for someone who already has an IBD\x1b[0m. Following a gluten-free diet has helped some people clear their psoriasis lesions as well as manage celiac. What's more, going gluten-free has helped people who test positive for a gluten sensitivity even when they don't have any celiac symptoms or signs of the disease. \x1b[92m[8] Healthy habits -- including a nutritious diet and regular exercise\x1b[0m -- can help you feel better, lower your chance of having flares, and get a better result from treatment. Of course, \x1b[92m[9] take your medication as directed\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] Don't smoke, and limit how much alcohol you drink\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] Find ways to ease stress, maybe by joining a support group\x1b[0m.

Following a gluten-free diet has helped some people clear their psoriasis lesions as well as manage celiac. What's more, going gluten-free has helped people who test positive for a gluten sensitivity even when they don't have any celiac symptoms or signs of the disease. Healthy habits -- including a nutritious diet and regular exercise -- can help you feel better, lower your chance of having flares, and get a better result from treatment.

Let your doctor know about any new or changing symptoms.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/psoriasis-digestive-disorders'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/psoriasis-digestive-disorders\nIt may seem odd, but it's true. Psoriasis is related to some digestive disorders that are also autoimmune diseases. Right now, there isn't anything you can change about your lifestyle to specifically keep you from getting one of these digestive problems that's written into your genes. Research into the complex relationship is ongoing, and there's a lot more still to be learned. Here's what we know so far. There's a strong link between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. IBD includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis ( UC). Crohn's can affect any part of the stomach and intestines; UC usually affects the lower parts of your GI tract, the colon and rectum. After looking at the gene patterns of tens of thousands of people with serious autoimmune diseases, scientists are finding that the same problem genes can be responsible for psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. These conditions trigger inflammation in similar ways, too. Your skin and intestines are organs made up of tissue that absorbs things more easily, so it's not surprising that both are sensitive and react to the inflammation signals that travel throughout your body. One study found that 1 in 10 women with psoriasis develop an IBD. ( The odds were even higher for those with psoriatic arthritis, another condition linked with psoriasis.) People with psoriasis are 2.5 times more likely to get Crohn's and 1.6 times more likely to get UC. Some people get a digestive disorder first and psoriasis later. IBD and psoriasis also share a connection with obesity. Fat tissue seems to make chemicals that change how the body works, including the immune system. Having a lot of extra weight raises your odds of having psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. It can also make them get worse faster and make treatments less effective. When you have celiac disease, you can't digest gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease can damage your small intestine and prevent it from absorbing key nutrients. The chance of getting celiac disease is nearly 3 times higher among people with psoriasis. About 4 of every 100 have it. Research shows that the higher the levels of specific antibodies related to celiac disease, the worse psoriasis tends to be. \x1b[92m[4] Watch for signs of digestive issues, and tell your doctor so you can get tested and change your treatment plan, if needed\x1b[0m. IBD ( Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) symptoms include: \x1b[92m[1] Diarrhea\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] Belly cramps\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] Blood in your poop\x1b[0m Celiac disease or gluten sensitivity symptoms in adults may include: \x1b[92m[1] Diarrhea\x1b[0m Bad-smelling poop Fatigue Feeling weak, dizzy, or short of breath Cold hands and feet Sore, achy joints You might mistake celiac disease for psoriatic arthritis, because both can cause joint pain and fatigue. Your doctor can order a blood test that measures levels of antibodies to check whether gluten affects you. It's often helpful to have \x1b[92m[5] a specialist called a gastroenterologist as well as a dermatologist on your health care team\x1b[0m. You and your team can decide what treatment is right for you based on what and how severe your symptoms are and the medication side effects you're willing to deal with. \x1b[92m[6] The same drug may work for both your psoriasis and IBD\x1b[0m.

But it doesn't have to. There are many ways to treat it. These include simple changes in behavior and lifestyle, medications, and alternative treatments. Simple changes to your daily routine can help you manage OAB symptoms: Kegel exercises. Over time, these help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. They also build up the muscle that controls the flow of urine from your body. When it works like it should, it helps you to hold your pee until you can get to the bathroom. When it doesn't, you have leaks. To do Kegels, pretend you're going to pee, then squeeze the muscles you'd use to stop it. You'll have to do them a few times a day for 6 to 8 weeks before you see a change in your OAB symptoms. Train your bladder. This \x1b[92m[2] works a lot like Kegels\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] \x1b[92m[4] Hold your pee when you feel like you need to go\x1b[0m\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] It's easier if you do it while sitting down\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Sit still, and squeeze your pelvic floor muscles several times in a row\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] When the urge to pee passes, walk slowly to the bathroom\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Be patient\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] It may take up to 8 weeks to see results\x1b[0m. Watch what you eat and drink. Ask your doctor if you should limit how much you drink at certain times of the day. He might also tell you to avoid coffee, tea, alcohol, sodas, and juices. Ditto for fruits like oranges and grapefruit, and spicy foods. All of them can make your OAB symptoms worse. Keep your weight down. Exercise and weight loss can improve urinary incontinence and OAB symptoms. It'll ease the stress on your bladder and lead to fewer accidents. Double void. This means you pee, wait a few minutes, and then go again. It'll help make sure your bladder's empty. That way, you can avoid a quick trip back to the bathroom. Set a schedule If you can, try to space out your bathroom visits. Aim for every 2 to 4 hours. This way, you train yourself to pee at the same times every day. Stop smoking. Cigarette smoke irritates your bladder. It can also cause a hacking cough, which could trigger leaks. Talk to your doctor about OAB. He can prescribe a drug that'll help you regain your quality of life. Medications for OAB relax the bladder muscle, increase urine storage and control bladder muscle spasms.by blocking nerve signals in your brain. Doctors prescribe them to both men and women. They include: Darifenacin ( Enablex) Fesoterodine ( Toviaz) Mirabegron ( Myrbetriq). Oxybutynin ( Ditropan, Ditropan XL) Oxybutynin gel or patch ( Gelnique, Oxytrol), which you rub or place on your skin Solifenacin ( VESIcare) Tolterodine ( Detrol, Detrol LA) Trospium ( Sanctura, Sanctura XR) Women who've been through menopause can also use a form of the hormone estrogen that you apply inside your vagina. Doctors also treat men with drugs that relax a muscle at the bladder neck and prostate to help with emptying. They include: Alfuzosin ( Uroxatral) Doxazosin ( Cardura, Cardura XL) Silodosin ( Rapaflo) Tamsulosin ( Flomax) Botox injections: Onabotulinumtoxin A ( Botox) blocks nerve activity in the muscles of your bladder so it relaxes. That helps it hold urine and ease OAB. You'll get the shots in your doctor's office. About 6% of patients who receive botox may temporarily be unable to pee. You must be able and willing to catheterize if you cannot pee after botox. Your doctor may suggest them if other methods don't help. You'll get them in his office or a clinic. Sacral nerve stimulation: The doctor uses electricity to stimulate the nerves that control your bladder. He'll place a small device under the skin in your butt. It sends mild electric charges through a wire to a nerve in your lower back. This helps build bladder control. This procedure is commonly referred to as a bladder pacemaker. The main limitation with this treatment is the inability to obtain a spinal MRI. Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation: The doctor places a needle on nerves near your ankle that affect bladder control. You'll have one session a week for 12 weeks, then maintenance treatments as needed. This procedure is done in the office. In rare cases, augmentation cystoplasty, where intestine is used to make the bladder bigger or urinary diversion, an alternate route for bladder drainage for severe, complicated OAB patients may be considered Overactive bladder doesn't have to get in the way of your daily life.

It can be \x1b[92m[1] a big help at a time when you may be looking for relief from pain or new ways to deal with a swirl of intense feelings\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Unlike hospice care, which is only given at the end of life\x1b[0m, \x1b[92m[3] you can get palliative care at any stage of a serious illness, starting at your diagnosis\x1b[0m. It can continue for weeks or months, including while you get treatment. Any medical professional -- such as a doctor, nurse, dietitian, pharmacist, or therapist -- can provide palliative care, but there are also specialists in the field. Most hospitals have palliative services, and some have centers that you can visit without having to stay overnight. Your primary care doctor may also be involved in the palliative care you get. One of the most important goals of palliative care is easing the physical symptoms of the cancer itself and any side effects from treatment. Some of the prostate cancer symptoms you can get help with are: Trouble peeing or needing to pee often Problems with erections or ejaculation Loss of sex drive Pain in your lower back, hips, and upper thighs Different pain relief drugs can help, and palliative care specialists are trained to spend time to pick the right medicine for your needs. One common side effect of treatment, especially radiation and hormone therapy, is fatigue. Your palliative care team may recommend exercise and other lifestyle changes that can give you more energy. They may also suggest drugs, changes in diet, physical therapy, or deep breathing to handle other side effects such as nausea, vomiting, trouble breathing, sleeping problems, and lack of appetite. Sometimes chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery are considered ""palliative"" because they ease pain by shrinking tumors. The goal of all of these is to make your life more comfortable. Palliative care extends far beyond the physical. Experts can recommend support groups and counselors to help you manage depression, fear, and anxiety. They can also help you open the doors of communication with your partner to talk about sensitive issues like sex. Chaplains and other palliative care professionals can discuss spiritual or religious issues. They can even help you achieve lifelong goals. Palliative care staffers helped one person with cancer, who regretted not marrying his fiancee, to tie the knot right at his bedside. If you decide to stop treatment and move into hospice care, a palliative care team can help with that as well. Your health may not be the only thing on your mind. You may also be worried about having enough money and navigating the insurance maze. You might need legal advice about wills and advanced directives. Members of your palliative care team can offer assistance directly or can tell you where to get financial and legal help. They can also tackle transportation and housing issues if you have family members visiting from out of town. Palliative care can also help your family, friends, and caregivers manage their stress.']",When can you get palliative care for prostate cancer?,"Palliative care is [92m""a big help at a time when you may be looking for relief from pain or new ways to deal with a swirl of intense feelings"" [1][0m.

Most hospitals have palliative services, and some have centers that you can visit without having to stay overnight. Your primary care doctor may also be involved in the palliative care you get. One of the most important goals of palliative care is easing the physical symptoms of the cancer itself and any side effects from treatment. Some of the prostate cancer symptoms you can get help with are: Trouble peeing or needing to pee often Problems with erections or ejaculation Loss of sex drive Pain in your lower back, hips, and upper thighs Different pain relief drugs can help, and palliative care specialists are trained to spend time to pick the right medicine for your needs. One common side effect of treatment, especially radiation and hormone therapy, is fatigue. Your palliative care team may recommend exercise and other lifestyle changes that can give you more energy. They may also suggest drugs, changes in diet, physical therapy, or deep breathing to handle other side effects such as nausea, vomiting, trouble breathing, sleeping problems, and lack of appetite. Sometimes chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery are considered ""palliative"" because they ease pain by shrinking tumors. The goal of all of these is to make your life more comfortable. Palliative care extends far beyond the physical. Experts can recommend support groups and counselors to help you manage depression, fear, and anxiety. They can also help you open the doors of communication with your partner to talk about sensitive issues like sex. Chaplains and other palliative care professionals can discuss spiritual or religious issues. They can even help you achieve lifelong goals. Palliative care staffers helped one person with cancer, who regretted not marrying his fiancee, to tie the knot right at his bedside. If you decide to stop treatment and move into hospice care, a palliative care team can help with that as well. Your health may not be the only thing on your mind. You may also be worried about having enough money and navigating the insurance maze. You might need legal advice about wills and advanced directives. Members of your palliative care team can offer assistance directly or can tell you where to get financial and legal help.

78,108,"[""https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adhd-in-the-workplace\nExcellent focus, attention to detail, speed, and organization -- they are all things employers are looking for in employees and job candidates. But when you have ADHD, these and more can be a real challenge. It can make it tough to excel at work and sometimes even keep a job. You may feel restless or not be able to focus -- classic parts of having the disorder. But there are things you can do to help you get a job and thrive despite your ADHD. Sometimes it can be an asset. An estimated 8 million to 9 million American adults have ADHD. And many other people in similar situations struggle on the job. One national survey showed that only half of adults with ADHD were able to hold down a full-time job, compared to 72% of adults without the disorder. When they were able to secure a job, they tended to earn less than their peers without it. Those job problems translate into nearly $77 billion in lost income each year. How much ADHD affects your job outlook depends on how severe your condition is. Some people \x1b[92m[1] may just have trouble staying on task, while others can't make it through the workday without getting into a huge blow-up with a boss or co-worker\x1b[0m. Some people who are \x1b[92m[2] more severely affected can lose their job, wind up bouncing from job to job, or need to seek disability benefits\x1b[0m. ADHD affects job performance in a number of ways. If you can't sit still and have trouble with organization and focus, you may find meetings excruciating. Keeping track of multiple projects and deadlines is enormously challenging. One study showed that people with ADHD often had more trouble with attention, working memory, mental processing, and verbal fluency. These are all called executive-function abilities that are important in the workplace. If you have ADHD, it may be hard to: Manage time Get and stay organized Listen and pay attention Follow directions Complete assignments Attend to details Get to work on time Speak just when it's your turn Sit still Keep emotions under control You may also have trouble with: Anger Procrastination ADHD often leads to depression and low self-esteem. When you can't make deadlines and aren't able to complete your work on schedule, it can make these feelings worse. Many adults who are restless, aren't able to concentrate, or have other symptoms have never been formally diagnosed with ADHD. If you have any of the problems listed above, the first step should be to see a doctor who specializes in the treatment of adult ADHD. They can talk to you to see if you do have it. And if you do, diagnose you so that you can get started on the right treatment plan. People have success with medication, therapy, or both. There are also organizational strategies you can learn from a coach or occupational therapist and then practice. If you are about to start a job search, work with a career counselor to find a job that best matches your interests, needs, and abilities. That might want to find a more fast-paced job with flexible hours and a less-rigid structure. Or you may want to start your own business so that you can design your own work environment and hours. Once you have a job, try these: Find peace. Ask to work in a quiet space where you won't be easily distracted. Buddy up. Work with a manager or colleague who is well-organized and can help guide you through projects from start to completion. Book it. Keep a day planner with a calendar and list of things to do. Update them often. Set up your PDA or computer to send you electronic reminders for meetings and due dates. Write it down. Take notes at meetings and during phone conversations, and add all new tasks to your to-do list. Schedule interruptions. Set aside specific periods of time each day for answering voice mail and email so that they won't interrupt your other responsibilities. Set realistic goals. Break up your days into a series of individual assignments, and only try to tackle one task at a time. Use a timer to let you know when to move on to the next task. Reward yourself. When you complete an assignment or follow through on these organizational tricks, find a way to reward yourself. Take a break to go for a walk. Read a magazine article. For big goals, go out for a special lunch or get yourself something you've been wanting. Delegate. If you can, get an assistant or intern to take care of the small details to free you up so you can focus on the big picture. Relax, and make it a habit. Practice relaxation techniques. They can help with concentration. Try mediation or deep breathing. Get up once an hour and take a walk, get a drink of water, or talk to a co-worker. To help you adjust to your job, enlist the help of a career counselor or executive coach. He or she can offer you guidance on any issues you encounter. They can also help you work through the job situations that you find most troublesome. For example, they could help you role play how to discuss a pay raise with your boss without the conversation becoming emotionally charged. Because ADHD is considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, \x1b[92m[3] if you work at a larger company, they can't discriminate against you on the basis of your condition\x1b[0m. The act also requires your company to \x1b[92m[4] accommodate your needs\x1b[0m. But you have to be comfortable enough to let your employer know that you have ADHD. It may be best to research this topic more before bringing it up so you have a plan. Finally, take advantage of the benefits -- yes, there are benefits -- that can come with ADHD. The restlessness, impulsiveness, and constant desire to try new things can be great assets. This is especially true if you have your own business. Studies have shown that many adults with ADHD wind up as entrepreneurs. The trick to success is to find a career that best suits you. Then use your energy, creativity, and other strengths to get the most out of your job.""]",Do I need disability benefits for ADHD?,"Some people with ADHD [92m""may just have trouble staying on task, while others can't make it through the workday without getting into a huge blow-up with a boss or co-worker"" [1][0m.

Some people who are more severely affected can lose their job, wind up bouncing from job to job, or need to seek disability benefits. ADHD affects job performance in a number of ways. If you can't sit still and have trouble with organization and focus, you may find meetings excruciating. Keeping track of multiple projects and deadlines is enormously challenging.

When you can't make deadlines and aren't able to complete your work on schedule, it can make these feelings worse. Many adults who are restless, aren't able to concentrate, or have other symptoms have never been formally diagnosed with ADHD. If you have any of the problems listed above, the first step should be to see a doctor who specializes in the treatment of adult ADHD. They can talk to you to see if you do have it. And if you do, diagnose you so that you can get started on the right treatment plan. People have success with medication, therapy, or both. There are also organizational strategies you can learn from a coach or occupational therapist and then practice. If you are about to start a job search, work with a career counselor to find a job that best matches your interests, needs, and abilities. That might want to find a more fast-paced job with flexible hours and a less-rigid structure. Or you may want to start your own business so that you can design your own work environment and hours. Once you have a job, try these: Find peace. Ask to work in a quiet space where you won't be easily distracted. Buddy up. Work with a manager or colleague who is well-organized and can help guide you through projects from start to completion. Book it. Keep a day planner with a calendar and list of things to do. Update them often. Set up your PDA or computer to send you electronic reminders for meetings and due dates. Write it down. Take notes at meetings and during phone conversations, and add all new tasks to your to-do list. Schedule interruptions. Set aside specific periods of time each day for answering voice mail and email so that they won't interrupt your other responsibilities. Set realistic goals. Break up your days into a series of individual assignments, and only try to tackle one task at a time. Use a timer to let you know when to move on to the next task. Reward yourself. When you complete an assignment or follow through on these organizational tricks, find a way to reward yourself. Take a break to go for a walk. Read a magazine article. For big goals, go out for a special lunch or get yourself something you've been wanting. Delegate. If you can, get an assistant or intern to take care of the small details to free you up so you can focus on the big picture. Relax, and make it a habit. Practice relaxation techniques.

To help you adjust to your job, enlist the help of a career counselor or executive coach. He or she can offer you guidance on any issues you encounter. They can also help you work through the job situations that you find most troublesome. For example, they could help you role play how to discuss a pay raise with your boss without the conversation becoming emotionally charged. Because ADHD is considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, if you work at a larger company, they can't discriminate against you on the basis of your condition.

The restlessness, impulsiveness, and constant desire to try new things can be great assets. This is especially true if you have your own business.

But when they take many medications at once, there's a higher chance they'll have a bad reaction to them. The problems can include confusion, agitation, sleepiness or sleeplessness, mood swings, memory problems, and upset stomach. Some people who have severe symptoms of Alzheimer's disease -- such as aggressive behavior or hallucinations (seeing, feeling, or hearing things that aren't there) √¢\x80\x93 may need stronger medicine to keep their problems under control. But some of these drugs can make their other Alzheimer's symptoms worse. For example: Some drugs such as tranquilizers can cause confusion, memory trouble, and slowed reactions, which can lead to falls. Some medicines that treat depression can cause sedation and other side effects. These drugs may react with medicines that treat Alzheimer's disease, including donepezil ( Aricept), galantamine ( Razadyne), memantine ( Namenda), and rivastigmine ( Exelon). Some medicines that treat hallucinations can cause sedation, confusion, and drops in blood pressure. Ask your doctor about the pros and cons of these options. Also, some over-the-counter drugs, including cough and cold remedies and sleep medicines, can have side effects, too. They may also react with other Alzheimer's meds. A doctor can let you know which ones are safe to take. Plan ahead. Think about his needs so you'll be ready for any changes or problems. You can try taking a short trip first to see how he reacts to traveling. A few other tips: Give him simple, relaxing things to do when you're traveling. He could read a magazine, play with a deck of cards, or listen to music, for examples. Never leave a person with dementia alone in a car. When moving, keep his seat belt buckled and the doors locked. Plan regular rest stops. If he gets agitated during the trip, stop at the first place you can. Don't try to calm him while you're driving. Think about going on vacation somewhere that's familiar to him -- like at a lake cabin he's visited in the past, for example. If he gets flustered easily, it may be wise to avoid places that are crowded. You may also want to skip fast-paced sightseeing trips. If he's never been on a plane, it may a good idea to drive instead, if possible. Alert the airlines and hotel staff that you're traveling with a relative who is memory-impaired. Make sure he carries or wears some sort of identification. Enjoy your time with your dad, but try to find time to relax, too. It may help to bring someone along who can help you with caregiving tasks. \x1b[92m[1] Her Alzheimer's symptoms can make it harder for her to get enough to eat\x1b[0m. She might have trouble knowing when she's hungry or thirsty, have problems eating or swallowing, have a hard time using silverware, or feel depressed. \x1b[92m[2] Try some of these tips: Talk to your loved one's doctor\x1b[0m. He may be able to help if she's not eating because of a treatable problem, like depression. \x1b[92m[3] Don't force her to eat\x1b[0m. If she's not interested in food, try to find out why. \x1b[92m[4] Focus on serving more nutritious choices, like protein, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, and less salt and sugar\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Offer smaller meals more often instead of three large ones\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Encourage her to walk, garden, or do other things that get her moving to boost her appetite\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Serve finger foods that are easier for her to handle and eat\x1b[0m. Prepare meals that offer different textures, colors, and temperatures. \x1b[92m[8] Make eating fun, not a chore\x1b[0m. For example, liven up your meals with colorful place settings, or play background music. \x1b[92m[9] Try not to let your loved one eat alone\x1b[0m. If you can't eat with her, invite a guest. \x1b[92m[10] Keep her surroundings and routine the same\x1b[0m. If you have to make changes, do it gradually. \x1b[92m[11] Make things simple, and avoid situations where she has to make decisions\x1b[0m. Describe the events for the day to her. Remind her of the date, day, time, place, etc. And repeat the names of the people she sees often. Put large labels (with words or pictures) on drawers and shelves so she'll know what's in or on them. If she doesn't seem to understand something you've said, use simpler words or sentences. Make sure she takes her medicines on schedule. Be patient and supportive. Losing cherished memories is one of the hardest parts of Alzheimer's disease. Some medicines may help slow down symptoms. There are also some ways to help her hold on to the things she does remember. Use notes, lists, and memos to remind her of her daily tasks. Keep photos of family members and friends where she can see them. Label them with names if you need to. Get her to talk about the people or the hobbies she used to enjoy. Make sure she gets enough sleep. Encourage her to read, do puzzles, write, or do other things that keep her mind active. But if she gets frustrated, don't push her to keep going. For many years, people thought this extract from the ginkgo tree might be a memory booster. But there's no evidence that it works in treating or preventing Alzheimer's. In fact, it may be harmful. One large study showed that taking it every day may cause dangerous side effects, such as too much bleeding, and that ginkgo does not slow the decline of cognition. Yes. Exercise improves strength and endurance and keeps the heart healthy. It can also give your loved one more energy and improve his mood and sleep. Physical activity also helps people with Alzheimer's disease keep up their motor skills and balance, which can help them avoid serious injuries from falls. It can make the brain work better, too. The type of exercise that's right for your loved one depends on how much the disease affects him. Someone in the early stages of the disease may enjoy walking, bowling, dancing, golf, and swimming. As the disease gets worse, he may need more supervision. Talk to his doctor before he starts any exercise program. Many people with the disease get confused, anxious, and agitated at dusk and into the evening hours. It's called sundown syndrome, or sundowning. The problems may last a few hours or throughout the night. Doctors don't know exactly what causes sundowning, but they think a lot of different things play a role. Those could include physical and mental exhaustion (after a long day), and a shift in the body's internal clock that happens with the change from daylight to dark. Some people with Alzheimer's have trouble sleeping at night, which may also make confusion worse. Some medications can add to the problem, too. Some ways for you and your loved one to handle sundowning: Schedule harder tasks early in the day when she's less likely to get agitated. Watch her diet and eating habits. Offer sweets and drinks with caffeine only in the morning hours. Serve her a late afternoon snack or early dinner. Offer her decaffeinated herbal tea or warm milk. They might help her relax. Keep the house or room well lit. Close the drapes before the sun goes down so she doesn't watch it get dark outside. If she falls asleep on the sofa or in a chair, let her stay there. Don't wake her to go to bed. Distract her with things she enjoys. Soothing music or a favorite video may help. Encourage her to be physically active during the day. It may help her to sleep better at night. No one has studied sexuality in Alzheimer's. But many people with disease also have a mood disorder, such as depression, or other medical problem, which can lead to sexual problems. Medications that treat these conditions can also affect someone's sex life. People with dementia often feel less interested in many areas of their lives, like their appearance, clothes, and friends. That may affect their sex drive, too. If your partner has Alzheimer's and you're concerned about their sexuality, try the following: Ask your loved one's doctor if she might have a mood disorder. Make sure she's getting treatment for any medical problems that may make her feel worse, like pain from arthritis. Ask her doctor how her medications might affect her sexuality.""]",What can I do to help my loved one with Alzheimer's disease to get the right amount of food to eat?,"To help a loved one with Alzheimer's disease get the right amount of food to eat, it's important to understand that [92m""Her Alzheimer's symptoms can make it harder for her to get enough to eat"" [1][0m.

Some people with Alzheimer's have trouble sleeping at night, which may also make confusion worse. Some medications can add to the problem, too. Some ways for you and your loved one to handle sundowning: Schedule harder tasks early in the day when she's less likely to get agitated. Watch her diet and eating habits. Offer sweets and drinks with caffeine only in the morning hours. Serve her a late afternoon snack or early dinner. Offer her decaffeinated herbal tea or warm milk. They might help her relax. Keep the house or room well lit. Close the drapes before the sun goes down so she doesn't watch it get dark outside. If she falls asleep on the sofa or in a chair, let her stay there. Don't wake her to go to bed. Distract her with things she enjoys. Soothing music or a favorite video may help. Encourage her to be physically active during the day. It may help her to sleep better at night. No one has studied sexuality in Alzheimer's. But many people with disease also have a mood disorder, such as depression, or other medical problem, which can lead to sexual problems. Medications that treat these conditions can also affect someone's sex life. People with dementia often feel less interested in many areas of their lives, like their appearance, clothes, and friends. That may affect their sex drive, too. If your partner has Alzheimer's and you're concerned about their sexuality, try the following: Ask your loved one's doctor if she might have a mood disorder. Make sure she's getting treatment for any medical problems that may make her feel worse, like pain from arthritis. Ask her doctor how her medications might affect her sexuality.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/guide/alzheimers-disease-frequently-asked-questions'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/guide/alzheimers-disease-frequently-asked-questions\nA person with Alzheimer's disease may be taking medicines to treat their symptoms and other health problems they have. But when they take many medications at once, there's a higher chance they'll have a bad reaction to them. The problems can include confusion, agitation, sleepiness or sleeplessness, mood swings, memory problems, and upset stomach. Some people who have severe symptoms of Alzheimer's disease -- such as aggressive behavior or hallucinations (seeing, feeling, or hearing things that aren't there) √¢\x80\x93 may need stronger medicine to keep their problems under control. But some of these drugs can make their other Alzheimer's symptoms worse. For example: Some drugs such as tranquilizers can cause confusion, memory trouble, and slowed reactions, which can lead to falls. Some medicines that treat depression can cause sedation and other side effects. These drugs may react with medicines that treat Alzheimer's disease, including donepezil ( Aricept), galantamine ( Razadyne), memantine ( Namenda), and rivastigmine ( Exelon). Some medicines that treat hallucinations can cause sedation, confusion, and drops in blood pressure. Ask your doctor about the pros and cons of these options. Also, some over-the-counter drugs, including cough and cold remedies and sleep medicines, can have side effects, too. They may also react with other Alzheimer's meds. A doctor can let you know which ones are safe to take. Plan ahead. Think about his needs so you'll be ready for any changes or problems. You can try taking a short trip first to see how he reacts to traveling. A few other tips: Give him simple, relaxing things to do when you're traveling. He could read a magazine, play with a deck of cards, or listen to music, for examples. Never leave a person with dementia alone in a car. When moving, keep his seat belt buckled and the doors locked. Plan regular rest stops. If he gets agitated during the trip, stop at the first place you can. Don't try to calm him while you're driving. Think about going on vacation somewhere that's familiar to him -- like at a lake cabin he's visited in the past, for example. If he gets flustered easily, it may be wise to avoid places that are crowded. You may also want to skip fast-paced sightseeing trips. If he's never been on a plane, it may a good idea to drive instead, if possible. Alert the airlines and hotel staff that you're traveling with a relative who is memory-impaired. Make sure he carries or wears some sort of identification. Enjoy your time with your dad, but try to find time to relax, too. It may help to bring someone along who can help you with caregiving tasks. \x1b[92m[1] Her Alzheimer's symptoms can make it harder for her to get enough to eat\x1b[0m.

Remind her of the date, day, time, place, etc. And repeat the names of the people she sees often. Put large labels (with words or pictures) on drawers and shelves so she'll know what's in or on them. If she doesn't seem to understand something you've said, use simpler words or sentences. Make sure she takes her medicines on schedule. Be patient and supportive. Losing cherished memories is one of the hardest parts of Alzheimer's disease. Some medicines may help slow down symptoms. There are also some ways to help her hold on to the things she does remember. Use notes, lists, and memos to remind her of her daily tasks. Keep photos of family members and friends where she can see them. Label them with names if you need to. Get her to talk about the people or the hobbies she used to enjoy. Make sure she gets enough sleep. Encourage her to read, do puzzles, write, or do other things that keep her mind active. But if she gets frustrated, don't push her to keep going. For many years, people thought this extract from the ginkgo tree might be a memory booster. But there's no evidence that it works in treating or preventing Alzheimer's. In fact, it may be harmful. One large study showed that taking it every day may cause dangerous side effects, such as too much bleeding, and that ginkgo does not slow the decline of cognition. Yes. Exercise improves strength and endurance and keeps the heart healthy. It can also give your loved one more energy and improve his mood and sleep. Physical activity also helps people with Alzheimer's disease keep up their motor skills and balance, which can help them avoid serious injuries from falls. It can make the brain work better, too. The type of exercise that's right for your loved one depends on how much the disease affects him. Someone in the early stages of the disease may enjoy walking, bowling, dancing, golf, and swimming. As the disease gets worse, he may need more supervision. Talk to his doctor before he starts any exercise program. Many people with the disease get confused, anxious, and agitated at dusk and into the evening hours. It's called sundown syndrome, or sundowning. The problems may last a few hours or throughout the night. Doctors don't know exactly what causes sundowning, but they think a lot of different things play a role. Those could include physical and mental exhaustion (after a long day), and a shift in the body's internal clock that happens with the change from daylight to dark.

Therefore, it is very important that you have regular eye exams. Your doctor will perform a series of painless tests -- eye pressure measurements, dilated eye exams, and sometimes visual field testing and other tests -- to check for any changes in your eye or in your vision. With early detection, glaucoma can often be controlled with medications, such as eye drops. If your glaucoma doesn't respond to medication, your doctor may also recommend surgery. Remember, because glaucoma is painless, about half of people who have it don't know they have it. You can't get your vision back once it is lost. Your best protection is to get regular eye exams, every couple of years if you are over 40 or on a schedule recommended by your doctor. The chances are good that you will not go blind if you take your medication correctly and regularly and follow up with your doctor. Treatment significantly slows the damage that occurs to the optic nerve because of the high pressure in the eye. In fact, if you take your eye drops on schedule each day, you'll probably keep your eyesight until the day you die of old age! Not necessarily, but it does increase your risk. Other factors that may increase your risk are: Being over age 50 Being over age 40 and African- American Having a family history of glaucoma Having a history of serious eye injury Taking steroid medications Having diabetes Being nearsighted Having high blood pressure People with these risk factors should have their eyes examined on a regular basis to look for the disease. Yes. There are many different types of medications (in eye drops or pills) that are used to treat glaucoma. Typically, the doctor will start you on an eye drop formula. The medications work two ways: Some decrease how much fluid is produced in the eye; others help the fluid flow out better. Many people can preserve their vision if they take their medications as scheduled and visit their doctor regularly. Note: Medications for glaucoma -- even eye drops -- can affect the entire body, so you should alert all of your doctors that you are taking them, as well as report all of your medical conditions to your eye doctor. In some people, however, drugs alone do not control the eye pressure, and surgery is needed. One type of surgery called laser trabeculoplasty uses a laser to improve the flow of fluids out of the eye. This can be done in your doctor's office. There are also several conventional surgeries -- the most common is called trabeculectomy -- in which your doctor creates a new drainage path in the eye under the eyelid. This surgery must be done in an operating room. After both of these procedures, people may still have to take eye drops to further lower the eye pressure. Studies performed in the 1970s reported that smoking marijuana could lower eye pressure. Other studies have been inconclusive. Newer reviews by the National Eye Institute and the Institute of Medicine show that there is no scientific evidence that marijuana is more effective than the drugs currently available. Most people with glaucoma can still drive -- as long as they pass the Department of Motor Vehicles' vision test. Simply put, your ability to drive will depend on how much vision has been lost. Some people with advanced glaucoma can still get their license renewed but with restrictions.

Being diagnosed with glaucoma is scary. Many older people are dealing with several problems that come with age. They often worry that they will become a burden to the family if they lose their vision. So, first, reassure your parent that many people keep their vision with proper medication and care. Next, help your loved one establish a routine so eye drops are applied correctly on schedule. Some eye drops must be applied several times a day. This can be especially difficult for people with arthritis, and, frankly, not an easy task for anyone to remember!

81,128,"[""https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/surgery-disc-replacement-fusion\nThe vast majority of people -- more than 90% -- with pain from cervical disc disease will get better on their own over time with simple, conservative treatments. Surgery, however, may help if other treatments fail or if symptoms worsen. Cervical disc disease is caused by an abnormality in one or more discs -- the cushions -- that lie between the neck bones (vertebrae). When a disc is damaged -- due to arthritis or an unknown cause -- it can lead to neck pain from inflammation or muscle spasm. In severe cases, pain and numbness can occur in the arms from pressure on the cervical nerve roots. Surgery for cervical disc disease typically involves removing the disc that is pinching the nerve or pressing on the spinal cord. This surgery is called a discectomy. Depending on where the disc is located, the surgeon can remove it through a small incision either in the front (anterior discectomy) or back (posterior discectomy) of the neck while you are under anesthesia. A similar technique, microdiscectomy, removes the disc through a smaller incision using a microscope or other magnifying device. Often, a procedure is performed to close the space that's left when the disc is removed and restore the spine to its original length. Patients have two options: Artificial cervical disc replacement Cervical fusion In 2007, the FDA approved the first artificial disc, the Prestige Cervical disc, which looks and moves much like the real thing but is made of metal. Since then, several artificial cervical discs have been developed and approved. Ongoing research has shown that the artificial disc can improve neck and arm pain as safely and effectively as cervical fusion while allowing for range of motion that is as good or better than with cervical fusion. People who get the artificial disc are often able to return to work more quickly as well. The surgery to replace the disc, however, does take longer and can lead to more blood loss than with cervical fusion. It's also not known how the artificial discs will last over time. People who get an artificial disc can always opt for cervical fusion later. But if a patient has cervical fusion first, it's not possible to later put an artificial disc in the same spot. Not everyone is a candidate for the artificial disc, however. Those with osteoporosis, joint disease, infection, inflammation at the site, or an allergy to stainless steel may not be candidates for disc replacement surgery. With cervical fusion surgery, the surgeon removes the damaged disc and places a bone graft (which is taken either from the patient's hip or from a cadaver) in the space between the vertebrae. The bone graft will eventually fuse to the vertebrae above and below it. A metal plate may be screwed into the vertebrae above and below the graft to hold the bone in place while it heals and fuses with the vertebrae. Discectomy with cervical fusion can often help relieve the pain of spinal disc disease. The only caveat is that after the surgery, many people find that they lose some degree of movement in their neck. Although cervical disc surgery is generally safe, it does have a few risks, including: Infection Excessive bleeding Reaction to anesthesia Chronic neck pain Damage to the nerves, spinal cord, esophagus, or vocal cords Failure to heal After cervical fusion surgery, some people develop cervical disc problems above and/or below the previously affected disc.

Surgery, however, may help if other treatments fail or if symptoms worsen. Cervical disc disease is caused by an abnormality in one or more discs -- the cushions -- that lie between the neck bones (vertebrae). When a disc is damaged -- due to arthritis or an unknown cause -- it can lead to neck pain from inflammation or muscle spasm. In severe cases, pain and numbness can occur in the arms from pressure on the cervical nerve roots. Surgery for cervical disc disease typically involves removing the disc that is pinching the nerve or pressing on the spinal cord. This surgery is called a discectomy. Depending on where the disc is located, the surgeon can remove it through a small incision either in the front (anterior discectomy) or back (posterior discectomy) of the neck while you are under anesthesia. A similar technique, microdiscectomy, removes the disc through a smaller incision using a microscope or other magnifying device. Often, a procedure is performed to close the space that's left when the disc is removed and restore the spine to its original length. Patients have two options: Artificial cervical disc replacement Cervical fusion In 2007, the FDA approved the first artificial disc, the Prestige Cervical disc, which looks and moves much like the real thing but is made of metal. Since then, several artificial cervical discs have been developed and approved.

People who get the artificial disc are often able to return to work more quickly as well. The surgery to replace the disc, however, does take longer and can lead to more blood loss than with cervical fusion. It's also not known how the artificial discs will last over time. People who get an artificial disc can always opt for cervical fusion later. But if a patient has cervical fusion first, it's not possible to later put an artificial disc in the same spot.

The combination of skin flare-ups and joint pain is known as psoriatic arthritis. If you're not sure if you have it, talk to your doctor. Psoriatic arthritis usually hits joints like your knees, fingers, toes, and back. When you get flare-ups there, it may be tough to do everyday tasks. But you can still look your best. These tips and tricks can make your self-care routine easier and more enjoyable: 1. Start with a warm shower. Heat boosts blood flow. That can help ease stiff, painful joints. You may feel less sore and more flexible if you shower before starting your day. If you have psoriasis plaques on your skin, don't take a super long or hot shower. That can make skin flare-ups worse. 2. Get comfortable. As you get ready to do your hair and makeup, think about how you're feeling. For example, if your hips or knees hurt, try sitting down in front of a mirror rather than standing in front of a sink vanity. 3. Give yourself time. If you're rushing, you're more likely to move in ways that cause more pain. Build in extra time in the morning so you can move at a speed that feels good. 4. But look for shortcuts. If you blow-dry your hair, towel or air-dry it as long as possible so you don't have to hold the blow dryer as long. In the shower, \x1b[92m[1] use a moisturizing body wash so you don't have apply moisturizer again when you get out of the shower\x1b[0m. 5. Choose \x1b[92m[2] easy-to-use products\x1b[0m.

83,198,"[""https://www.webmd.com/beauty/thinning-hair\nSo you're never going to have a thick, lush head of hair again. But at least you'd like to hang on to what you've got. Short of a transplant, is there anything you can do to stop thinning hair? Yes. \x1b[92m[1] With some treatments, you can slow down or stop hair thinning -- and maybe even grow back some hair you thought was gone forever\x1b[0m. Read on to see what works and what doesn't. This is \x1b[92m[2] the only over-the-counter medication for hair loss approved by the FDA for use by both men and women\x1b[0m. It won't rescue a receding hairline. It does stimulate hair growth, although scientists aren't quite sure how it works. Minoxidil is available as Rogaine or Theroxidil, or in generic form. It's sold as a liquid or foam and in two strengths: 2% and 5%. Effectiveness: \x1b[92m[4] Minoxidil works for about 2 out of 3 men\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] It's most effective if you're under age 40 and have only recently started to lose your hair\x1b[0m. How to use it: Twice a day, when your hair is dry, apply minoxidil on your scalp where the hair has started to thin. Then be patient. You may not notice changes for 4 months or more. What it doesn't do: Minoxidil does not cure baldness. If you stop using it, you will start losing hair again. Your hair may fall out faster than before. Side effects: You may have redness, itching, dryness, flaking, or other scalp irritation, though this is uncommon. It's more likely if you use the stronger 5% solution. This medication \x1b[92m[6] stops your body from making the hormone at the root of male pattern baldness, DHT (dihydrotestosterone)\x1b[0m. It is available under the brand name Propecia. Effectiveness: Finasteride is \x1b[92m[7] very effective\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] It slows or stops hair loss in nearly 90% of men\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] About two-thirds of these men also regrow some hair\x1b[0m. How to use it: Finasteride is a pill. Usually, you take it once a day. Your dermatologist may recommend using it in combination with minoxidil. What it doesn't do: Like minoxidil, it doesn't cure hair loss. If you stop taking it, you will lose hair again. Side effects: \x1b[92m[10] Finasteride can cause erectile dysfunction and other sexual side effects, though this is unusual\x1b[0m. If it happens to you, it will likely clear up once you stop taking finasteride. But for some men, that can take 3 months or more. Biotin is a B vitamin that is essential for your health. You most likely get plenty of it in your diet in egg yolks, yeast, liver, and other foods. That's good news because too little biotin can cause hair loss. Does that mean that taking mega-doses of it will give you more hair? Probably not. No scientific studies have shown biotin to prevent or treat hair loss. You may have heard that laser combs, brushes, hoods, and caps can help halt hair loss. The theory is that when hair follicles absorb laser light at a certain level, it stimulates hair to grow. But there's not enough evidence that any of these devices restore hair or prevent balding. If you lose hair suddenly, see your doctor. It may be caused by illnesses, medicine, or low levels of iron or vitamin D.""]",Can you fix thinning hair?,"To fix thinning hair, [92m""With some treatments, you can slow down or stop hair thinning -- and maybe even grow back some hair you thought was gone forever"" [1][0m.

This is the only over-the-counter medication for hair loss approved by the FDA for use by both men and women. It won't rescue a receding hairline. It does stimulate hair growth, although scientists aren't quite sure how it works. Minoxidil is available as Rogaine or Theroxidil, or in generic form. It's sold as a liquid or foam and in two strengths: 2% and 5%. Effectiveness: Minoxidil works for about 2 out of 3 men. It's most effective if you're under age 40 and have only recently started to lose your hair. How to use it: Twice a day, when your hair is dry, apply minoxidil on your scalp where the hair has started to thin. Then be patient. You may not notice changes for 4 months or more. What it doesn't do: Minoxidil does not cure baldness. If you stop using it, you will start losing hair again. Your hair may fall out faster than before. Side effects: You may have redness, itching, dryness, flaking, or other scalp irritation, though this is uncommon. It's more likely if you use the stronger 5% solution. This medication stops your body from making the hormone at the root of male pattern baldness, DHT (dihydrotestosterone). It is available under the brand name Propecia. Effectiveness: Finasteride is very effective. It slows or stops hair loss in nearly 90% of men. About two-thirds of these men also regrow some hair. How to use it: Finasteride is a pill. Usually, you take it once a day. Your dermatologist may recommend using it in combination with minoxidil. What it doesn't do: Like minoxidil, it doesn't cure hair loss. If you stop taking it, you will lose hair again. Side effects: Finasteride can cause erectile dysfunction and other sexual side effects, though this is unusual. If it happens to you, it will likely clear up once you stop taking finasteride. But for some men, that can take 3 months or more. Biotin is a B vitamin that is essential for your health. You most likely get plenty of it in your diet in egg yolks, yeast, liver, and other foods. That's good news because too little biotin can cause hair loss. Does that mean that taking mega-doses of it will give you more hair? Probably not. No scientific studies have shown biotin to prevent or treat hair loss. You may have heard that laser combs, brushes, hoods, and caps can help halt hair loss. The theory is that when hair follicles absorb laser light at a certain level, it stimulates hair to grow. But there's not enough evidence that any of these devices restore hair or prevent balding. If you lose hair suddenly, see your doctor.

84,202,"[""https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/shoulder-replacement-surgery-what-to-know\nIf your shoulder joint gets seriously damaged, you might need surgery to replace it. Before you have your procedure, you should know some things. The joint where your upper arm connects to your body is a ball-and-socket joint. The bone in your upper arm, called the humerus, has a round end that fits into the curved structure on the outside of your shoulder blade. Ligaments and tendons hold it together. Ligaments connect the bones, while tendons connect muscles to the bone. A layer of tissue called cartilage keeps the bones apart, so they don't rub against each other. The ball and socket lets you move your arm up and down, back and forward, or in a circle. You may have to have it done if you have a condition that makes it painful and hard to use your arm, such as: A serious shoulder injury like a broken bone Severe arthritis A torn rotator cuff Your doctor will probably try to treat you with drugs or physical therapy first. If those don't work, he may recommend surgery. Shoulder replacement surgery is less common than hip or knee replacements. But more than 50,000 shoulder replacements are done in the U. S. each year. An orthopedic surgeon will replace the natural bone in the ball and socket of your shoulder joint with a material that could be metal or plastic. It's a major surgery that'll keep you in the hospital for several days. You'll also need several weeks of physical therapy afterward. There are three types of shoulder replacement surgeries: Total shoulder replacement: This is the most common type. It replaces the ball at the top of your humerus with a metal ball, which gets attached to the remaining bone. The socket gets covered with a new plastic surface. Partial shoulder replacement: Only the ball gets replaced. Reverse shoulder replacement: Usually, you'd get this if you have a torn rotator cuff. It's also done when another shoulder replacement surgery didn't work. The metal ball gets attached to your shoulder bones, and a socket is implanted at the top of your arm. Before you get your new shoulder, \x1b[92m[1] you'll likely get a full physical exam and X-rays or other imaging tests so the surgeon can get a look at the joint\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Talk to your doctor about any other conditions you have and any medications you take\x1b[0m. You'll have to \x1b[92m[3] stop taking certain drugs, especially narcotic painkillers, several weeks before surgery\x1b[0m. You may have to cut back on drinking and get more exercise, too. \x1b[92m[4] If you smoke, you'll be asked to quit\x1b[0m. Scientists have found folks who smoke are more likely to have complications from joint replacement surgery than those who don't. \x1b[92m[5] Don't eat or drink anything after midnight on the night before your operation\x1b[0m. The procedure takes about 3 hours. Doctors will give you drugs to put you under during the surgery. You'll want to \x1b[92m[6] be sure you have some help with your daily routine lined up for a few weeks after you come home from the hospital\x1b[0m. You won't be able to move your arm very much. If you don't have a relative or friend who can help you out, you might want to check into a rehabilitation center until you can do more things on your own. \x1b[92m[7] You may also want to move some things around at home to make them easier to get to while you recover\x1b[0m. You can expect to spend 2 to 5 days in the hospital after your operation before going home. Your shoulder will swell, and it will hurt. Your doctor will prescribe drugs to help you manage the pain. Cold compresses can help control the swelling. At first, your arm will be in a brace to keep it from moving. Within a day or so, you'll start physical therapy to get your arm and your new shoulder working. You'll keep doing physical therapy after you go home. You'll do exercises that will gradually improve how your new joint works. Don't rush things: It may take 4 weeks before you can pick up anything heavier than a glass of water. Your arm will be in a sling for most of your recovery. It may be 6 weeks or more before you can drive again. In the year after your surgery, you'll have several follow-up visits with your doctor so she can see how your recovery is going. Most people have full motion in their shoulder and return to their daily routine after joint replacement surgery. But as with any operation, there's a chance of complications. These may include: Infection or bleeding around the joint: You'll probably get antibiotics after your surgery to lower your chances of an infection. Dislocation: This happens when the ball slips out of the socket. Nerves around your shoulder may get damaged during surgery: They usually recover. After years of use, the replacement joint may become loose or separate from the bone: You may need surgery to fix it.""]",How should you prepare for shoulder replacement surgery?,"Before shoulder replacement surgery, [92m""you'll likely get a full physical exam and X-rays or other imaging tests so the surgeon can get a look at the joint"" [1][0m.

Both can be helped by seeing a speech pathologist or speech therapist. In particular, the Lee Silverman Voice Therapy Program, has demonstrated significant value for people with Parkinson\'s. Ask your doctor about a referral to a speech pathologist experienced in administering the Lee Silverman Voice Therapy program. Speech-language pathologists can help people with Parkinson\'s disease maintain as many communication skills as possible. They also teach techniques that conserve energy, including non-verbal communication skills. Speech-language pathologists are also available to: Recommend appropriate communication technologies that will help with daily activities. Treat all types of speech, language, and communication problems. Evaluate swallowing function and recommend changes as necessary. Choose an environment with reduced noise. It can be tiring to try to ""talk over"" the television or radio. Speak slowly. Be certain your listener can see your face. Look at the person while you are talking. A well-lit room enhances face-to-face conversation, increasing understanding. Use short phrases. Say one or two words or syllables per breath. Over-articulate your speech by prolonging the vowels and exaggerating the consonants. Choose a comfortable posture and position that provide support during long and stressful conversations. Be aware that exercises intended to strengthen weakening muscles may be counter-productive. Always ask your speech therapist which exercises are right for you. Plan periods of vocal rest before planned conversations or phone calls. Know that fatigue significantly affects your speaking ability. Techniques that work in the morning may not work later in the day. If you are soft spoken and your voice has become low, consider using an amplifier. If some people have difficulty understanding you, the following strategies may help: If you are able to write without difficulty, always carry a paper and pen as a backup so you can write down what you are trying to say. If writing is difficult, use an alphabet board to point or scan to the first letter of the words that are spoken. Spell words out loud or on an alphabet board if they are not understood. Establish the topic before speaking. Use telegraphic speech. Leave out unnecessary words to communicate the meaning of the topic. Nonverbal communication, also called \x1b[92m[1] augmentative and alternative communication ( AAC), is a method of communicating without spoken word\x1b[0ms. When communication needs cannot be met through speech, the following techniques can help: Make the best use out of what speaking ability is left. Use expressions and gestures to communicate. Non-verbal communication \x1b[92m[3] can help people with speech difficulties actually speak better by: Reducing the frustration and stress of being unable to communicate\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Alleviating the pressure to speak\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Allowing the person to be more relaxed and come across in a more understandable manner\x1b[0m. Here\'s a sample of the devices that are available to help people with Parkinson\'s disease communicate more clearly. Palatal lift. A dental apparatus that is similar to a retainer. It lifts the soft palate and stops air from escaping out of the nose during speech. Amplification. A personal amplifier can be used to increase the volume of the voice. The amplifier also decreases voice fatigue. TTY telephone relay system. A telephone equipped with a keyboard so speech can be typed and read by a relay operator to the listener. Either the whole message can be typed or just the words that are not understood can be typed. Low technology devices.

This is especially important if your doctor recommends that you monitor your blood pressure on a regular basis. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } There are certain factors that can cause blood pressure to temporarily rise. For example, blood pressure normally rises as a result of: Stress Smoking Cold temperatures Exercise Caffeine Certain medicines Try to avoid as many of these factors as you can when taking your blood pressure. Also, try to measure your blood pressure at about the same time each day. Your doctor may want you to check your blood pressure several times during the day to see if it fluctuates. \x1b[92m[1] Find a quiet place to check your blood pressure\x1b[0m. You will need to listen for your heartbeat. \x1b[92m[2] Make sure that you are comfortable and relaxed with a recently emptied bladder (a full bladder may affect your reading)\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Roll up the sleeve on your arm or remove any tight-sleeved clothing\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Rest in a chair next to a table for 5 to 10 minutes\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Your arm should rest comfortably at heart level\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Sit up straight with your back against the chair, legs uncrossed\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Rest your forearm on the table with the palm of your hand facing up\x1b[0m. If you purchase a manual or digital blood pressure monitor (sphygmomanometer), follow the instruction booklet carefully. The following steps provide an overview of how to take your left arm blood pressure on either a manual or digital blood pressure monitor. Simply reverse the sides to take a blood pressure in your right arm. 1. Locate your pulse Locate your pulse by lightly pressing your index and middle fingers slightly to the inside center of the bend of your elbow (where the brachial artery is). If you cannot locate your pulse, place the head of the stethoscope (on a manual monitor) or the arm cuff (on a digital monitor) in the same general area. 2. Secure the cuff Slide the cuff onto your arm, making sure that the stethoscope head is over the artery (when using a manual monitor.) The cuff may be marked with an arrow to show the location of the stethoscope head. The lower edge of the cuff should be about 1 inch above the bend of your elbow. Use the fabric fastener to make the cuff snug, but not too tight. Place the stethoscope in your ears. Tilt the ear pieces slightly forward to get the best sound. 3. Inflate and deflate the cuff If you are using a manual monitor: Hold the pressure gauge in your left hand and the bulb in your right. Close the airflow valve on the bulb by turning the screw clockwise. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb with your right hand. You may hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Watch the gauge. Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads about 30 points (mm Hg) above your expected systolic pressure. At this point, you should not hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Keeping your eyes on the gauge, slowly release the pressure in the cuff by opening the airflow valve counterclockwise. The gauge should fall only 2 to 3 points with each heartbeat. ( You may need to practice turning the valve slowly.) Listen carefully for the first pulse beat. As soon as you hear it, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats). Continue to slowly deflate the cuff. Listen carefully until the sound disappears. As soon as you can no longer hear your pulse, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats). Allow the cuff to completely deflate. You'll get the most accurate reading if your arm is held straight. \x1b[92m[8] If you released the pressure too quickly or could not hear your pulse, DO NOT inflate the cuff again right away\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] Wait one minute before repeating the measurement\x1b[0m. Start by reapplying the cuff. If you are using a digital monitor: Hold the bulb in your right hand. Press the power button. All display symbols should appear briefly, followed by a zero. This indicates that the monitor is ready. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb with your right hand. If you have a monitor with automatic cuff inflation, press the start button. Watch the gauge. Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads about 30 points (mm Hg) above your expected systolic pressure. Sit quietly and watch the monitor. Pressure readings will be displayed on the screen. For some devices, values may appear on the left, then on the right. Wait for a long beep. This means that the measurement is complete. Note the pressures on the display screen. Systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats) appears on the left and diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats) on the right. Your pulse rate may also be displayed in between or after this reading. Allow the cuff to deflate. If you did not get an accurate reading, DO NOT inflate the cuff again right away. \x1b[92m[9] Wait one minute before repeating the measurement\x1b[0m. Start by reapplying the cuff. 4. Record your blood pressure. \x1b[92m[10] Follow your doctor's instructions on when and how often you should measure your blood pressure\x1b[0m.

Also, try to measure your blood pressure at about the same time each day. Your doctor may want you to check your blood pressure several times during the day to see if it fluctuates. Find a quiet place to check your blood pressure. You will need to listen for your heartbeat. Make sure that you are comfortable and relaxed with a recently emptied bladder (a full bladder may affect your reading). Roll up the sleeve on your arm or remove any tight-sleeved clothing. Rest in a chair next to a table for 5 to 10 minutes. Your arm should rest comfortably at heart level. Sit up straight with your back against the chair, legs uncrossed. Rest your forearm on the table with the palm of your hand facing up. If you purchase a manual or digital blood pressure monitor (sphygmomanometer), follow the instruction booklet carefully. The following steps provide an overview of how to take your left arm blood pressure on either a manual or digital blood pressure monitor. Simply reverse the sides to take a blood pressure in your right arm. 1. Locate your pulse Locate your pulse by lightly pressing your index and middle fingers slightly to the inside center of the bend of your elbow (where the brachial artery is). If you cannot locate your pulse, place the head of the stethoscope (on a manual monitor) or the arm cuff (on a digital monitor) in the same general area. 2. Secure the cuff Slide the cuff onto your arm, making sure that the stethoscope head is over the artery (when using a manual monitor.) The cuff may be marked with an arrow to show the location of the stethoscope head. The lower edge of the cuff should be about 1 inch above the bend of your elbow. Use the fabric fastener to make the cuff snug, but not too tight. Place the stethoscope in your ears. Tilt the ear pieces slightly forward to get the best sound. 3. Inflate and deflate the cuff If you are using a manual monitor: Hold the pressure gauge in your left hand and the bulb in your right. Close the airflow valve on the bulb by turning the screw clockwise. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb with your right hand. You may hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Watch the gauge. Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads about 30 points (mm Hg) above your expected systolic pressure. At this point, you should not hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Keeping your eyes on the gauge, slowly release the pressure in the cuff by opening the airflow valve counterclockwise. The gauge should fall only 2 to 3 points with each heartbeat. ( You may need to practice turning the valve slowly.) Listen carefully for the first pulse beat. As soon as you hear it, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats). Continue to slowly deflate the cuff. Listen carefully until the sound disappears. As soon as you can no longer hear your pulse, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats). Allow the cuff to completely deflate. You'll get the most accurate reading if your arm is held straight. If you released the pressure too quickly or could not hear your pulse, DO NOT inflate the cuff again right away. Wait one minute before repeating the measurement. Start by reapplying the cuff. If you are using a digital monitor: Hold the bulb in your right hand. Press the power button. All display symbols should appear briefly, followed by a zero. This indicates that the monitor is ready. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb with your right hand. If you have a monitor with automatic cuff inflation, press the start button. Watch the gauge. Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads about 30 points (mm Hg) above your expected systolic pressure. Sit quietly and watch the monitor. Pressure readings will be displayed on the screen. For some devices, values may appear on the left, then on the right. Wait for a long beep. This means that the measurement is complete. Note the pressures on the display screen. Systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats) appears on the left and diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats) on the right. Your pulse rate may also be displayed in between or after this reading. Allow the cuff to deflate. If you did not get an accurate reading, DO NOT inflate the cuff again right away. Wait one minute before repeating the measurement. Start by reapplying the cuff. 4. Record your blood pressure. Follow your doctor's instructions on when and how often you should measure your blood pressure. Record the date, time, systolic and diastolic pressures. You should also record any special circumstances like any recent exercise, meal, or stressful event.

Can unconventional treatments work? Alternative treatments for ADHD include elimination diets, supplementation with omegas 3s, parent training, neurofeedback, and memory training. Here\'s what may work and what\'s unproven. There\'s a lot of controversy about sugar and ADHD symptoms. Does it lead to hyperactivity? There is no proof that sugar causes ADHD. Then why do kids seem so hyper if they eat a lot of sugar? Research does show that refined sugar and carbohydrates can affect your child\'s activity level. Kids can feel a rush because refined sugar quickly enters the bloodstream. That boosts blood sugar fast. When blood sugar spikes, your child may become much more active. The burst of energy is from an adrenaline rush caused by the rise in blood sugar. So what can you do? \x1b[92m[1] Nutritionists say to add more fiber to your child\'s diet to help keep blood sugar levels even\x1b[0m. High-fiber foods include \x1b[92m[2] berries and other fruits, whole grains, and oatmeal\x1b[0m. Years ago, Ben Feingold, MD, an allergist, created a popular elimination diet designed to treat hyperactivity. With elimination diets for ADHD, you take certain foods out of your child\'s diet to see if they affect your child\'s behavior. The Feingold Diet cuts out artificial colorings, flavorings, and preservatives to decrease hyperactivity. While most scientific studies have disproved Feingold\'s theory, some parents who have tried it say they noticed an improvement in their child\'s behavior. But some experts don\'t think it\'s the changes in what the children eat that makes a difference. A popular theory is that the child\'s behavior improves because the parents treat their child differently when they\'re on the special diet. If you decide to try an elimination diet for ADHD, be careful. You don\'t want to hurt your child\'s overall nutrition and have them miss out on important vitamins or minerals. Don\'t be too restrictive. It\'s best to talk with your child\'s doctor before trying any ADHD treatment. She can help you make a healthy eating plan for your child. Or she can refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you with a meal plan and snack ideas. It\'s important to consider what your child will be able to eat when he or she is away from home, like at school, a birthday party, summer camp, or a friend\'s house. This can make a restrictive diet harder to follow. Also, consider whether the whole family, including siblings, will follow the same restrictions. One nutrition move that has shown promise is taking omega-3 supplements. Research has shown that children with ADHD have lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood than the typical child. As a result, some doctors recommend that they take omega-3 supplements. Children who were given omega-3s showed a small improvement in how severe their symptoms were when compared to children who took a placebo. The FDA has approved Vayarin, a ""medical food"" containing omega-3s, for treating ADHD. Research has shown that children as young as preschool-age can benefit from behavior programs. Programs that involve parents have the best success. Some chiropractors believe that chiropractic medicine can treat ADHD. But no research has been done to see if it works. Many ADHD doctors do not support it. One theory is that an imbalance in muscle tone causes an imbalance in brain activity. According to this theory, when chiropractors adjust the ADHD patient\'s spine, balance is restored in the brain. The children are also exposed to different light and sound frequencies. Applied kinesiology, or neural organization technique, is another theory some chiropractors use with people who have ADHD. It\'s based on the thought that the bones of the skull can become misaligned, causing unequal pressure on different parts of the brain. They say this causes the brain to work improperly. To treat it, the chiropractor does adjustments that put the skull bones back to their proper position. But most doctors believe the bones of the skull do not move, so they cannot be misaligned. Neurofeedback teaches a person with ADHD how to change brain waves to focus better. Scientists can study these to look for patterns. There are four waves the brain makes: alpha (medium), beta (fast), theta (slow), and delta (deep sleep). Neurofeedback is based on findings that people with ADHD have more theta waves than other people. They also have fewer beta waves. Supporters believe that training the brain to increase the fast beta waves and decrease the slow theta waves can lower ADHD symptoms. To train them, a medical professional watches the brain waves of the person with ADHD. When their brainwaves reach the right frequency, the health professional lets them know. Through training and practice, they can ultimately learn how to change brain waves on their own. While there has been some promising research in this area, more research is needed to see how well neurofeedback works on ADHD symptoms. A big drawback is the high cost of the treatment. Working Memory Training ( COGMED) Many people with ADHD have trouble with working memory. That\'s remembering information and doing things with it over a short amount of time. Using computer programs to do brain training seems to help people improve their ability to concentrate, control impulsive behaviors, and improve problem-solving skills. Several studies seem to point to some programs making a difference over the short term. But other studies suggest that maybe only visual memory skills can be improved.']",What can I do to keep my kids from becoming hyper from sugar?,"To keep kids from becoming hyper from sugar, [92m""Nutritionists say to add more fiber to your child's diet to help keep blood sugar levels even"" [1][0m.

Don\'t be too restrictive. It\'s best to talk with your child\'s doctor before trying any ADHD treatment. She can help you make a healthy eating plan for your child. Or she can refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you with a meal plan and snack ideas. It\'s important to consider what your child will be able to eat when he or she is away from home, like at school, a birthday party, summer camp, or a friend\'s house. This can make a restrictive diet harder to follow. Also, consider whether the whole family, including siblings, will follow the same restrictions. One nutrition move that has shown promise is taking omega-3 supplements. Research has shown that children with ADHD have lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood than the typical child. As a result, some doctors recommend that they take omega-3 supplements. Children who were given omega-3s showed a small improvement in how severe their symptoms were when compared to children who took a placebo. The FDA has approved Vayarin, a ""medical food"" containing omega-3s, for treating ADHD. Research has shown that children as young as preschool-age can benefit from behavior programs. Programs that involve parents have the best success. Some chiropractors believe that chiropractic medicine can treat ADHD. But no research has been done to see if it works. Many ADHD doctors do not support it. One theory is that an imbalance in muscle tone causes an imbalance in brain activity. According to this theory, when chiropractors adjust the ADHD patient\'s spine, balance is restored in the brain. The children are also exposed to different light and sound frequencies. Applied kinesiology, or neural organization technique, is another theory some chiropractors use with people who have ADHD. It\'s based on the thought that the bones of the skull can become misaligned, causing unequal pressure on different parts of the brain. They say this causes the brain to work improperly. To treat it, the chiropractor does adjustments that put the skull bones back to their proper position. But most doctors believe the bones of the skull do not move, so they cannot be misaligned. Neurofeedback teaches a person with ADHD how to change brain waves to focus better. Scientists can study these to look for patterns. There are four waves the brain makes: alpha (medium), beta (fast), theta (slow), and delta (deep sleep). Neurofeedback is based on findings that people with ADHD have more theta waves than other people. They also have fewer beta waves. Supporters believe that training the brain to increase the fast beta waves and decrease the slow theta waves can lower ADHD symptoms. To train them, a medical professional watches the brain waves of the person with ADHD. When their brainwaves reach the right frequency, the health professional lets them know. Through training and practice, they can ultimately learn how to change brain waves on their own. While there has been some promising research in this area, more research is needed to see how well neurofeedback works on ADHD symptoms. A big drawback is the high cost of the treatment. Working Memory Training ( COGMED) Many people with ADHD have trouble with working memory. That\'s remembering information and doing things with it over a short amount of time. Using computer programs to do brain training seems to help people improve their ability to concentrate, control impulsive behaviors, and improve problem-solving skills. Several studies seem to point to some programs making a difference over the short term. But other studies suggest that maybe only visual memory skills can be improved.']",JDbKqDU0kVcpzSa,"[6.3205783367157,4.24208283424377]",2024-09-06 21:05:46.930005+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1}]","[True, True]",3,3

You may be unable to think of little else except finding relief. Some people turn to spinal decompression therapy -- either surgical or nonsurgical. Here's what you need to know to help decide whether it might be right for you. Nonsurgical spinal decompression \x1b[92m[1] is a type of motorized traction that may help relieve back pain\x1b[0m. Spinal decompression works by \x1b[92m[2] gently stretching the spine\x1b[0m. That \x1b[92m[3] changes the force and position of the spine\x1b[0m. This change \x1b[92m[4] takes pressure off the spinal disks\x1b[0m, which are gel-like cushions between the bones in your spine, by creating negative pressure in the disc. As a result, \x1b[92m[5] bulging or herniated disks may retract\x1b[0m, \x1b[92m[6] taking pressure off nerves and other structures in your spine\x1b[0m. This in turn, helps \x1b[92m[7] promote movement of water, oxygen, and nutrient-rich fluids into the disks so they can heal\x1b[0m. Doctors have used nonsurgical spinal decompression in an attempt to treat: Back or neck pain or sciatica, which is pain, weakness, or tingling that extends down the leg Bulging or herniated disks or degenerative disk disease Worn spinal joints (called posterior facet syndrome) Injured or diseased spinal nerve roots \x1b[92m[8] More research is needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of nonsurgical spinal decompression\x1b[0m. To know how effective it really is, researchers need to compare spinal decompression with other alternatives to surgery. These include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Physical therapy Exercise Limited rest Steroid injections Bracing Chiropractic Acupuncture You are fully clothed during spinal decompression therapy. The doctor fits you with a harness around your pelvis and another around your trunk. You either lie face down or face up on a computer-controlled table. A doctor operates the computer, customizing treatment to your specific needs. Treatment may last 30 to 45 minutes and you may require 20 to 28 treatments over five to seven weeks. Before or after therapy, you may have other types of treatment, such as: Electrical stimulation (electric current that causes certain muscles to contract) Ultrasound (the use of sound waves to generate heat and promote healing) Heat or cold therapy Ask your doctor whether or not you are a good candidate for nonsurgical spinal decompression. It is best not to try it if you are pregnant. People with any of these conditions should also not have nonsurgical spinal decompression: Fracture Tumor Abdominal aortic aneurysm Advanced osteoporosis Metal implants in the spine Surgical spinal decompression \x1b[92m[9] is another option for treating certain types of back pain\x1b[0m. But it \x1b[92m[10] is usually used as a last resort\x1b[0m. If other measures don't work, your doctor may suggest surgical spinal decompression \x1b[92m[11] for bulging or ruptured disks, bony growths, or other spinal problems\x1b[0m. Surgery may help \x1b[92m[12] relieve symptoms from pressure on the spinal cord or nerves\x1b[0m, including: Pain Numbness Tingling Weakness Your doctor may suggest one or more types of back surgeries to relieve the pressure in your spine. In addition, you may need spinal fusion to stabilize your spine. The following are the more common types of back surgery: Diskectomy: In this procedure, a portion of the disk is removed to relieve pressure on nerves. Laminotomy or laminectomy: A surgeon removes a small portion of bone -- a section of bony arch or the entire bony arch -- to increase the size of the spinal canal and relieve pressure. Foraminotomy or foraminectomy: A surgeon removes bone and other tissue to expand the openings for nerve roots. Osteophyte removal: During the surgery, bony growths are removed. Corpectomy: This procedure involves removing a vertebral body along with disks between the vertebrae. As with any surgery, \x1b[92m[13] there are risks\x1b[0m. These are some of the more common risks associated with spinal decompression surgery: Infection Bleeding Blood clots Allergic reaction to anesthesia Nerve or tissue damage Another risk of surgery is that \x1b[92m[15] it may not improve back pain much\x1b[0m.

90,212,"['https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-cystic-fibrosis-treatment\nDiagnosing cystic fibrosis in an unborn baby is possible through genetic testing. The National Institutes of Health recommends that genetic testing for cystic fibrosis be offered to all expectant couples or those still planning a pregnancy, especially if they have a family history of the disease. Every state now screens newborns for cystic fibrosis. Blood testing will show whether your baby\'s pancreas is functioning the way it should. A child who shows poor growth and has repeated lung or sinus infections or both should be tested for cystic fibrosis. The standard test for cystic fibrosis is the quantitative sweat chloride test, or ""sweat test,"" which measures the amount of salt in the sweat. Because newborns don\'t sweat, an immunoreactive trypsinogen test ( IRT) may be used instead. This test involves drawing blood and looking for a specific protein called trypsinogen. A positive IRT test may be confirmed at a later date with genetic testing or a sweat test. Other tools that help with diagnosis include chest X-rays and lung function tests, which may show lung problems common in cystic fibrosis. Tests of stool samples may show digestive problems. Treatment for cystic fibrosis focuses on both lung health and digestion. Treating Lung Problems Doctors will focus on preventing lung infections. Daily chest physiotherapy ( CPT), also known as percussion and postural drainage, helps to loosen mucus in the lungs and helps with coughing. During CPT, the person is put into a position that helps drainage, and then all areas of the lungs are ""percussed"" by clapping on the person\'s back with a cupped hand. Family members can perform CPT on small children, while older children and young adults can learn to do it themselves. CPT is usually performed twice a day, though it may be done more frequently when the person has an active lung infection. Treatments using vibrating vests are also being widely used and appear to be better in many children, though expensive. Regular exercise also helps to loosen and move secretions and maintain lung and heart fitness. Antibiotics are crucial to treating cystic fibrosis lung infections. Mucus-thinning drugs help a person cough up mucus in the lungs. Anti-inflammatory drugs help lower inflammation in the lungs. Treating Digestive Problems \x1b[92m[3] People with CF need to eat a well-balanced, high-calorie, high-protein diet\x1b[0m. Their \x1b[92m[1] reduced absorption of nutrients\x1b[0m often means that as children, they \x1b[92m[2] must get up to 150% of the recommended daily allowances to meet their growth needs\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Multivitamins and supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K are also important\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] To help digestion, people with cystic fibrosis need to take pancreatic enzymes before every meal and snack and extra enzymes to help digest high-fat foods\x1b[0m. Those with severe digestive problems may need \x1b[92m[6] supplemental feedings with specialized, high-calorie formulas either with a feeding tube or, in rare cases, through a vein\x1b[0m. Gene Therapy Gene therapy attacks the cause of cystic fibrosis rather than just treating the symptoms. An exciting new advancement, Kalydeco (generic name: ivacaftor), a drug that targets the underlying genetic mutation that causes cystic fibrosis, shows promise. Four percent of those with the disease -- about 1,200 people in the U. S. -- have the specific gene defect that Kalydeco treats. The drug is approved for people over age 6. Transplants Some cystic fibrosis patients have had lung transplants to replace failing lungs. If both parents are carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene, they may wish to consider their chances of having a child with cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing of the unborn baby for cystic fibrosis can be done in the uterus but requires taking fluid or tissue samples from the womb (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling). Once a child is born, there are no treatments available that can prevent cystic fibrosis from developing.']",How can you treat digestive problems from cystic fibrosis?,"Common digestive problems caused by cystic fibrosis include [92m""reduced absorption of nutrients"" [1][0m which often means that children with cystic fibrosis [92m""must get up to 150% of the recommended daily allowances to meet their growth needs"" [2][0m.

Treatments using vibrating vests are also being widely used and appear to be better in many children, though expensive. Regular exercise also helps to loosen and move secretions and maintain lung and heart fitness. Antibiotics are crucial to treating cystic fibrosis lung infections. Mucus-thinning drugs help a person cough up mucus in the lungs. Anti-inflammatory drugs help lower inflammation in the lungs. Treating Digestive Problems People with CF need to eat a well-balanced, high-calorie, high-protein diet. Their reduced absorption of nutrients often means that as children, they must get up to 150% of the recommended daily allowances to meet their growth needs. Multivitamins and supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K are also important. To help digestion, people with cystic fibrosis need to take pancreatic enzymes before every meal and snack and extra enzymes to help digest high-fat foods. Those with severe digestive problems may need supplemental feedings with specialized, high-calorie formulas either with a feeding tube or, in rare cases, through a vein. Gene Therapy Gene therapy attacks the cause of cystic fibrosis rather than just treating the symptoms. An exciting new advancement, Kalydeco (generic name: ivacaftor), a drug that targets the underlying genetic mutation that causes cystic fibrosis, shows promise. Four percent of those with the disease -- about 1,200 people in the U. S. -- have the specific gene defect that Kalydeco treats. The drug is approved for people over age 6. Transplants Some cystic fibrosis patients have had lung transplants to replace failing lungs. If both parents are carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene, they may wish to consider their chances of having a child with cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing of the unborn baby for cystic fibrosis can be done in the uterus but requires taking fluid or tissue samples from the womb (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling). Once a child is born, there are no treatments available that can prevent cystic fibrosis from developing.']",['https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-cystic-fibrosis-treatment'],"['https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-cystic-fibrosis-treatment\nDiagnosing cystic fibrosis in an unborn baby is possible through genetic testing. The National Institutes of Health recommends that genetic testing for cystic fibrosis be offered to all expectant couples or those still planning a pregnancy, especially if they have a family history of the disease. Every state now screens newborns for cystic fibrosis. Blood testing will show whether your baby\'s pancreas is functioning the way it should. A child who shows poor growth and has repeated lung or sinus infections or both should be tested for cystic fibrosis. The standard test for cystic fibrosis is the quantitative sweat chloride test, or ""sweat test,"" which measures the amount of salt in the sweat. Because newborns don\'t sweat, an immunoreactive trypsinogen test ( IRT) may be used instead. This test involves drawing blood and looking for a specific protein called trypsinogen. A positive IRT test may be confirmed at a later date with genetic testing or a sweat test. Other tools that help with diagnosis include chest X-rays and lung function tests, which may show lung problems common in cystic fibrosis. Tests of stool samples may show digestive problems. Treatment for cystic fibrosis focuses on both lung health and digestion. Treating Lung Problems Doctors will focus on preventing lung infections. Daily chest physiotherapy ( CPT), also known as percussion and postural drainage, helps to loosen mucus in the lungs and helps with coughing. During CPT, the person is put into a position that helps drainage, and then all areas of the lungs are ""percussed"" by clapping on the person\'s back with a cupped hand. Family members can perform CPT on small children, while older children and young adults can learn to do it themselves. CPT is usually performed twice a day, though it may be done more frequently when the person has an active lung infection.

91,195,"[""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/bone-tumors\nBone tumors grow when cells in the bone divide without control, forming a mass of tissue. Most bone tumors are benign, which means they are not cancer and do not spread to other areas of the body. But they may still weaken bone and lead to broken bones or cause other problems. Bone cancer destroys normal bone tissue. It may start in the bone or spread from other parts of the body (called metastasis). Benign tumors are more common than tumors caused by cancer. These are a few common types of benign bone tumors: Osteochondroma is the most common benign bone tumor. It is more common in people under age 20. Giant cell tumor is a benign tumor, typically in the leg (malignant types of this tumor are uncommon). Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor, often found in long bones, that happens commonly in the early 20s. Osteoblastoma is a rare, benign tumor that grows in the spine and long bones, mostly in young adults. Enchondroma usually appears in bones of the hands and feet. It often has no symptoms. It is the most common type of hand tumor. Cancer that's in your bones has most often come from cancer elsewhere in your body. For example, if lung cancer has spread to your bones, that's secondary bone cancer. Any cancer that moves from one part of the body to another is called metastatic cancer. Cancers that commonly spread to bone include: Breast cancer Prostate cancer Lung cancer Primary bone cancer, or bone sarcoma, is a cancerous tumor that starts in the bone. The cause is not certain, but heredity may play a role. Radiation therapy or cancer drugs may raise your chances of getting this type of cancer. As with all cancer, if primary bone cancer spreads to other places in your body, it's called metastatic cancer. These are some of the most common types of primary bone cancer: Osteosarcoma is most common around the knee and upper arm. Most of the time, it is found in teens and young adults. There is an adult form of this tumor that is usually seen in people with Paget's disease of bone. Ewing's sarcoma also is seen in younger people between the ages of 5 and 20. The ribs, pelvis, leg, and upper arm are the most common sites. It usually shows up in bone, but it can also start in soft tissue around bones. Chondrosarcoma happens most often in people between 40 and 70. The hip, pelvis, leg, arm, and shoulder are common sites of this cancer, which begins in cartilage cells. Although almost always found in bone, multiple myelomais not a primary bone cancer. It is a bone marrow cancer. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones. You may have no symptoms of a bone tumor, whether it's cancer or not. This is common. Your doctor may find a tumor when looking at an X-ray of another problem, such as a sprain. But symptoms may include pain that: Is in the area of the tumor Is dull or achy May get worse with activity Wakes you at night Trauma does not cause a bone tumor, but a bone that is weakened by a tumor may break more easily.

Cancer cells confined to the bone tumor and surrounding area are at a localized stage. Bone cancers that spread to or from other areas of the body are more serious and a cure is more difficult. \x1b[92m[9] Cancers of the bone are most often removed with surgery\x1b[0m. These are the common types of treatment for bone cancer: Limb salvage surgery removes the part of the bone with cancer. Nearby muscles, tendons, and other tissues are not removed.

92,72,"['https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/continuous-panic-attacks\nIf you get a panic attack, it \x1b[92m[1] usually lasts 20 to 30 minutes, hitting its peak at about 10 minutes in\x1b[0m. So what\'s going on if it seems to you like your panic attack just won\'t end? To figure out the possible reasons it feels this way, it helps to understand what\'s happening during a panic attack. When you have one, it triggers your ""\x1b[92m[2] fight or flight\x1b[0m"" response, which is how your body reacts when your physical safety is threatened. You get \x1b[92m[3] a rush of adrenaline\x1b[0m that amps you up so you can make a split-second decision to run or fight. This response isn\'t meant to last very long and soon burns itself out. That\'s why panic attacks that last as long as an hour aren\'t very common. What\'s the story with a panic attack that seems to go and on? If that\'s happening to you, it\'s likely one of three things: Waves of panic attacks Aftereffects of a single panic attack Another health condition If you have panic attack symptoms for an hour or more, you may really be having a wave of panic attacks, one after another. There\'s actually a period of recovery between them, though you may not notice it. The overall effect feels like you\'re being hit with one never-ending attack. It\'s rare that this happens, though. The \x1b[92m[2] fight or flight\x1b[0m response is so draining, it\'s hard to set it off that often. A more likely possibility is that you had a single panic attack that leaves you feeling generally anxious, tired, and frayed. While panic attacks can be scary, they\'re not dangerous. But the fear they may cause you can be more unsettling than the attack itself. That\'s especially true if you\'ve never had one before. When it\'s your first episode, you may think you\'re having a stroke or a heart attack. How do you tell if it\'s a panic attack or high anxiety? It\'s tricky. It helps to talk to your doctor, but a closer look at your symptoms often can give you some clues. A true panic attack tends to have \x1b[92m[4] clear, intense, physical symptoms -- a pounding heart, shortness of breath, and so on\x1b[0m. Anxiety can give you some of these, but they tend to be milder. Instead, you\'ll have \x1b[92m[5] more mental symptoms like a racing mind, lots of worries you can\'t stop, and a hard time focusing\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] You might also feel restless and have a hard time sleeping\x1b[0m. The condition that most closely mirrors a longer panic attack is generalized anxiety disorder. This is where you have a hard time controlling your worry, and you struggle to keep your anxiety in check. But one of the challenges with panic attacks, long or short, is that the same symptoms happen with a wide range of other health conditions, including allergic reactions and heart and lung diseases. And if you have a tendency to panic, some health problems -- like low blood sugar, asthma, or an overactive thyroid -- can trigger a full-blown panic attack. Keep in mind that typically, people mistake a panic attack for another health condition, not the other way around. Just because you\'re having a long panic attack, it doesn\'t mean you have something else going on. But it\'s worth checking it out with your doctor.']",How can you tell a panic attack from high anxiety?,"A panic attack [92m""usually lasts 20 to 30 minutes, hitting its peak at about 10 minutes in"" [1][0m and triggers the [92m""fight or flight"" [2][0m response, leading to [92m""a rush of adrenaline"" [3][0m.

So what\'s going on if it seems to you like your panic attack just won\'t end? To figure out the possible reasons it feels this way, it helps to understand what\'s happening during a panic attack. When you have one, it triggers your ""fight or flight"" response, which is how your body reacts when your physical safety is threatened. You get a rush of adrenaline that amps you up so you can make a split-second decision to run or fight. This response isn\'t meant to last very long and soon burns itself out. That\'s why panic attacks that last as long as an hour aren\'t very common. What\'s the story with a panic attack that seems to go and on? If that\'s happening to you, it\'s likely one of three things: Waves of panic attacks Aftereffects of a single panic attack Another health condition If you have panic attack symptoms for an hour or more, you may really be having a wave of panic attacks, one after another. There\'s actually a period of recovery between them, though you may not notice it. The overall effect feels like you\'re being hit with one never-ending attack. It\'s rare that this happens, though. The fight or flight response is so draining, it\'s hard to set it off that often. A more likely possibility is that you had a single panic attack that leaves you feeling generally anxious, tired, and frayed. While panic attacks can be scary, they\'re not dangerous. But the fear they may cause you can be more unsettling than the attack itself. That\'s especially true if you\'ve never had one before. When it\'s your first episode, you may think you\'re having a stroke or a heart attack. How do you tell if it\'s a panic attack or high anxiety? It\'s tricky. It helps to talk to your doctor, but a closer look at your symptoms often can give you some clues. A true panic attack tends to have clear, intense, physical symptoms -- a pounding heart, shortness of breath, and so on. Anxiety can give you some of these, but they tend to be milder. Instead, you\'ll have more mental symptoms like a racing mind, lots of worries you can\'t stop, and a hard time focusing. You might also feel restless and have a hard time sleeping. The condition that most closely mirrors a longer panic attack is generalized anxiety disorder. This is where you have a hard time controlling your worry, and you struggle to keep your anxiety in check. But one of the challenges with panic attacks, long or short, is that the same symptoms happen with a wide range of other health conditions, including allergic reactions and heart and lung diseases. And if you have a tendency to panic, some health problems -- like low blood sugar, asthma, or an overactive thyroid -- can trigger a full-blown panic attack. Keep in mind that typically, people mistake a panic attack for another health condition, not the other way around.

Stay moisturized. Your skin needs moisture to heal and protect itself. Most lotions can't create a strong barrier for your skin because they contain water. Choose a thick cream or ointment instead. Petroleum jelly and mineral oil work well. Put it on your skin at least twice a day to keep your eczema at bay. Avoid drastic temperature changes. Going from a hot room into a chilly one may cause a flare-up. Try to keep your home at a comfortable, consistent temperature. Low humidity can dry your skin. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air. Skip long, hot showers. Very hot water will dry your skin and make your symptoms worse. Take lukewarm showers or baths instead. Use mild, perfume-free soap or non-soap cleanser, and avoid bubble baths. When you're done, gently towel off your skin -- don't rub -- until it's partly dry. Then, within 3 minutes, put on a moisturizer. If your doctor has prescribed an eczema cream, apply that to your skin first. Keep your house clean. Allergens like dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and mold put your immune system on alert, which can wake up your eczema. Skip scented laundry products. The perfume in many cleansers and fabric softeners can irritate your skin. You're better off using gentle, scent-free products. And always wash new clothes before wearing them.

94,64,"['https://www.webmd.com/children/treating-coughs\nWhen your child coughs, her body is doing its job. A cough is a reflex that clears fluid from the throat and chest. It happens when nerve endings in those airways get irritated. It\'s one of the most common symptoms of colds and other viruses, including the flu. But if it\'s caused by a virus, antibiotics won\'t make it stop. Viral infections have to run their course. Ask yourself some questions: Does your child have other symptoms? A cough that comes with a runny nose and sneezing may point to a cold. Those symptoms, body aches, and a fever often come with the flu. When did the cough start? Allergies are more likely in the spring and fall. What does it sound like? Allergies, viral infections, and the croup can bring on a barking cough. Whooping cough (pertussis) brings on a noise that sounds like ""hoop!"" Call your doctor if you hear that sound. A wheezing sound could mean something is blocking your child\'s airway. It could be brought on by pneumonia or asthma. Call the doctor. What if the cough won\'t go away? Visit the doctor. Most last no more than a few weeks, but some people have ones that stick around long after other symptoms are gone. In a child, a cough is considered chronic if it lasts more than 4 weeks. For adults, it\'s 8 weeks or more. Ask your doctor before giving your child any cough medicine. Don\'t give over-the-counter cough medicine to children younger than 4. They aren\'t meant for young kids. Even medicine labeled for children can have serious side effects, such as high blood pressure and seizures. No drugs can cure a cough caused by a virus, but treatments may soothe symptoms. Here are a few home remedies to try: Steam: You can create your own steam room. Close the door to your bathroom and run hot water in the shower for several minutes until the mirrors fog. The steam helps unclog your child\'s nose. Humidity: A cool-mist humidifier in your child\'s room adds moisture to the air to break up congestion and help your little one breathe easier. Fluids: Give her plenty of drinks like water or juice to thin the mucus in her throat, making it easier for her to cough up phlegm. Cough drops: For kids over age 5, lozenges and hard candy can bring some relief to a sore throat caused by coughing. Cool air: If your child has croup, take her outside for a while. The cool air sometimes can relieve a croupy cough. ( Just make sure you dress her properly for the weather.) If this doesn\'t help or you think your child is sick, get medical help.

Doctors use it to treat the following conditions: Cancers of the colon and rectum Some types of noncancerous growths in the colon and rectum Complicated diverticulitis The term ""laparoscopic"" refers to a type of surgery called laparoscopy, in which the surgeon works through very small (5-millimeter to 10-millimeter) ""keyhole"" cuts in the abdomen. A laparoscope is a small telescope-like instrument. Your surgeon will use it in order to see inside you during the operation. There are five main steps to this surgery. First, you\'ll get general anesthesia so that you\'re √¢\x80\x9casleep.√¢\x80\x9d Then your surgeon will make a small cut (about half an inch) near your bellybutton and place the laparoscope through it so he can see images from inside you. Once the laparoscope is in place, the surgeon will make five or six more small (5-10 millimeter) cuts to make room for the surgical tools. Your surgeon will need to cut away the diseased section of your sigmoid colon and rectum. But first, he must free this section from what supports it. The bowel is attached to the abdominal wall by a layer of tissue called the mesentery, which also contains the main blood vessels (arteries) that take blood to the left side of the colon and rectum. Your surgeon will cut and close them. Then he\'ll free the sigmoid colon and part of the rectum from the mesentery, and cut away the diseased tissue. Later, he\'ll remove this part of the mesentery with the diseased bowel. The surgeon must rejoin the remaining end of the descending colon with the remaining end of the rectum. First, he will detach a part of the healthy descending colon from the mesentery so that he can stretch it toward the rectum. He\'ll also free the rectum from its mesentery so it can meet the end of the colon. To reduce the risk of cancer cells spreading, the surgeon will wash the rectum with a special solution. The cuts used in laparoscopy are very small, so the surgeon must remove the diseased section of bowel in a special way. He will enlarge one of the cuts and place a bag into your abdominal cavity, put the diseased bowel into the bag, and then pull the bag out of the enlarged cut. To do this, your surgeon will use a special stapling device he places into the rectum. Doctors call this rejoining of the colon and rectum an anastomosis. The stapling device ""fires"" a ring of staples to connect the two ends. The surgeon will check the anastomosis for leaks and rinse out your pelvis. Your surgeon may place a drain into your abdomen for a few days to help you recover after surgery. And he will stitch or tape close all the surgical cuts. \x1b[92m[1] You should avoid heavy lifting and abdominal exercises such as sit-ups for 6 weeks after the surgery\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Apart from that, you should steadily build up your activity level when you get home\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Walking is a great exercise choice\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] It will help your recovery by making you stronger, keeping your blood circulating to prevent blood clots, and helping your lungs remain clear\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Did you work out before the surgery?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] You can get back to exercising when you feel comfortable and your doctor says it\'s OK\x1b[0m.

96,130,"[""https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-osteoporosis\nWhen you have rheumatoid arthritis ( RA), you expect painful or stiff joints. But did you know RA also can make your bones weaker and more likely to break? That's because RA raises your risk of getting osteoporosis, a condition that makes your bones porous or not as dense and strong as they should be to hold up your weight. When this happens, even a minor slip or tumble can cause a painful crack or fracture. The bones most likely to break are in your hips, spine, and wrists. Osteoporosis is very common, especially as you age. People at higher risk include women, particularly after menopause; people with thin frames; smokers; and people who don't get enough calcium or aren't active. There are reasons RA makes you more likely to get osteoporosis: Inflammation : When you have RA, you have inflammation all over your body, especially in your joints. They can swell and break down. That can weaken your bones around the joints affected by RA, like the joints in your hands. Our bodies are always making new bone to replace bone that breaks down. But RA inflammation breaks this cycle. It speeds up your bone loss and slows the making of new bone to replace it. Your bones get weaker, and that leads to osteoporosis. \x1b[92m[4] Inflammation also may make it harder for your body to absorb nutrients it needs to keep your bones strong, like calcium or vitamin D\x1b[0m. Pain makes you inactive: RA can make you feel stiff, achy, or so tired that you don't feel like getting off the couch. Physical activity, like walking, helps keep your bones strong. If you don't exercise, your bones can get weaker over time. If RA keeps you from being active, you're at higher risk for osteoporosis. Steroid drugs: Corticosteroid drugs like prednisone ( Deltasone) can weaken your bones if you take them for a long time. Some people with RA need to take these medications to help with bad flares of inflammation. The drugs can quickly ease pain and swelling so you can get moving again. But they can make it harder for your body to absorb calcium and vitamin D in your diet. These nutrients help you build strong bones. Your osteoporosis risk is even higher if you're a woman past menopause and have taken steroids for 6 months or more. If you have RA, you can do things to help protect your bones: Get inflammation under control. RA drugs like methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) inhibitors, such as adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab ( Remicade), or infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade, can stop inflammation and reduce your risk of a fracture. TNF inhibitors may even protect you from this damage. Eat and drink for stronger bones. \x1b[92m[1] Get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet to keep bones healthy\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Enjoy low-fat dairy products or dark, leafy green veggies to get calcium from natural sources\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Get vitamin D in egg yolks, ocean fish, and liver\x1b[0m. You may need calcium or vitamin D supplements. Stay active. \x1b[92m[5] Exercise helps you develop flexible joints, stronger muscles, and better balance with RA\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] It also can help you protect your bones from osteoporosis because it builds bone mass\x1b[0m. The best activities for this are walking, dancing, climbing, or strength training. Even light exercise, like a short walk, can make your joints feel looser and keep your bones strong. Don't smoke or drink too much. Smoking raises your risk of osteoporosis. It also can cause women to go through menopause and start losing bone mass earlier in life. So if you smoke, quit now. Drinking too much also can make you more likely to lose bone or even to slip and fall. Get bone tests. See your doctor regularly to test for signs of osteoporosis. Some people don't know they have it until they have a painful fracture. A bone-density test can tell you if your bones are starting to weaken (osteopenia). This test uses X-rays to see how much calcium and other bone minerals are in your bones. Your spine, hips, and forearms are the most common areas tested. If you take certain drugs for RA, like steroids, this test can show bone problems early so you can make changes to keep it from getting worse. Ask your doctor about bone-preserving drugs. Medications called bisphosphonates can help stop your bones from breaking down. These include zoledronate ( Reclast) and denosumab ( Prolia, Xgeva). You'll need to take these for a long time, so talk to your doctor to see if they're right for you. Avoid accidents. If you have RA and are at risk for osteoporosis, take extra care not to slip or fall. Physical and occupational therapists can show you safer ways to do daily tasks and how to safely exercise. Yoga, tai chi, or low-impact aerobics may help you stay fit and improve your balance.""]",How can I eat and drink properly for stronger bones?,"To eat and drink properly for stronger bones, [92m""Get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet to keep bones healthy"" [1][0m.

Stay active. \x1b[92m[5] Exercise helps you develop flexible joints, stronger muscles, and better balance with RA\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] It also can help you protect your bones from osteoporosis because it builds bone mass\x1b[0m. The best activities for this are walking, dancing, climbing, or strength training. Even light exercise, like a short walk, can make your joints feel looser and keep your bones strong. Don't smoke or drink too much. Smoking raises your risk of osteoporosis. It also can cause women to go through menopause and start losing bone mass earlier in life. So if you smoke, quit now. Drinking too much also can make you more likely to lose bone or even to slip and fall. Get bone tests. See your doctor regularly to test for signs of osteoporosis. Some people don't know they have it until they have a painful fracture. A bone-density test can tell you if your bones are starting to weaken (osteopenia). This test uses X-rays to see how much calcium and other bone minerals are in your bones. Your spine, hips, and forearms are the most common areas tested. If you take certain drugs for RA, like steroids, this test can show bone problems early so you can make changes to keep it from getting worse. Ask your doctor about bone-preserving drugs. Medications called bisphosphonates can help stop your bones from breaking down. These include zoledronate ( Reclast) and denosumab ( Prolia, Xgeva). You'll need to take these for a long time, so talk to your doctor to see if they're right for you. Avoid accidents. If you have RA and are at risk for osteoporosis, take extra care not to slip or fall. Physical and occupational therapists can show you safer ways to do daily tasks and how to safely exercise. Yoga, tai chi, or low-impact aerobics may help you stay fit and improve your balance.""]",eQBKoJjNAPP7V6Z,"[31.1663575172424,8.32726168632507,8.29165124893188,7.17810463905334,11.0443475246429,6.54399275779724]",2024-09-06 21:16:59.286036+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[0],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":3},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":4},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":5}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":3},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":4},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":5}]","[True, True, True, True, True]",3,3

Sometimes cells will divide for no reason and without order, creating a mass of tissue called a tumor. Tumors can be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Testicular cancer is a malignant tumor in a testicle. The testicles are oval-shaped sex glands in a sac of skin called the scrotum. The scrotum is located behind the penis. This type of cancer, although relatively rare, mostly affects men between ages 15 and 35 (although it can affect males at any age), and in a man's 60s. You can detect testicular cancer by doing a monthly testicular self-exam. Such an exam is a way that men can look for signs of cancer of the testicles. To do a self-exam, follow these steps. Do the exam after a warm shower or bath. The warmth relaxes the skin of the scrotum, making it easier to feel for anything unusual. Use both hands to examine each testicle. Place your index and middle fingers underneath the testicle and your thumbs on top. Roll the testicle between your thumbs and fingers. ( It's normal for testicles to be different sizes.) As you feel the testicle, you may notice a cord-like structure on top and in back of the testicle. This structure is called the epididymis. It stores and transports sperm. Do not confuse it with a lump. Feel for any lumps. Lumps can be pea-size or larger and are often painless. If you notice a lump, contact your doctor. Also check for any change in size, shape, or consistency of the testes. You should also get a physical exam once a year. After a while, you will know how your testicles feel and will be more alert to any changes. Symptoms of testicular cancer include: A lump in either testicle. An enlarged (swollen) testicle. A dull ache in the lower abdomen or groin. A sudden gathering of fluid in the scrotum. Feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. Low back pain Swollen breasts If you have symptoms of testicular cancer, don't panic. Many times, changes in the testicles are not cancer.

98,154,"[""https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/hpv-vaccine\nWhen the FDA approved the first human papillomavirus ( HPV) vaccine in 2006, it was big news. The new HPV vaccination made headlines at the time, which wasn't surprising, given that it was the very first vaccine approved to prevent cervical cancer. Yet, even though the HPV vaccine has been around for years, not everyone knows exactly what it is or what it does. You might be wondering: How does it work? Is it safe? Should you or your child get it? So you can be more confident when you talk to your doctor about the HPV vaccine, here are answers to these and other common questions about the vaccine. HPV stands for human papillomavirus. It's a virus that can be transmitted through sexual contact. During intercourse or oral sex, HPV can make its way into the genitals, mouth, or throat and cause infection. Sexually transmitted HPV comes in more than 40 different varieties. The type of the virus you get determines what effects it has on your body. Certain types of HPV cause genital warts. Other HPV types can make cells turn cancerous. You've probably heard that HPV causes cervical cancer, but it also causes less common cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, head, and neck. What's tricky about HPV is that it doesn't have symptoms. There's no sore throat or fever to let you know you've been infected. Most people clear the infection on their own. In fact, you might have absolutely no idea you've been infected until you develop genital warts or have an abnormal Pap test. Though HPV might not be as well known among sexually transmitted infections ( STIs) as herpes or syphilis, it is actually the most common STI. If you're sexually active, there's a very good chance of being infected with HPV at some point in your life. That's why immunization is so important. Three vaccines are available to protect against the types of HPV that cause most cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile and anal cancers. They are Gardasil, and Gardasil 9. They also protect against most genital warts. Whichever of these vaccines you and your doctor choose, you should stick with the same vaccine for all three shots. Whether you have to get vaccinated depends on your age and where you live. In certain states, girls and boys within the recommended ages may need to get the HPV vaccine in order to go to school. Getting vaccinated could help lead to the reduction of the prevalence of HPV infection. HPV is known to cause cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal cancer, as well as cancer of the back of the throat. Cervical cancer alone kills about 4,000 women each year in the U. S. One in four persons in the United States is infected with HPV and most of them are unaware. It spreads easily among infected partners. Gardasil prevents HPV-16 and HPV-18, which is responsible for 70% of all cervical cancers, as well as HPV- 6 and HPV-11, which are known to cause 90% of all genital warts. Gardasil 9 also protects against these four HPV strains, as well as five others. The best time to get the HPV vaccine is before you've started having sexual activity. That's why the CDC recommends that both boys and girls get their vaccination at age 11 or 12, although they can get the vaccine as early as age 9. If you're 13 or older and you haven't already been vaccinated, you can still get the vaccine through age 26. Gardasil 9 can be given to both males and females until age 45. The Gardasil vaccine isn't recommended for people over age 26, because it hasn't been studied well enough in this age group. If enough future studies show that it is safe and effective for people over 26, the FDA may eventually start recommending it for this age group. The FDA has approved the use of Gardasil 9 for males and females up to age 45. You'll get three shots of the HPV vaccine over a 6-month period. You need to take all three doses to be completely protected. You'll get the second shot about 1 to 2 months after the first, and the third shot 6 months after the first. Once you've started with a vaccine brand ( Gardasil or Gardasil 9), stick with it for all three shots. \x1b[92m[1] No. If you have a current HPV, the vaccine won't get rid of the infection\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] However, if you have one type of HPV, the vaccine may prevent you from getting another type of the virus\x1b[0m. There's really no way to treat the virus once you have it, although there are treatments for diseases caused by HPV such as genital warts and genital cancers. This is why you should have regular pelvic exams and Pap tests (if you're female) to screen for cervical cancer. The vaccine appears to offer long-term protection from HPV. However, even women who have received the vaccine should see their gynecologist regularly for a Pap test to check for cervical cancer, because the vaccine doesn't protect against all HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. Most insurance plans cover routine vaccines, which means that if you're in the recommended age group, your insurance should pay for the vaccine. Check with your insurance company just to be sure. If your family doesn't have health insurance or you're on Medicaid, you should be able to get the HPV vaccine for free through the Vaccines for Children ( VFC) program. Vaccines have to be rigorously tested before they can be widely distributed. The HPV vaccines were tested on thousands of people and shown to be safe before they were released to the public. These vaccines have been used for years now, and experts say the chance of them causing a serious reaction is very slim. The HPV vaccine does not contain mercury or the preservative thimerosal. Some people shouldn't get the vaccine. You definitely don't want to get the HPV vaccine if you've had a serious allergic reaction to it or to any of its components. Let your doctor know if you have any severe allergies to anything, including baker's yeast or latex. Also, talk to your doctor if you have an immune system problem or blood disorder. If you're pregnant, you'll want to wait to get the HPV vaccine until after your baby is born. In studies, HPV vaccines have not been found to cause any problems in babies whose mothers got the vaccine while pregnant, but pregnant women should not get HPV vaccine, as safety studies are still ongoing. You could have side effects, but they should be mild. Most people who complain of symptoms after getting the HPV shot have minor issues like pain or swelling at the site of the shot, fever, headache, and nausea. Sometimes people faint after getting the HPV vaccine or any other vaccination. Sitting down after getting the shot can help prevent you from passing out.

You've probably heard that HPV causes cervical cancer, but it also causes less common cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, head, and neck. What's tricky about HPV is that it doesn't have symptoms. There's no sore throat or fever to let you know you've been infected. Most people clear the infection on their own. In fact, you might have absolutely no idea you've been infected until you develop genital warts or have an abnormal Pap test. Though HPV might not be as well known among sexually transmitted infections ( STIs) as herpes or syphilis, it is actually the most common STI. If you're sexually active, there's a very good chance of being infected with HPV at some point in your life. That's why immunization is so important. Three vaccines are available to protect against the types of HPV that cause most cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile and anal cancers. They are Gardasil, and Gardasil 9. They also protect against most genital warts. Whichever of these vaccines you and your doctor choose, you should stick with the same vaccine for all three shots. Whether you have to get vaccinated depends on your age and where you live. In certain states, girls and boys within the recommended ages may need to get the HPV vaccine in order to go to school. Getting vaccinated could help lead to the reduction of the prevalence of HPV infection. HPV is known to cause cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal cancer, as well as cancer of the back of the throat. Cervical cancer alone kills about 4,000 women each year in the U. S. One in four persons in the United States is infected with HPV and most of them are unaware. It spreads easily among infected partners. Gardasil prevents HPV-16 and HPV-18, which is responsible for 70% of all cervical cancers, as well as HPV- 6 and HPV-11, which are known to cause 90% of all genital warts. Gardasil 9 also protects against these four HPV strains, as well as five others. The best time to get the HPV vaccine is before you've started having sexual activity. That's why the CDC recommends that both boys and girls get their vaccination at age 11 or 12, although they can get the vaccine as early as age 9. If you're 13 or older and you haven't already been vaccinated, you can still get the vaccine through age 26. Gardasil 9 can be given to both males and females until age 45. The Gardasil vaccine isn't recommended for people over age 26, because it hasn't been studied well enough in this age group. If enough future studies show that it is safe and effective for people over 26, the FDA may eventually start recommending it for this age group. The FDA has approved the use of Gardasil 9 for males and females up to age 45. You'll get three shots of the HPV vaccine over a 6-month period. You need to take all three doses to be completely protected. You'll get the second shot about 1 to 2 months after the first, and the third shot 6 months after the first. Once you've started with a vaccine brand ( Gardasil or Gardasil 9), stick with it for all three shots. \x1b[92m[1] No. If you have a current HPV, the vaccine won't get rid of the infection\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] However, if you have one type of HPV, the vaccine may prevent you from getting another type of the virus\x1b[0m. There's really no way to treat the virus once you have it, although there are treatments for diseases caused by HPV such as genital warts and genital cancers. This is why you should have regular pelvic exams and Pap tests (if you're female) to screen for cervical cancer. The vaccine appears to offer long-term protection from HPV. However, even women who have received the vaccine should see their gynecologist regularly for a Pap test to check for cervical cancer, because the vaccine doesn't protect against all HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. Most insurance plans cover routine vaccines, which means that if you're in the recommended age group, your insurance should pay for the vaccine. Check with your insurance company just to be sure. If your family doesn't have health insurance or you're on Medicaid, you should be able to get the HPV vaccine for free through the Vaccines for Children ( VFC) program. Vaccines have to be rigorously tested before they can be widely distributed. The HPV vaccines were tested on thousands of people and shown to be safe before they were released to the public. These vaccines have been used for years now, and experts say the chance of them causing a serious reaction is very slim. The HPV vaccine does not contain mercury or the preservative thimerosal. Some people shouldn't get the vaccine. You definitely don't want to get the HPV vaccine if you've had a serious allergic reaction to it or to any of its components. Let your doctor know if you have any severe allergies to anything, including baker's yeast or latex. Also, talk to your doctor if you have an immune system problem or blood disorder. If you're pregnant, you'll want to wait to get the HPV vaccine until after your baby is born. In studies, HPV vaccines have not been found to cause any problems in babies whose mothers got the vaccine while pregnant, but pregnant women should not get HPV vaccine, as safety studies are still ongoing. You could have side effects, but they should be mild. Most people who complain of symptoms after getting the HPV shot have minor issues like pain or swelling at the site of the shot, fever, headache, and nausea. Sometimes people faint after getting the HPV vaccine or any other vaccination. Sitting down after getting the shot can help prevent you from passing out. No. The part of the HPV virus used in both vaccines is inactivated (not live), so it can't cause actual HPV infection.""]",4mI9lIjKHyuqizb,[7.21789407730103],2024-09-06 21:12:16.911987+00,"[{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2}]","[{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2}]","[False, True, True]",3,3

Most cases of Cushing\'s syndrome can be cured, though it may take some time for your symptoms to ease up. The condition, also known as hypercortisolism, is more common in women than men. It\'s most often seen in people ages 25 to 40. You can get Cushing\'s syndrome when there\'s too much cortisol in your body for too long. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys. The most common cause is related to medications called glucocorticoids, also commonly known as steroids or prednisone. These prescription steroids are used for conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or after an organ transplant. They are powerful anti-inflammatory medications. Taking too much, for too long, can lead to Cushing\'s syndrome. A tumor in your pituitary gland, found at the base of the brain, or a tumor in the adrenal glands, can also prompt your body to make too much cortisol, which can lead to Cushing\'s. It\'s not usually a condition that\'s passed in families. In some rare cases, though, people develop it because a problem in their genes makes them more likely to get tumors on their glands. Your case might be different than someone else\'s, but when the disease is full-blown, common symptoms are: Rounded, rosy face Weight gain, especially upper body A fat pad in the upper back or base of the neck (you may hear this called a ""buffalo hump"") Thinning skin that is easy to bruise Acne Being very tired Weak muscles, especially when using your shoulders and hip muscles High blood pressure High blood sugar levels Depression and anxiety Osteoporosis Kidney stones Sleep problems Extra hair growth on your body and face Irregular periods Low sex drive and problems having an erection Your skin could become thin, heal slowly, and bruise easily. You might get purple or pink stretch marks all over your body, especially your belly, thighs, arms, and chest. Your bones may get weak. Everyday movements like bending, lifting, or even getting out of a chair can cause backaches or breaks in your ribs or spine. Children with Cushing\'s syndrome are usually very heavy, what doctors call obese, and tend to grow slowly. It might take several appointments to settle on your diagnosis. When you go to your doctor, she\'ll do a physical exam and ask you questions. What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Are you feeling more emotional? What medications are you taking? Your doctor will probably also recommend some of these tests to help screen for Cushing\'s syndrome if she suspects you have it: 24-hour urinary free cortisol test. This common test collects your urine for 24 hours to measure how much cortisol is in it. Dexamethasone suppression test . You\'ll take a low-dose steroid pill at 11:00 p.m. and then take a blood test in the morning to see how much cortisol your body still makes. Late-night salivary cortisol level. This test measures cortisol in your saliva. As the name suggests, these tests happen at night. If you have Cushing\'s syndrome, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who will do other blood tests or imaging scans to find out what\'s causing it. Will my symptoms change? If so, how? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? How will we know if they\'re working? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? When will I start to feel better? Does this condition put me at risk for any others? The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. That will lead to how to treat your condition. For instance, \x1b[92m[3] if you have too much cortisol because you\'re taking steroid medicines, your doctor will check to see if you can stop taking the drugs, or take a lower dose\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] If a tumor is causing your Cushing\'s syndrome, you\'ll likely have other tests to determine the location of the tumor first before deciding on your treatment\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Surgery to remove the tumor may be best\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] If not, your doctor may be able to shrink the tumor with radiation or medicine\x1b[0m. Eating well is an important part of living with Cushing\'s. A healthy diet can ease some symptoms and prevent others. \x1b[92m[7] Protect your bones by eating foods with calcium and vitamin D. Limit how much sodium and fatty foods you eat\x1b[0m. A nutritionist can help you make sure you\'re getting enough of the right nutrients. \x1b[92m[8] Let your family and friends know what you\'re going through\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] Ask for their support, and let them know how they can help\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] Take time for the people and activities you enjoy\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] It\'s OK to say no and set limits, so you keep your energy up\x1b[0m. If you\'re feeling overwhelmed, talk to a counselor or therapist. Your doctor may be able to give you a referral. Your symptoms and how long they\'ll last depend on: The amount of extra cortisol you have The cause of your high cortisol How long you\'ve had the condition Your overall health Most of the time Cushing\'s syndrome can be treated and cured. If your Cushing\'s syndrome isn\'t curable, you\'ll want to look for ways to manage your weight gain, muscle weakness, and tiredness. Partner with your doctor on that, and tell your doctor how you\'re feeling. If you get depressed, it\'s important to get treated for that. Look for ways to connect online and in person with people who have experience with Cushing\'s syndrome. You can learn more about living with the condition, and meet other people who have it, in forums on the Cushing\'s Support & Research Foundation web site.']",How should I take care of myself if I have Cushing's syndrome?,"Cushing's syndrome is [92m""all about the stress hormone cortisol"" [1][0m. [92m""When your body has too much of it, the excess hormone can throw off your body's other systems"" [2][0m.

Does this condition put me at risk for any others? The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. That will lead to how to treat your condition. For instance, if you have too much cortisol because you\'re taking steroid medicines, your doctor will check to see if you can stop taking the drugs, or take a lower dose. If a tumor is causing your Cushing\'s syndrome, you\'ll likely have other tests to determine the location of the tumor first before deciding on your treatment. Surgery to remove the tumor may be best. If not, your doctor may be able to shrink the tumor with radiation or medicine. Eating well is an important part of living with Cushing\'s. A healthy diet can ease some symptoms and prevent others. Protect your bones by eating foods with calcium and vitamin D. Limit how much sodium and fatty foods you eat. A nutritionist can help you make sure you\'re getting enough of the right nutrients. Let your family and friends know what you\'re going through. Ask for their support, and let them know how they can help. Take time for the people and activities you enjoy. It\'s OK to say no and set limits, so you keep your energy up. If you\'re feeling overwhelmed, talk to a counselor or therapist. Your doctor may be able to give you a referral. Your symptoms and how long they\'ll last depend on: The amount of extra cortisol you have The cause of your high cortisol How long you\'ve had the condition Your overall health Most of the time Cushing\'s syndrome can be treated and cured. If your Cushing\'s syndrome isn\'t curable, you\'ll want to look for ways to manage your weight gain, muscle weakness, and tiredness. Partner with your doctor on that, and tell your doctor how you\'re feeling. If you get depressed, it\'s important to get treated for that. Look for ways to connect online and in person with people who have experience with Cushing\'s syndrome. You can learn more about living with the condition, and meet other people who have it, in forums on the Cushing\'s Support & Research Foundation web site.']",['https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cushing-syndrome'],"['https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cushing-syndrome\nvar s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context[\'wb.modimp\'] = \'vidfloat\'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $(\'.responsive-video-container\').insert After(\'.module-social-share-container\'); require([\'video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader\'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $(\'article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)\').attr(\'chronic_id\'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: \'in-article\', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $(\'.responsive-video-container\').remove(); }); } Cushing\'s syndrome is \x1b[92m[1] all about the stress hormone cortisol\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] When your body has too much of it, the excess hormone can throw off your body\'s other systems\x1b[0m. Most cases of Cushing\'s syndrome can be cured, though it may take some time for your symptoms to ease up. The condition, also known as hypercortisolism, is more common in women than men. It\'s most often seen in people ages 25 to 40. You can get Cushing\'s syndrome when there\'s too much cortisol in your body for too long. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys. The most common cause is related to medications called glucocorticoids, also commonly known as steroids or prednisone. These prescription steroids are used for conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or after an organ transplant. They are powerful anti-inflammatory medications. Taking too much, for too long, can lead to Cushing\'s syndrome. A tumor in your pituitary gland, found at the base of the brain, or a tumor in the adrenal glands, can also prompt your body to make too much cortisol, which can lead to Cushing\'s. It\'s not usually a condition that\'s passed in families. In some rare cases, though, people develop it because a problem in their genes makes them more likely to get tumors on their glands. Your case might be different than someone else\'s, but when the disease is full-blown, common symptoms are: Rounded, rosy face Weight gain, especially upper body A fat pad in the upper back or base of the neck (you may hear this called a ""buffalo hump"") Thinning skin that is easy to bruise Acne Being very tired Weak muscles, especially when using your shoulders and hip muscles High blood pressure High blood sugar levels Depression and anxiety Osteoporosis Kidney stones Sleep problems Extra hair growth on your body and face Irregular periods Low sex drive and problems having an erection Your skin could become thin, heal slowly, and bruise easily. You might get purple or pink stretch marks all over your body, especially your belly, thighs, arms, and chest. Your bones may get weak. Everyday movements like bending, lifting, or even getting out of a chair can cause backaches or breaks in your ribs or spine. Children with Cushing\'s syndrome are usually very heavy, what doctors call obese, and tend to grow slowly. It might take several appointments to settle on your diagnosis. When you go to your doctor, she\'ll do a physical exam and ask you questions. What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Are you feeling more emotional? What medications are you taking? Your doctor will probably also recommend some of these tests to help screen for Cushing\'s syndrome if she suspects you have it: 24-hour urinary free cortisol test. This common test collects your urine for 24 hours to measure how much cortisol is in it. Dexamethasone suppression test . You\'ll take a low-dose steroid pill at 11:00 p.m. and then take a blood test in the morning to see how much cortisol your body still makes. Late-night salivary cortisol level. This test measures cortisol in your saliva. As the name suggests, these tests happen at night. If you have Cushing\'s syndrome, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who will do other blood tests or imaging scans to find out what\'s causing it. Will my symptoms change? If so, how? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? How will we know if they\'re working? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? When will I start to feel better? Does this condition put me at risk for any others? The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. That will lead to how to treat your condition.

101,121,"[""https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/children-and-flu-influenza\nIt's not always easy to tell your child has the flu. The illness comes on fast and is more intense than a cold. Kids tend to feel worse during the first 2 or 3 days they're sick. Symptoms include: A high-grade fever up to 104 degrees F Chills and shakes with the fever Extreme tiredness Headache and body aches Dry, hacking cough Sore throat Vomiting and belly pain Some parents mistake the flu for a stomach bug. That's because unlike adults, children with the flu can have nausea, stomach pain, and vomiting. Three main types of influenza viruses can give you the flu. Types A and B cause the yearly outbreaks. Type C leads to mild, random cases. The flu is highly contagious, particularly when kids share close quarters like they do in school classrooms. It spreads when they inhale droplets that are coughed up or sneezed by an infected person, or when they come in direct contact with mucus or spit from someone who has the flu. Kids can spread the flu a day before their symptoms start, and 5-7 days after they get sick. It can easily move from kid to kid as they share things like pencils, toys, computers, remotes, spoons, and forks. Hand-to-hand contact is another main method. The best way is to get a yearly vaccination. The CDC says all people 6 months and older should get one. Pregnant women and caregivers of children younger than 6 months or of children with certain health conditions should get the vaccine. Yes. Those can include a sinus infection, ear infection, or pneumonia. Call the doctor if your child's fever lasts more than 3 to 4 days. Also call if she complains of trouble breathing, ear pain, a stuffy nose or head, a cough that won't go away, or she seems to be getting worse. Young children under age 2 -- even healthy children -- are more likely than older children to be hospitalized from the complications of the flu. If the doctor thinks your child is likely to have a complication from the flu, he may give her antiviral medicines like baloxavir marboxil ( Xofluza), oseltamivir ( Tamiflu) or zanamivir ( Relenza). They can help if she gets them in the first 2 days of getting sick. They may even shorten the flu by 1 or 2 days. In some cases, they can prevent it. They stop the virus from reproducing, so it can't spread. Still, the best way to prevent the flu is to get the vaccine. Antibiotic drugs don't work. They treat bacterial infections, and the flu is a viral infection. Yes. These treatments can help your kid feel better: Plenty of rest Plenty of liquids Using acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower fever and ease aches -- you can get both in children's versions. Don't give aspirin to children or teenagers. It can boost their risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare disorder that can harm their liver or cause brain damage. The FDA and drug makers say not to give over-the-counter cough and cold medicines to children under age 4. The American Academy of Pediatricians goes higher -- they warn against using them for children younger than 6.

Or he could tell you that you don\'t need any tests. Ask what he thinks is best for you. \x1b[92m[2] If you\'re 40 or older, you should get your eyes checked every 1 to 2 years\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] If you\'ve had eye trouble in the past, or if you\'re at risk for developing it (if someone in your family had it), you should see an eye doctor every year\x1b[0m. Why? You need to check to see if you have serious, sometimes ""silent"" problems that can affect your vision, like: Glaucoma Age-related macular degeneration Cataracts Diabetic retinopathy \x1b[92m[4] If your child has no risk factors for eye problems, she should get her vision checked as a newborn and again at every regular health visit\x1b[0m. By the time she\'s 3, it will be easier for the doctor to assess her eyes. \x1b[92m[5] After the first grade, she should get eye tests every 1 to 2 years\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] If you have a health condition like high blood pressure, work in a job that requires you to use your eyes a lot, or take drugs that can affect eyesight, you may need more frequent exams\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] If you have type 1 diabetes, get your eyes checked within 5 years of your diagnosis and every year after that\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] You\'ll need an exam ASAP if you\'re diagnosed with type 2 diabetes\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] Have your eyes checked every year after that\x1b[0m. When you call to make an appointment for your exam, mention any vision problem you\'re having. Before you go, list any questions you want to ask the doctor. Also be ready to update him or her on any medicines you take and your (and your family\'s) eye health history. Bring your glasses and contact lenses along with the prescription with you. Also bring sunglasses for the trip home. The doctor might use eye drops to open up your pupils. This is called dilation. Your eyes will be sensitive to light afterward. First, the eye doctor or an office staff member will ask you about your medical and vision history. The exam may last from half an hour to several hours, depending on the equipment used. It will cover your vision and your eye health. You\'ll probably have all or most of the following eye tests, and possibly some other ones, too: Eye muscle movement test: This checks your eyes\' alignment. The doctor will watch your eyes move while you follow a target (like a finger tip or his pen) as it moves in different directions. Cover test: This tells how well your eyes work together. You\'ll stare at a small target some distance away. The doctor will cover and uncover each eye to observe how much your eyes move. Your doctor will also be watching for an eye that turns away from the target. This is a condition called strabismus. You may take the test again with a target close to you. External exam and pupil reactions: The doctor will watch how your pupils adjust to light and objects close to you. At the same time, the whites of your eyes and the position of your eyelids will also be checked. Visual acuity test: You\'ll sit in front of an eye chart, with letters that get smaller as you read down each line. You\'ll cover each eye in turn and, using the other eye, read aloud, going down the chart, until you can\'t read the letters anymore. Refraction testing: For your exact lens prescription, the doctor can use a computerized refractor. Your doctor may fine-tune the prescription by flipping the phoropter back and forth between lenses and asking you which is better. If you don\'t need corrective lenses, you won\'t have this test. Slit lamp (biomicroscope): This device magnifies and lights up the front of your eye. The doctor uses it to check your cornea, iris, lens, and the back of your eye, looking for signs of certain eye conditions. Retinal examination ( ophthalmoscopy ): Your doctor may dilate your pupils and use a tool called an ophthalmoscope and to see the back of your eyes -- the retina, retinal blood vessels, fluid in your eyes (he may call this vitreous fluid), and the head of your optic nerve. Glaucoma testing: This procedure checks to see if the fluid pressure inside your eyes is within a normal range. It\'s fast, painless, and can be done in a couple of ways: Tonometer: This is the most accurate. You\'ll get drops to numb your eyes. The doctor will tell you to stare straight ahead and will barely touch the front surface of each eye with a tool called an applanation tonometer or Tonopen to measure the pressure. Puff of air or noncontact tonometer: You\'ll stare at a target, and a machine will let out a small puff of air into each eye. How much your eye resists the puff indicates the pressure inside it. Pachymetry: This test uses ultrasound to measure the thickness of your cornea. Thin corneas can lead to false low-pressure readings. Thick corneas can lead to false high-pressure readings. You\'ll get this test just once to create a baseline for comparison with future readings. It can be used for people who need corneal surgery. Pupil dilation (enlargement): With your pupils fully enlarged, the doctor will use tools and lights to check the insides of your eyes. The eye drops for this part of the exam take about 20-30 minutes to work. They make your eyes more sensitive to light and blur your vision. These effects may last for several hours or longer. This is why you might need those sunglasses on your way home. Newer machine can look in the far back of your retina without your pupils being dilated. Visual field test (perimetry): Your visual field is the area you can see in front of you without moving your eyes. Using one of three tests, the eye doctor maps what you see at the edges (periphery) of your visual field and will use this map to diagnose eye conditions. Ask family or friends who they use.

If you have type 1 diabetes, get your eyes checked within 5 years of your diagnosis and every year after that. You\'ll need an exam ASAP if you\'re diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Have your eyes checked every year after that. When you call to make an appointment for your exam, mention any vision problem you\'re having. Before you go, list any questions you want to ask the doctor. Also be ready to update him or her on any medicines you take and your (and your family\'s) eye health history. Bring your glasses and contact lenses along with the prescription with you. Also bring sunglasses for the trip home. The doctor might use eye drops to open up your pupils. This is called dilation. Your eyes will be sensitive to light afterward. First, the eye doctor or an office staff member will ask you about your medical and vision history. The exam may last from half an hour to several hours, depending on the equipment used. It will cover your vision and your eye health. You\'ll probably have all or most of the following eye tests, and possibly some other ones, too: Eye muscle movement test: This checks your eyes\' alignment. The doctor will watch your eyes move while you follow a target (like a finger tip or his pen) as it moves in different directions. Cover test: This tells how well your eyes work together. You\'ll stare at a small target some distance away. The doctor will cover and uncover each eye to observe how much your eyes move. Your doctor will also be watching for an eye that turns away from the target. This is a condition called strabismus. You may take the test again with a target close to you. External exam and pupil reactions: The doctor will watch how your pupils adjust to light and objects close to you. At the same time, the whites of your eyes and the position of your eyelids will also be checked. Visual acuity test: You\'ll sit in front of an eye chart, with letters that get smaller as you read down each line. You\'ll cover each eye in turn and, using the other eye, read aloud, going down the chart, until you can\'t read the letters anymore. Refraction testing: For your exact lens prescription, the doctor can use a computerized refractor. Your doctor may fine-tune the prescription by flipping the phoropter back and forth between lenses and asking you which is better. If you don\'t need corrective lenses, you won\'t have this test. Slit lamp (biomicroscope): This device magnifies and lights up the front of your eye. The doctor uses it to check your cornea, iris, lens, and the back of your eye, looking for signs of certain eye conditions. Retinal examination ( ophthalmoscopy ): Your doctor may dilate your pupils and use a tool called an ophthalmoscope and to see the back of your eyes -- the retina, retinal blood vessels, fluid in your eyes (he may call this vitreous fluid), and the head of your optic nerve. Glaucoma testing: This procedure checks to see if the fluid pressure inside your eyes is within a normal range. It\'s fast, painless, and can be done in a couple of ways: Tonometer: This is the most accurate. You\'ll get drops to numb your eyes. The doctor will tell you to stare straight ahead and will barely touch the front surface of each eye with a tool called an applanation tonometer or Tonopen to measure the pressure. Puff of air or noncontact tonometer: You\'ll stare at a target, and a machine will let out a small puff of air into each eye. How much your eye resists the puff indicates the pressure inside it. Pachymetry: This test uses ultrasound to measure the thickness of your cornea. Thin corneas can lead to false low-pressure readings. Thick corneas can lead to false high-pressure readings. You\'ll get this test just once to create a baseline for comparison with future readings. It can be used for people who need corneal surgery. Pupil dilation (enlargement): With your pupils fully enlarged, the doctor will use tools and lights to check the insides of your eyes. The eye drops for this part of the exam take about 20-30 minutes to work. They make your eyes more sensitive to light and blur your vision. These effects may last for several hours or longer. This is why you might need those sunglasses on your way home. Newer machine can look in the far back of your retina without your pupils being dilated. Visual field test (perimetry): Your visual field is the area you can see in front of you without moving your eyes. Using one of three tests, the eye doctor maps what you see at the edges (periphery) of your visual field and will use this map to diagnose eye conditions. Ask family or friends who they use.

Once an infected mosquito bites someone, they can get a fever, headaches, and pain in the joints, muscles, bones, and behind the eyes. Some people get a rash and have nausea and vomiting. It sounds awful, but most people recover in a week or so. But if the symptoms get worse and you don\'t see a doctor, it can become life threatening. There is unfortunately no vaccine or cure for dengue fever, so if you think you have it, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take a pain reliever with acetaminophen. Don\'t take aspirin. If you feel worse after the first 24 hours, make sure you get treatment.

Most cases occur in tropical areas of the world, with the greatest risk occurring in: The Indian subcontinent Southeast Asia Southern China Taiwan The Pacific Islands The Caribbean (except Cuba and the Cayman Islands) Mexico Africa Central and South America (except Chile, Paraguay, and Argentina) Most cases in the United States occur in people who contracted the infection while traveling abroad. But the risk is increasing for people living along the Texas- Mexico border and in other parts of the southern United States. In 2014, an outbreak of dengue fever was identified in Hawaii with other outbreaks in 2013 in Brownsville, Texas and Key West, Fla. Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus. The mosquito becomes infected when it bites a person with dengue virus in their blood. It can\'t be spread directly from one person to another person. Symptoms, which usually begin four to six days after infection and last for up to 10 days, may include Sudden, high fever Severe headaches Pain behind the eyes Severe joint and muscle pain Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Skin rash, which appears two to five days after the onset of fever Mild bleeding (such a nose bleed, bleeding gums, or easy bruising) Sometimes, symptoms are mild and can be mistaken for those of the flu or another viral infection. Younger children and people who have never had the infection before tend to have milder cases than older children and adults. However, serious problems can develop. These include dengue hemorrhagic fever, a rare complication characterized by high fever, damage to lymph and blood vessels, bleeding from the nose and gums, enlargement of the liver, and failure of the circulatory system. The symptoms may progress to massive bleeding, shock, and death. This is called dengue shock syndrome ( DSS). People with weakened immune systems as well as those with a second or subsequent dengue infection are believed to be at greater risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever. Doctors can diagnose dengue infection with a blood test to check for the virus or antibodies to it. If you become sick after traveling to a tropical area, let your doctor know. This will allow your doctor to evaluate the possibility that your symptoms were caused by a dengue infection. There is no specific medicine to treat dengue infection. If you think you may have dengue fever, you should use pain relievers with acetaminophen and avoid medicines with aspirin, which could worsen bleeding. You should also rest, drink plenty of fluids, and see your doctor. If you start to feel worse in the first 24 hours after your fever goes down, you should get to a hospital immediately to be checked for complications. The best way to prevent the disease is to prevent bites by infected mosquitoes, particularly if you are living in or traveling to a tropical area. This involves protecting yourself and making efforts to keep the mosquito population down. In 2019, the FDA approved a vaccine called Dengvaxia to help prevent the disease from occurring in adolescents aged 9 to 16 who have already been infected by dengue. But, there currently is no vaccine to prevent the general population from contracting it. To protect yourself: Use mosquito repellents, even indoors. When outdoors, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into socks. When indoors, use air conditioning if available. Make sure window and door screens are secure and free of holes. If sleeping areas are not screened or air conditioned, use mosquito nets. If you have symptoms of dengue, speak to your doctor.

If you start to feel worse in the first 24 hours after your fever goes down, you should get to a hospital immediately to be checked for complications. The best way to prevent the disease is to prevent bites by infected mosquitoes, particularly if you are living in or traveling to a tropical area. This involves protecting yourself and making efforts to keep the mosquito population down. In 2019, the FDA approved a vaccine called Dengvaxia to help prevent the disease from occurring in adolescents aged 9 to 16 who have already been infected by dengue. But, there currently is no vaccine to prevent the general population from contracting it. To protect yourself: Use mosquito repellents, even indoors. When outdoors, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into socks. When indoors, use air conditioning if available. Make sure window and door screens are secure and free of holes. If sleeping areas are not screened or air conditioned, use mosquito nets. If you have symptoms of dengue, speak to your doctor. To reduce the mosquito population, get rid of places where mosquitoes can breed. These include old tires, cans, or flower pots that collect rain. Regularly change the water in outdoor bird baths and pets\' water dishes. If someone in your home gets dengue fever, be especially vigilant about efforts to protect yourself and other family members from mosquitoes. Mosquitoes that bite the infected family member could spread the infection to others in your home.']",['https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dengue-fever-reference'],"['https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dengue-fever-reference\nDengue (pronounced DENgee) fever is a painful, debilitating mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses. These viruses are related to the viruses that cause West Nile infection and yellow fever. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context[\'wb.modimp\'] = \'vidfloat\'; Mayo Clinic: "" Dengue Fever. ""; CDC: "" Dengue - Frequently Asked Questions."" MICHAEL SMITH: If you\'re packing for a trip somewhere nice and warm, don\'t forget your bug spray. That will help keep you safe from dengue fever, a virus spread by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Once an infected mosquito bites someone, they can get a fever, headaches, and pain in the joints, muscles, bones, and behind the eyes. Some people get a rash and have nausea and vomiting. It sounds awful, but most people recover in a week or so. But if the symptoms get worse and you don\'t see a doctor, it can become life threatening. There is unfortunately no vaccine or cure for dengue fever, so if you think you have it, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take a pain reliever with acetaminophen. Don\'t take aspirin. If you feel worse after the first 24 hours, make sure you get treatment.

Most cases occur in tropical areas of the world, with the greatest risk occurring in: The Indian subcontinent Southeast Asia Southern China Taiwan The Pacific Islands The Caribbean (except Cuba and the Cayman Islands) Mexico Africa Central and South America (except Chile, Paraguay, and Argentina) Most cases in the United States occur in people who contracted the infection while traveling abroad. But the risk is increasing for people living along the Texas- Mexico border and in other parts of the southern United States. In 2014, an outbreak of dengue fever was identified in Hawaii with other outbreaks in 2013 in Brownsville, Texas and Key West, Fla. Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus. The mosquito becomes infected when it bites a person with dengue virus in their blood. It can\'t be spread directly from one person to another person. Symptoms, which usually begin four to six days after infection and last for up to 10 days, may include Sudden, high fever Severe headaches Pain behind the eyes Severe joint and muscle pain Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Skin rash, which appears two to five days after the onset of fever Mild bleeding (such a nose bleed, bleeding gums, or easy bruising) Sometimes, symptoms are mild and can be mistaken for those of the flu or another viral infection. Younger children and people who have never had the infection before tend to have milder cases than older children and adults. However, serious problems can develop. These include dengue hemorrhagic fever, a rare complication characterized by high fever, damage to lymph and blood vessels, bleeding from the nose and gums, enlargement of the liver, and failure of the circulatory system. The symptoms may progress to massive bleeding, shock, and death. This is called dengue shock syndrome ( DSS). People with weakened immune systems as well as those with a second or subsequent dengue infection are believed to be at greater risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever. Doctors can diagnose dengue infection with a blood test to check for the virus or antibodies to it. If you become sick after traveling to a tropical area, let your doctor know. This will allow your doctor to evaluate the possibility that your symptoms were caused by a dengue infection. There is no specific medicine to treat dengue infection. If you think you may have dengue fever, you should use pain relievers with acetaminophen and avoid medicines with aspirin, which could worsen bleeding. You should also rest, drink plenty of fluids, and see your doctor.

105,160,"[""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/surgeries-that-treat-cervical-cancer\nIf you have cervical cancer, there are a number of ways your doctor can treat your condition. Which one he recommends will depend on what type of cervical cancer you have, your age, and whether or not you might want to have children in the future. It will also depend on whether, or how far, the cancer has spread. Doctors call this the √¢\x80\x9cstage√¢\x80\x9d it's in. Surgery is just one option to discuss with your doctor. Your doctor uses a gas called liquid nitrogen to freeze the abnormal cancer cells on your cervix. An √¢\x80\x9cice ball√¢\x80\x9d forms, and the bad cells die. Your doctor can perform this procedure in his office or clinic. You can go home after the procedure. You may have a watery discharge for a few weeks. Cryosurgery is typically used during stage 0, which means your doctor has found abnormal cells only on the surface of your cervix. This is performed in your doctor's office or clinic and is usually reserved for stage 0 cervical cancer. Your doctor uses a laser beam to burn off the cancer cells on your cervix. He may also cut a small piece of tissue to examine in a lab. He'll numb your cervix so you won't have any pain. Your doctor may do this before he recommends chemotherapy or radiation. If you want to be able to have kids later, it may be the only treatment he recommends. Your doctor uses a surgical or laser knife to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix. He may also use a thin wire heated by electricity. This is called the loop electrosurgical excision procedure, or LEEP. He'll look at your tissue sample under a microscope. If the edges of the cone have cancer cells, some of the cancer may have been left behind. Your doctor may then recommend chemo or radiation. In this procedure, a surgeon removes your uterus and cervix. Your other reproductive organs -- your ovaries and fallopian tubes -- are left in place, unless there's a medical reason they should be removed, too. Surgeons perform hysterectomies in one of three ways: through a cut in the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy); through the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy); or with the help of robotic instruments (laparoscopic hysterectomy). You'll have to stay in the hospital after your surgery. With a laparoscopic or vaginal hysterectomy, you'll have a 1- or 2-day stay. Full recovery time is about 2 to 3 weeks. After an abdominal hysterectomy, you'll stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 days. Recovery time is longer -- about 4 to 6 weeks. Complications are rare, but can include excessive bleeding, infection, or damage to your urinary system or intestines. During this surgery, the surgeon removes your uterus and the tissues next to it. He'll also remove about 1 inch of the vagina next to your cervix. And, he may take some of the lymph nodes from your pelvic area. These are pockets of immune system tissue that are about the size of a pea. He'll leave your ovaries and fallopian tubes, unless it's medically necessary to take them, too. Most of the time, this surgery is performed through your abdomen. But your doctor may be able to use laparoscopy to remove your uterus through your vagina. This results in less blood loss, and maybe a shorter hospital stay. Full recovery time is 4 to 6 weeks. Call your doctor right away if you have excessive bleeding, trouble peeing, or believe your wound is infected. If you still want to be able to have kids, your doctor may recommend a trachelectomy. The surgeon removes your cervix and the top part of your vagina, but he leaves your uterus intact. He places a stitch, or a band, where your cervix had been. This opening leads to your uterus. He may also remove the lymph nodes near your cervix or uterus. He'll perform this surgery either through your vagina or through a cut in your abdomen.

Which one he recommends will depend on what type of cervical cancer you have, your age, and whether or not you might want to have children in the future. It will also depend on whether, or how far, the cancer has spread. Doctors call this the √¢\x80\x9cstage√¢\x80\x9d it's in. Surgery is just one option to discuss with your doctor. Your doctor uses a gas called liquid nitrogen to freeze the abnormal cancer cells on your cervix. An √¢\x80\x9cice ball√¢\x80\x9d forms, and the bad cells die. Your doctor can perform this procedure in his office or clinic. You can go home after the procedure. You may have a watery discharge for a few weeks. Cryosurgery is typically used during stage 0, which means your doctor has found abnormal cells only on the surface of your cervix. This is performed in your doctor's office or clinic and is usually reserved for stage 0 cervical cancer. Your doctor uses a laser beam to burn off the cancer cells on your cervix. He may also cut a small piece of tissue to examine in a lab. He'll numb your cervix so you won't have any pain. Your doctor may do this before he recommends chemotherapy or radiation. If you want to be able to have kids later, it may be the only treatment he recommends. Your doctor uses a surgical or laser knife to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix. He may also use a thin wire heated by electricity. This is called the loop electrosurgical excision procedure, or LEEP. He'll look at your tissue sample under a microscope. If the edges of the cone have cancer cells, some of the cancer may have been left behind. Your doctor may then recommend chemo or radiation. In this procedure, a surgeon removes your uterus and cervix. Your other reproductive organs -- your ovaries and fallopian tubes -- are left in place, unless there's a medical reason they should be removed, too. Surgeons perform hysterectomies in one of three ways: through a cut in the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy); through the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy); or with the help of robotic instruments (laparoscopic hysterectomy). You'll have to stay in the hospital after your surgery. With a laparoscopic or vaginal hysterectomy, you'll have a 1- or 2-day stay. Full recovery time is about 2 to 3 weeks. After an abdominal hysterectomy, you'll stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 days. Recovery time is longer -- about 4 to 6 weeks. Complications are rare, but can include excessive bleeding, infection, or damage to your urinary system or intestines. During this surgery, the surgeon removes your uterus and the tissues next to it. He'll also remove about 1 inch of the vagina next to your cervix. And, he may take some of the lymph nodes from your pelvic area. These are pockets of immune system tissue that are about the size of a pea. He'll leave your ovaries and fallopian tubes, unless it's medically necessary to take them, too. Most of the time, this surgery is performed through your abdomen. But your doctor may be able to use laparoscopy to remove your uterus through your vagina. This results in less blood loss, and maybe a shorter hospital stay. Full recovery time is 4 to 6 weeks. Call your doctor right away if you have excessive bleeding, trouble peeing, or believe your wound is infected. If you still want to be able to have kids, your doctor may recommend a trachelectomy. The surgeon removes your cervix and the top part of your vagina, but he leaves your uterus intact. He places a stitch, or a band, where your cervix had been. This opening leads to your uterus. He may also remove the lymph nodes near your cervix or uterus. He'll perform this surgery either through your vagina or through a cut in your abdomen. The chance of your cancer coming back after this operation is very low. Studies show that women who have a trachelectomy have a 50% chance of getting pregnant 5 years later.

It needs to keep you stable enough to stand upright but flexible enough for movement. So it's no surprise that many people have back problems from time to time. The hurt can stem from sore muscles, ligaments, and tendons, or from herniated disks, fractures, and other problems in your upper, middle, and lower back. Sometimes you feel the effects right away. But in many cases, back problems develop over time. We often bring on our back problems through bad habits, such as: Poor posture, like sitting incorrectly at a desk or behind the steering wheel Repeating the same motion or overdoing it Pushing, pulling, and lifting things carelessly The spine is actually a stack of 24 bones called vertebrae. A healthy spine is S-shaped when viewed from the side. It curves back at your shoulders and inward at your neck and small of your back. It houses and protects your spinal cord, the network of nerves that transmit feeling and control movement throughout your entire body. One of the more common types of back pain comes from straining the bands of muscles surrounding the spine. It happens most often in the curve of the low back and the base of the neck. These areas support more weight than your upper and mid back, which are less prone to trouble. Injuries from contact sports, accidents, and falls can cause problems ranging from minor muscle strains, to herniated disks, to fractures that damage to the spinal column or cord. Stabbing low back pain could be from muscle spasms, when your muscles seize up and don't relax, like a cramp. Osteoarthritis can affect your vertebrae, when the cartilage between them wears down. Bone spurs or a herniated disk can push on nerves. Pregnancy often brings on back pain, too. Hormonal changes and weight gain put new kinds of stresses on a pregnant woman's spine and legs. Sometimes your back might be sore for no clear reason. That's called nonspecific backache. It could come from weak muscles that can't handle everyday walking, bending, and stretching. Back pain -- whether a dull ache or shooting -- is just one sign that something's going on with your back. You may also have feelings in your legs or arms: Radiating pain Numbness Tingling Weakness Uncontrolled peeing or pooping could mean a serious problem like spinal cord compression. Call your doctor right away. You should see a doctor: After you get hurt, like in a fall or accident When the pain gets in the way of your daily activities If it lasts longer than 6 weeks, or spreads During your exam, your doctor will test your range of motion -- unless you can't move -- and check how well your nerves are working. That may be enough to decide what to do next. You might need imaging tests, like X-rays, an MRI, or a CT scan. But they're not always useful, and there's not always a direct link between the results of these tests and how much it hurts. Your specific treatment will depend on what's causing your pain and where in your back it is. Despite what you may think or have been told before, staying in bed isn't usually the answer; gentle exercise is. It will help work out the kinks, build support for your spine, and improve your flexibility. A physical therapist can work with you to design a set of exercises, give you relief from the pain, and get you moving again. Over-the-counter pain relievers, ice, and heat will work to take the edge off most back pain. Your doctor can prescribe stronger medicines, but some can make you drowsy or dependent on them if you're not careful. Complementary therapies, such as chiropractic spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage, can help ease pain, too. If a bone is damaged, or you have a herniated disk or pinched nerve, you may need surgery. But for ongoing back pain, doctors will try other treatments first.

But they're not always useful, and there's not always a direct link between the results of these tests and how much it hurts. Your specific treatment will depend on what's causing your pain and where in your back it is. Despite what you may think or have been told before, staying in bed isn't usually the answer; gentle exercise is. It will help work out the kinks, build support for your spine, and improve your flexibility. A physical therapist can work with you to design a set of exercises, give you relief from the pain, and get you moving again. Over-the-counter pain relievers, ice, and heat will work to take the edge off most back pain. Your doctor can prescribe stronger medicines, but some can make you drowsy or dependent on them if you're not careful. Complementary therapies, such as chiropractic spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage, can help ease pain, too. If a bone is damaged, or you have a herniated disk or pinched nerve, you may need surgery. But for ongoing back pain, doctors will try other treatments first. Counseling could help you learn to live with chronic pain better as well as deal with symptoms of depression because of it. \x1b[92m[1] Exercise!\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] Strengthening the muscles around your spine and in your core will help keep you stable and balanced\x1b[0m. Walking is great for your low back, and it's simple to do. \x1b[92m[3] Practice good posture\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] As a rule of thumb, aim to keep your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned when you sit, stand, and walk\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Lift heavy things correctly, using your hips and knees for power while keeping your back straight\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Try sleeping on your side, with a medium-firm mattress\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Don't smoke\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] It restricts blood flow, so your muscles and tissues don't get a good supply of nutrients and oxygen\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] That can lead to weakness and aches\x1b[0m.

It has a wire loop on the end. \x1b[92m[2] An electric current heats the wire loop so your doctor can remove (excise) some cells and tissue on your cervix or in your vagina\x1b[0m.

You may also get one \x1b[92m[4] if your doctor found something unusual during an examination of your vagina\x1b[0m. Doctors use LEEP to diagnose or treat abnormal things, including cells that look like they might become cancer. Before you agree to get one, make sure your doctor explains: Why they want you to have one What the results could mean What the risks, benefits, and complications could be Who will do it If there are other options A LEEP usually takes about 10 to 20 minutes. In most cases, you can have it done at your doctor's office. You'll lie on the exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to open your vagina, as if you were getting a Pap smear. Your doctor will look at your cervix and the inside of your vagina using something called a colposcope. It looks a little bit like a microscope, and it lets your doctor look at the cells close up. Your doctor will put it near your vagina, but not inside. To get a good look at the cells, your doctor may clean and soak your cervix with a vinegary liquid. It can make abnormal cells turn white and make them easier to see. It may sting a little. Then you'll get a small shot in the area to numb it. Next, your doctor will put the LEEP tool through the speculum into your vagina and take out abnormal tissue. How much your doctor takes depends on whether they're using the LEEP to figure out what's wrong or to treat the problem. During the LEEP, you may feel cramps or like there is pressure inside. Some women feel faint. Tell your doctor if you get lightheaded or you feel like you might pass out. \x1b[92m[6] You'll be able to go home right after it's done\x1b[0m.

111,173,"[""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma\nAnaplastic large-cell lymphoma ( ALCL) is \x1b[92m[1] a rare type of blood cancer\x1b[0m. It's \x1b[92m[2] more common in young people, mostly boys\x1b[0m. It doesn't run in families. ALCL is a serious illness. It can be fast growing, and it often returns. Treatments can help you fight it. Other therapies can help you feel better. Scientists are still looking for new and better ways to treat both the disease and the symptoms. When you have lymphoma, cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. These are white blood cells that usually fight infection. With ALCL, they build up in small glands called lymph nodes or in other parts of your body, like your lungs or skin. ALCL \x1b[92m[3] can show up in two ways: In the skin, it's called cutaneous ALCL\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] It usually grows slowly\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] In the lymph nodes and other organs, it's called systemic ALCL\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] It often spreads quickly\x1b[0m. Doctors will also need to find out whether your cancer has a certain protein, called ALK. ALK-positive cancers are more common in young people and usually respond well to chemotherapy. ALK-negative cancers are more common people over 60. This type may need stronger treatment because it is more likely to come back. Researchers don't know what causes ALCL, but they do know it isn't inherited. Often, the first sign of systemic ALCL is swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin, where your legs meet the trunk of your body. You may also have symptoms like: Fatigue Fever Loss of appetite Night sweats Weight loss With cutaneous ALCL, you may first notice one or more raised, red bumps on the skin that don't go away. These are tumors. They can form open sores, and they may itch. When you come in for a visit, your doctor will want to know: When did you first notice changes? Are there any swollen glands? Is there pain? Where? What about appetite? Any weight loss? More tired than usual? Any skin bumps? Do they itch? To see if you have ALCL, doctors may take a biopsy from a swollen lymph node. It's quick and doesn't require a hospital stay. Doctors make a small cut in the skin and remove all or part of the lymph node, or use a needle to take a sample. They look at the cells under a microscope. Other tests may be needed, such as: Blood tests Bone marrow biopsy. Doctors use a special needle to remove a small amount of the soft material inside your bones and check it for cancer cells. Chest X-ray, which uses radiation in low doses to make images of organs in your chest. CT. A powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. MRI, which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures. PET scan, in which radioactive materials called tracers look for cancer. These tests look to see where and how much the cancer has spread. This is called staging. It helps you and your doctor decide the right treatment. Stage I. Cancer is found in lymph nodes in only one part of the body, like the neck or groin. Stage II. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes. All of the lymph nodes are either above or below the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle between your chest and stomach. Stage III. Cancer is found in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm. Stage IV. ALCL has spread to other organs, such as the liver, bones, or lungs. What stage is the cancer? Where exactly have you found cancer? Is it ALK-positive? Have you treated someone with ALCL before? What treatment do you recommend? What are the side effects? How and when will we know if it works? What if it doesn't work? Could I be in a clinical trial? How do I connect with other families facing ALCL? No matter what form of ALCL you have, there are treatments to help. And researchers are hopeful to have new and better options in the future. Your treatment choices will depend on the type of ALCL you have and where it is in the body. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for systemic ALCL, when the cancer is in your lymph nodes and other parts of the body. A kind of chemotherapy called CHOP is used for both ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL. The therapy gets its name for the first letters of the drugs it uses: Cytoxan, hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, and prednisolone. If your cancer is ALK-negative, doctors may use CHOP at higher doses. If your cancer doesn't respond to CHOP, you may get another drug called brentuximab vedotin ( Adcetris). A stem cell transplant may also be an option for you, but it's a complicated and risky procedure. It's usually only done when other treatments have failed. Doctors inject stem cells into your body to help you grow new cancer-free ones. The stem cells come from your own body, or from a closely matched donor. For primary cutaneous ALCL, treatment may include: Radiation, which uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells Surgery to remove the tumors If the cancer is in many areas of the skin, you may need a combination of chemotherapy drugs. Being diagnosed with cancer can make you feel like you've lost control. Remember that you're in charge of your treatment decisions and how you live your life. While you are getting treatment, you may not feel your best. Some treatments, like chemotherapy, have side effects. You may feel weak or tired, and you may be sick to your stomach To help you feel better: Eat enough calories and protein each day to keep up weight and stay strong. Try several small meals instead of fewer bigger ones. Ask the doctor or nurse for ways to ease nausea and other side effects of treatment. Get support from friends, family members, counselors, or members of your spiritual community. \x1b[92m[7] You can also join a support group of other people with ALCL\x1b[0m. Stay active. Exercise when you feel up to it. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you. Try to get good rest. Wash hands often, and stay away from people who may be sick. Don't miss regular doctor appointments. They're key to finding out how well the treatment is going, and to deciding if any changes are needed. Every situation is different, but treatment to fight ALCL can work well. Sometimes, the cancer comes back. Ask your doctor what to watch for, and listen to your body. The treatments can bring discomfort. Make sure your doctor knows how you're feeling. Take advantage of other therapies that can ease symptoms and help you feel better. A serious illness is hard for the whole family. It's natural that you will have questions, concerns, and frustrations. Find the support you need, and ask for help when you need it.

ALK-negative cancers are more common people over 60. This type may need stronger treatment because it is more likely to come back. Researchers don't know what causes ALCL, but they do know it isn't inherited. Often, the first sign of systemic ALCL is swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin, where your legs meet the trunk of your body. You may also have symptoms like: Fatigue Fever Loss of appetite Night sweats Weight loss With cutaneous ALCL, you may first notice one or more raised, red bumps on the skin that don't go away. These are tumors. They can form open sores, and they may itch. When you come in for a visit, your doctor will want to know: When did you first notice changes? Are there any swollen glands? Is there pain? Where? What about appetite? Any weight loss? More tired than usual? Any skin bumps? Do they itch? To see if you have ALCL, doctors may take a biopsy from a swollen lymph node. It's quick and doesn't require a hospital stay. Doctors make a small cut in the skin and remove all or part of the lymph node, or use a needle to take a sample. They look at the cells under a microscope. Other tests may be needed, such as: Blood tests Bone marrow biopsy. Doctors use a special needle to remove a small amount of the soft material inside your bones and check it for cancer cells. Chest X-ray, which uses radiation in low doses to make images of organs in your chest. CT. A powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. MRI, which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures. PET scan, in which radioactive materials called tracers look for cancer. These tests look to see where and how much the cancer has spread. This is called staging. It helps you and your doctor decide the right treatment. Stage I. Cancer is found in lymph nodes in only one part of the body, like the neck or groin. Stage II. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes. All of the lymph nodes are either above or below the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle between your chest and stomach. Stage III. Cancer is found in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm. Stage IV. ALCL has spread to other organs, such as the liver, bones, or lungs. What stage is the cancer? Where exactly have you found cancer? Is it ALK-positive? Have you treated someone with ALCL before? What treatment do you recommend? What are the side effects? How and when will we know if it works? What if it doesn't work? Could I be in a clinical trial? How do I connect with other families facing ALCL? No matter what form of ALCL you have, there are treatments to help. And researchers are hopeful to have new and better options in the future. Your treatment choices will depend on the type of ALCL you have and where it is in the body. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for systemic ALCL, when the cancer is in your lymph nodes and other parts of the body. A kind of chemotherapy called CHOP is used for both ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL. The therapy gets its name for the first letters of the drugs it uses: Cytoxan, hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, and prednisolone. If your cancer is ALK-negative, doctors may use CHOP at higher doses. If your cancer doesn't respond to CHOP, you may get another drug called brentuximab vedotin ( Adcetris). A stem cell transplant may also be an option for you, but it's a complicated and risky procedure. It's usually only done when other treatments have failed. Doctors inject stem cells into your body to help you grow new cancer-free ones. The stem cells come from your own body, or from a closely matched donor. For primary cutaneous ALCL, treatment may include: Radiation, which uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells Surgery to remove the tumors If the cancer is in many areas of the skin, you may need a combination of chemotherapy drugs. Being diagnosed with cancer can make you feel like you've lost control. Remember that you're in charge of your treatment decisions and how you live your life. While you are getting treatment, you may not feel your best. Some treatments, like chemotherapy, have side effects. You may feel weak or tired, and you may be sick to your stomach To help you feel better: Eat enough calories and protein each day to keep up weight and stay strong. Try several small meals instead of fewer bigger ones. Ask the doctor or nurse for ways to ease nausea and other side effects of treatment. Get support from friends, family members, counselors, or members of your spiritual community. You can also join a support group of other people with ALCL. Stay active. Exercise when you feel up to it. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you. Try to get good rest. Wash hands often, and stay away from people who may be sick. Don't miss regular doctor appointments. They're key to finding out how well the treatment is going, and to deciding if any changes are needed. Every situation is different, but treatment to fight ALCL can work well. Sometimes, the cancer comes back. Ask your doctor what to watch for, and listen to your body. The treatments can bring discomfort. Make sure your doctor knows how you're feeling. Take advantage of other therapies that can ease symptoms and help you feel better. A serious illness is hard for the whole family. It's natural that you will have questions, concerns, and frustrations. Find the support you need, and ask for help when you need it. Keep informed about research that's under way. You may be able to take part in a clinical trial. You can find out more information on anaplastic large-cell lymphoma on the web site of the Lymphoma Research Foundation. It has links to help you find the support of people and families who have ALCL, and to information about clinical trials.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma\nAnaplastic large-cell lymphoma ( ALCL) is \x1b[92m[1] a rare type of blood cancer\x1b[0m. It's \x1b[92m[2] more common in young people, mostly boys\x1b[0m. It doesn't run in families. ALCL is a serious illness. It can be fast growing, and it often returns. Treatments can help you fight it. Other therapies can help you feel better. Scientists are still looking for new and better ways to treat both the disease and the symptoms. When you have lymphoma, cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. These are white blood cells that usually fight infection. With ALCL, they build up in small glands called lymph nodes or in other parts of your body, like your lungs or skin. ALCL \x1b[92m[3] can show up in two ways: In the skin, it's called cutaneous ALCL\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] It usually grows slowly\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] In the lymph nodes and other organs, it's called systemic ALCL\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] It often spreads quickly\x1b[0m.

113,99,"[""https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/black-hairy-tongue\nThe name black hairy tongue may sound scary, but the condition is harmless. Black hairy tongue is caused by bacteria or fungi in the mouth, which make the tongue appear black and hairy. It's easily remedied by good old-fashioned oral hygiene. A black hairy tongue is caused by too much bacteria or yeast growth in the mouth. The bacteria build up on tiny rounded projections called papillae. These lie along the surface of the tongue. Instead of shedding as they normally do, the papillae start to grow and lengthen, creating hair-like projections. They can grow to 15 times their normal length. Normally, the papillae are pinkish-white. But as they grow, pigments from food, drinks, and possibly the bacteria or yeast themselves get caught in the papillae, dyeing the tongue a color. Most often that color is black, hence the name. But the tongue can also turn brown, yellow, green, or a variety of other colors. Certain lifestyle habits and conditions can make people more likely to develop black hairy tongue. They include: poor oral hygiene smoking tobacco drinking a lot of coffee or tea using antibiotics (which may disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the mouth) being dehydrated taking medications that contain the chemical bismuth (such as Pepto- Bismol for upset stomach) not producing enough saliva regularly using mouthwash that contains peroxide, witch hazel, or menthol getting radiation therapy to the head and neck Black hairy tongue is more common in men, people who use intravenous drugs, and those who are HIV-positive. Other than the appearance of the tongue, most people with black hairy tongue don't have any symptoms or feel any discomfort. The exception is when there is too much growth of the yeast Candida albicans, which can cause a burning sensation on the tongue. This burning sensation is called glossopyrosis. Some people complain of a tickling feeling in the back of the roof of the mouth, a metallic taste in their mouth, or nausea. In more severe cases, the condition may lead to a gagging feeling. Sometimes, food getting caught inside the extra-long papillae can cause bad breath. Practicing good oral hygiene is the best way to treat black hairy tongue. Gently brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Also, brush your tongue. You can use a tongue scraper to make sure you're thoroughly cleaning the area. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help keep your mouth clean. Other tips include: If you smoke, quit. Add more roughage to your diet. Soft foods won't clean off the tongue effectively. \x1b[92m[1] Call your doctor or dentist if the problem doesn't get better on its own\x1b[0m. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or an antifungal drug to get rid of the bacteria or yeast. Topical medications, such as tretinoin ( Retin- A), are also sometimes prescribed.

114,163,"[""https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-a-mri\nMagnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is a test that uses powerful magnets, radio waves, and a computer to make detailed pictures inside your body. Your doctor can use this test to diagnose you or to see how well you've responded to treatment. Unlike X-rays and computed tomography ( CT) scans, MRIs do not use the damaging ionizing radiation of X-rays. A MRI \x1b[92m[1] helps a doctor diagnose a disease or injury, and it can monitor how well you're doing with a treatment\x1b[0m. MRIs can be done on different parts of your body. It's \x1b[92m[2] especially useful for looking at soft tissues and the nervous system\x1b[0m. A MRI of the brain and spinal cord looks for: Blood vessel damage Brain injury Cancer Multiple sclerosis Spinal cord injuries Stroke A MRI of the heart and blood vessels looks for: Blocked blood vessels Damage caused by a heart attack Heart disease Problems with the structure of the heart A MRI of the bones and joints looks for: Bone infections Cancer Damage to joints Disc problems in the spine Neck or low back pain with nerve signs MRIs can also be done to check the health of these organs: Breasts (women) Liver Kidneys Ovaries (women) Pancreas Prostate (men) A special kind of MRI called a functional MRI (f MRI\x1b[92m[6] ) maps brain activity. This test looks at\x1b[0m blood flow in your brain to see which areas become active when you do certain tasks. A f MRI \x1b[92m[7] can detect brain problems, such as the effects of a stroke, or for brain mapping if you need brain surgery for epilepsy or tumors\x1b[0m. Your doctor can use this test to plan your treatment. Before your MRI, let your doctor know if you: Have any health problems, such as kidney or liver disease Recently had surgery Have any allergies to food or medicine, or if you have asthma Are pregnant, or might be pregnant No metal is allowed in the MRI room, because the magnetic field in the machine can attract metal. Tell your doctor whether you have any metal-based devices that might cause problems during the test. These can include: Artificial heart valves Body piercings Cochlear implants Drug pumps Fillings and other dental work Implanted nerve stimulator Insulin pump Metal fragments, such as a bullet or shrapnel Metal joints or limbs Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) Pins or screws If you have tattoos, talk with your doctor. Some inks contain metal On the day of the test, wear loose, comfortable clothing that doesn't have snaps or other metal fasteners. You might need to take off your own clothes and wear a gown during the test. Remove all of these before you go into the MRI room: Cell phone Coins Dentures Eyeglasses Hearing aids Keys Underwire bra Watch Wig If you don't like enclosed spaces or you're nervous about the test, tell your doctor. You may be able to have an open MRI or get medicine to relax you before the test. A typical MRI machine is a large tube with a hole at both ends. A magnet surrounds the tube. You lie on a table that slides all the way into the tube. In a short-bore system, you are not totally inside the MRI machine. Only the part of your body that's being scanned is inside. The rest of your body is outside the machine. An open MRI is open on all sides. This type of machine may be best if you have claustrophobia -- a fear of tight spaces -- or you're very overweight. The quality of images from some open MRI machines isn't as good as it is with a closed MRI. Before some MRIs, you'll get contrast dye into a vein in your arm or hand. This dye helps the doctor more clearly see structures inside your body. The dye often used in MRIs is called gadolinium. It can leave a metal taste in your mouth. You will lie on a table that slides into the MRI machine. Straps might be used to hold you still during the test. Your body might be completely inside the machine. Or, part of your body may stay outside the machine. The MRI machine creates a strong magnetic field inside your body. A computer takes the signals from the MRI and uses them to make a series of pictures. Each picture shows a thin slice of your body. You might hear a loud thumping or tapping sound during the test. This is the machine creating energy to take pictures inside your body. You can ask for earplugs or headphones to muffle the sound. You might feel a twitching sensation during the test. This happens as the MRI stimulates nerves in your body. It's normal, and nothing to worry about. The MRI scan should take between 20 and 90 minutes. Pregnant women should not get a MRI during their first trimester unless they absolutely need the test. The first trimester is when the baby's organs develop. You also shouldn't get contrast dye when you're pregnant. Don't get contrast dye if you've had an allergic reaction to it in the past or you have severe kidney disease. Certain people with metal inside their body can't get this test, including those with: Some clips used to treat brain aneurysms Pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators Cochlear implants Certain metal coils placed in blood vessels A specially trained doctor called a radiologist will read the results of your MRI and send the report to your doctor.

Probably 95% of knee pain caused by arthritis is osteoarthritis, which is caused by √¢\x80\x9cwear and tear√¢\x80\x9d on the joints. Other types, like rheumatoid arthritis, are much less common causes of knee pain. What kind of injuries can cause knee pain? They're usually twisting injuries to the knee: ACL, meniscus, or ligament injuries. What's the difference? The main difference between arthritis and other kinds of knee pain is there's no trauma associated with it. A person who tore their ACL or had a meniscus injury knows exactly when it happened. With arthritis, it's more of a dull, aching pain. It gets worse as time goes on. Will my pain go away on its own? It depends. Arthritis pain tends to wax and wane over time. It may not completely go away, but sometimes it feels much better. Pain from an injury improves at first, but if you're left with a sore joint, you may not be able to do certain activities. When do I need to see a doctor? Everyone has a different pain threshold. \x1b[92m[1] If you've an injury and your knee swells, you need to see your doctor\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Even if the swelling goes away, you need to have your knee examined -- you might have injured something inside the joint\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] If you have arthritis pain and the bad days outnumber the good, you should see your doctor\x1b[0m. How do I keep my knees healthy? I think weight control is important. Flexibility helps as well. If you take part in a sport that requires a lot of physical exertion, like skiing or tennis or soccer, you need to get in shape. Also, when you get tired, you need to stop. Look at the rate of knee injury: It goes up in the fourth quarter or final period of a game. Just a millisecond or two of delay of muscle function can cause injury. If the muscles that protect the ligament are tired, they don't do a good job.""]",When do I need to see a doctor about my knee pain?,"[92m""If you've an injury and your knee swells, you need to see your doctor"" [1][0m. [92m""Even if the swelling goes away, you need to have your knee examined -- you might have injured something inside the joint"" [2][0m. [92m""If you have arthritis pain and the bad days outnumber the good, you should see your doctor"" [3][0m.","""If you've an injury and your knee swells, you need to see your doctor.""

If you\'ve got too much flab or excess skin in your abdomen that doesn\'t respond to diet or exercise, you may be considering a ""tummy tuck,"" which doctors call ""abdominoplasty."" This surgery flattens the abdomen by removing extra fat and skin, and tightening muscles in your abdominal wall. It\'s not the same as liposuction, although you may choose to get liposuction along with a tummy tuck. This is a major surgery, so if you\'re considering it, you should know the facts before you decide whether to go forward. A tummy tuck is suitable for men and women who are in good health. Women who have had several pregnancies may find the procedure useful for tightening their abdominal muscles and reducing skin. A tummy tuck is also an option for men or women who were once obese and still have excess fat deposits or loose skin around the belly. If you\'re a woman who plans to get pregnant, then you may want to postpone a tummy tuck until you\'re done having children. During surgery, your vertical muscles are tightened, and future pregnancies can separate those muscles. Are you planning to lose a lot of weight? Then a tummy tuck also is not for you. A tummy tuck should be a last resort after you\'ve tried everything else. It should not be used as an alternative to weight loss. You should also consider the appearance of scars after a tummy tuck. You can talk about scar placement and length with the doctor before the surgery. The first step is to choose a surgeon and see him or her for a consultation. At that meeting, you\'ll talk about your goals and the following options: Complete abdominoplasty. The surgeon will cut your abdomen from hipbone to hipbone and then contour the skin, tissue, and muscle as needed. The surgery will involve moving your belly button, and you may need drainage tubes under your skin for a few days. Partial or mini abdominoplasty. Mini-abdominoplasties are often done on people whose fat deposits are located below the navel. During this procedure, the surgeon most likely will not move your belly button, and the procedure may only take up to two hours, depending on your case. \x1b[92m[1] If you smoke, your doctor will ask that you quit smoking from at least two weeks before the surgery until two weeks after the surgery\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] It is not enough to just cut down on smoking\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] You must stop completely since smoking makes complications more likely and slows healing\x1b[0m. Don\'t try a drastic diet before the surgery. Eat well-balanced, complete meals. A healthy diet may help you heal better. Tell your doctor about everything you take, including prescription drugs, herbal medicines, and other supplements. Your surgeon may instruct you to stop taking certain medications for a time before and after the surgery. Before getting the surgery, get your home ready. You\'ll need: Ice packs Loose, comfortable clothing that can be put on and off very easily Petroleum jelly Hand-held shower head and bathroom chair You\'ll also need someone to drive you home after the tummy tuck. If you live alone, you\'ll want someone to stay with you for at least the first night. Make a plan for that. This surgery can take anywhere from one to five hours. You may need to stay overnight in the hospital, depending on your case. You will get general anesthesia, which will put you to ""sleep"" during the operation. You will have pain and swelling in the days following surgery. Your doctor will prescribe pain medicine and tell you how to best handle the pain. You may be sore for several weeks or months. You may also experience numbness, bruising, and tiredness during that time. As with any surgery, there are risks. Though they\'re rare, complications can include infection, bleeding under the skin flap, or blood clots. You may be more likely to have complications if you have poor circulation, diabetes, or heart, lung, or liver disease. You may experience insufficient healing, which can cause more significant scarring or loss of skin. If you do heal poorly, you may require a second surgery. A tummy tuck leaves scars. Though they may fade slightly, they will never completely disappear. Your surgeon may recommend certain creams or ointments to use after you\'ve completely healed to help with scars. Whether you\'re having a partial or complete tummy tuck, the area that\'s operated on will be stitched and bandaged. It\'s very important to follow all your surgeon\'s instructions on how to care for the bandage in the days following surgery. The bandage used will be a firm, elastic band that promotes proper healing. Your surgeon will also instruct you on how to best position yourself while sitting or lying down to help ease pain. You will have to severely limit strenuous activity for at least six weeks. You may need to take up to one month off work after the surgery to ensure proper recovery. Your doctor will advise you on what you need to do or not do. Generally, most people love how they look after this procedure. That can take time, though. You may not feel like your normal self for months after the surgery. Diet and exercise can help you maintain the results.

117,203,"['https://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/guide/prostate-cancer-radiation-therapy\nRadiation therapy, also called X-ray therapy, uses high levels of radiation to kill prostate cancer cells or keep them from growing and dividing, while minimizing damage to healthy cells. Radiation can be produced from a machine outside the body (external radiation) and directed right at the prostate or by putting materials that produce radiation (radioisotopes) through thin plastic tubes into the cancer-infected area (internal radiation or brachytherapy). Internal radiation therapy places radioactive implants directly into the tumor. These radioactive sources can be temporary (removed after the proper dose is reached) or permanent. See Radioactive Seed Implants for more about this type of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. External radiation therapy requires regular sessions (generally five days per weeks) during a period of about five to eight weeks. For each treatment, the radiation therapist will help you onto the treatment table and into the correct position. Once the therapist is sure you are positioned well, he or she will leave the room and start the radiation treatment. You will be under constant observation during the treatment. Cameras and an intercom are in the treatment room, so the therapist can always see and hear you. Be sure to remain still and relaxed during treatment. Let the therapist know if you have any problems or discomfort. The therapist will be in and out of the room to reposition the machine and change your position. The treatment machine will not touch you, and you will feel nothing during the treatment. Once the treatment is complete, the therapist will help you off the treatment table. The radiation therapist will take a port film, also known as an X-ray, on the first day of treatment and about every week thereafter. Port films verify that you are being positioned accurately during your treatments. Port films do not provide diagnostic information, so radiation therapists cannot learn about your progress from these films. However, port films are important to help the therapists make sure the radiation is delivered to the precise area that needs treatment. Small marks resembling freckles will be made on your skin along the treatment area by the radiation therapist. These marks provide targets for the treatment and are a semi-permanent outline of your treatment area. Do not try to wash these marks off or retouch them if they fade. The therapist will re-mark the treatment area when necessary. Yes. Good nutrition is an important part of recovering from the side effects of radiation therapy. When you are eating well, you have the energy to do the activities you want to do, and your body is able to heal and fight infection. Most important, good nutrition can give you a sense of well-being. Since eating when you don\'t feel well can be difficult, consider working with a dietitian. He or she can help make sure that you are getting adequate nutrition during your radiation therapy. During your treatment, radiation must pass through your skin. You may notice some skin changes in the area exposed to radiation. Your skin may become \x1b[92m[1] red, swollen, warm, and sensitive, as if you have a sunburn\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] It may peel or become moist and tender\x1b[0m. Depending on the dose of radiation you receive, you may notice a loss of hair or decreased perspiration within the treated area. These skin reactions are common and temporary. They will subside gradually within four to six weeks of completing treatment. If skin changes appear outside the treated area, inform your doctor or primary nurse. Long-term side effects, which can last up to a year or longer after treatment, may include a slight darkening of the skin, enlarged pores, increased or decreased sensitivity of the skin, and a thickening of tissue or skin. Another possible side effect is erectile dysfunction and urinary symptoms such as frequency, bleeding, or, rarely, incontinence. Keep these side effects in mind when considering your treatment options. If you have any concerns, don\'t hesitate to talk to your doctor about them. \x1b[92m[3] Gently cleanse the treated area using lukewarm water and a mild soap such as Ivory, Dove, Neutrogena, Basis, Castile, or Aveeno Oatmeal Soap\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Do not rub\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Pat your skin dry with a soft towel or use a hair dryer on a cool setting\x1b[0m. Try not to scratch or rub the treated area. \x1b[92m[6] Do not apply any ointment, cream, lotion, or powder to the treated area unless your radiation oncologist or nurse has prescribed it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Do not wear tight-fitting clothing or clothes made from harsh fabrics such as wool or corduroy\x1b[0m. These fabrics can irritate the skin. Instead, choose clothes made from natural fibers such as cotton. Do not apply medical tape or bandages to the treated area. Do not expose the treated area to extreme heat or cold. Avoid using an electric heating pad, hot water bottle, or ice pack. Do not expose the treated area to direct sunlight, as sun exposure may intensify your skin reaction and lead to severe sunburn. Choose a sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher. Protect the treated area from direct sunlight even after your course of treatment is over. Everyone has his or her own energy level, so radiation treatment will affect each person differently. Patients often feel fatigue after several weeks of treatment. For most patients, this fatigue is mild. However, a loss of energy may require some patients to change their daily routine. If your doctor thinks you should limit your activity, he or she will discuss it with you. To minimize fatigue while you are receiving radiation treatment: Be sure to get enough rest. Eat well-balanced, nutritious meals. Pace your activities and plan frequent rest periods. 3- D conformal radiation therapy uses CT-based treatment ( CT is short for computed tomography, which uses X-rays to produce detailed pictures inside the body) combined with three-dimensional images of a prostate tumor. Radiation is aimed at the prostate gland from numerous directions, thus minimizing the damage to normal tissue. This technique allows for precise delivery of radiation doses. So far, it has worked well for localized tumors, such as prostate cancer limited to the prostate gland. All patients have a CT scan specifically for radiation therapy treatment and planning. The CT data is electronically transferred to the 3-dimensional treatment planning computer. The doctor defines the area to be treated along with surrounding areas, such as the bladder, rectum, bowel, and bones. An optimal radiation beam and dose are analyzed using a 3-dimensional computer-generated model. When the exact dose of radiation to the prostate is determined, the patient returns for a treatment simulation. The simulation process transposes or maps the computer-generated plan to the patient. The doctor will review the treatment course and side effects with the patient. Hair loss may occur in the area being radiated. Nausea and vomiting are uncommon unless the upper abdominal areas are radiated. Mild fatigue. Patients continue their normal routine during their treatment, including working full time. Frequent urination, a weak urine stream, or a mild burning with urination. Diarrhea, though uncontrolled diarrhea is rare. Because the radiation beam passes through normal tissues, such as the rectum, bladder, and intestines on its way to the prostate, it kills some healthy cells. This is why diarrhea may result. Possible long-term problems, including proctitis (inflammation of the rectum) with bleeding, bowel problems such as diarrhea, incontinence, and impotence. Intensity- Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT) is an advanced approach to 3- D conformal radiation therapy. The IMRT technique is very precise. IMRT uses computer-generated images to plan and then deliver tightly focused radiation beams to prostate cancer tumors. With this capability, clinicians can vary the beam intensity to ""paint"" a precise radiation dose to the shape and depth of the tumor, while significantly reducing the harmful effects of doses on healthy tissue. Clinical studies indicate that higher dose rates delivered with IMRT techniques improve the rate of local tumor control. Other techniques that are being used or studied include: Image-guided Radiation Therapy ( IGRT) uses radiation machines with built-in scanners that allow for minor adjustments beforeradiation is given. Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy ( VMAT) delivers radiation quickly while it rotates around the body. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT) uses advanced image-guided ways to deliver a large dose of radiation to a very specific place in the prostate. The entire treatment is usually done in just a few days. Proton beam radiation therapy treats tumors with protons instead of X-ray radiation. This therapy may be able to deliver more radiation specifically to a prostate cancer tumor with less damage to normal tissue. Proton therapy is only available in certain centers in the U. S. Who Can I Contact If I Have Personal Concerns About My Treatment? Many hospitals and clinics have a staff social worker who can help you during your treatment. Check with your doctor to see if this is available to you. The social worker can discuss any emotional issues or other concerns about your treatment or your personal situation and provide information about resources. The social worker can also discuss housing or transportation needs if necessary. People dealing with certain medical issues find it helpful to share experiences with others in the same situation. Your doctor can provide a list of support groups if you are interested. Your social worker can provide additional information, and you can look online for support group resources. What About Follow- Up Care? After your radiation therapy sessions are complete, you will visit your doctor for periodic follow-up exams and tests. Your doctor will tell you how often to schedule your follow-up appointments. You may be eligible to receive a Survivorship Care Plan outlining both what treatment you were given, what side effects may be expected in the short and long term, and who should be following you for what testing and care.

Radiation can be produced from a machine outside the body (external radiation) and directed right at the prostate or by putting materials that produce radiation (radioisotopes) through thin plastic tubes into the cancer-infected area (internal radiation or brachytherapy). Internal radiation therapy places radioactive implants directly into the tumor. These radioactive sources can be temporary (removed after the proper dose is reached) or permanent. See Radioactive Seed Implants for more about this type of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. External radiation therapy requires regular sessions (generally five days per weeks) during a period of about five to eight weeks. For each treatment, the radiation therapist will help you onto the treatment table and into the correct position. Once the therapist is sure you are positioned well, he or she will leave the room and start the radiation treatment. You will be under constant observation during the treatment. Cameras and an intercom are in the treatment room, so the therapist can always see and hear you. Be sure to remain still and relaxed during treatment. Let the therapist know if you have any problems or discomfort. The therapist will be in and out of the room to reposition the machine and change your position. The treatment machine will not touch you, and you will feel nothing during the treatment. Once the treatment is complete, the therapist will help you off the treatment table. The radiation therapist will take a port film, also known as an X-ray, on the first day of treatment and about every week thereafter. Port films verify that you are being positioned accurately during your treatments. Port films do not provide diagnostic information, so radiation therapists cannot learn about your progress from these films. However, port films are important to help the therapists make sure the radiation is delivered to the precise area that needs treatment. Small marks resembling freckles will be made on your skin along the treatment area by the radiation therapist. These marks provide targets for the treatment and are a semi-permanent outline of your treatment area. Do not try to wash these marks off or retouch them if they fade. The therapist will re-mark the treatment area when necessary. Yes. Good nutrition is an important part of recovering from the side effects of radiation therapy. When you are eating well, you have the energy to do the activities you want to do, and your body is able to heal and fight infection. Most important, good nutrition can give you a sense of well-being. Since eating when you don\'t feel well can be difficult, consider working with a dietitian. He or she can help make sure that you are getting adequate nutrition during your radiation therapy. During your treatment, radiation must pass through your skin. You may notice some skin changes in the area exposed to radiation. Your skin may become red, swollen, warm, and sensitive, as if you have a sunburn. It may peel or become moist and tender. Depending on the dose of radiation you receive, you may notice a loss of hair or decreased perspiration within the treated area. These skin reactions are common and temporary. They will subside gradually within four to six weeks of completing treatment. If skin changes appear outside the treated area, inform your doctor or primary nurse. Long-term side effects, which can last up to a year or longer after treatment, may include a slight darkening of the skin, enlarged pores, increased or decreased sensitivity of the skin, and a thickening of tissue or skin. Another possible side effect is erectile dysfunction and urinary symptoms such as frequency, bleeding, or, rarely, incontinence. Keep these side effects in mind when considering your treatment options. If you have any concerns, don\'t hesitate to talk to your doctor about them. Gently cleanse the treated area using lukewarm water and a mild soap such as Ivory, Dove, Neutrogena, Basis, Castile, or Aveeno Oatmeal Soap. Do not rub. Pat your skin dry with a soft towel or use a hair dryer on a cool setting. Try not to scratch or rub the treated area. Do not apply any ointment, cream, lotion, or powder to the treated area unless your radiation oncologist or nurse has prescribed it. Do not wear tight-fitting clothing or clothes made from harsh fabrics such as wool or corduroy. These fabrics can irritate the skin. Instead, choose clothes made from natural fibers such as cotton. Do not apply medical tape or bandages to the treated area. Do not expose the treated area to extreme heat or cold. Avoid using an electric heating pad, hot water bottle, or ice pack. Do not expose the treated area to direct sunlight, as sun exposure may intensify your skin reaction and lead to severe sunburn. Choose a sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher. Protect the treated area from direct sunlight even after your course of treatment is over. Everyone has his or her own energy level, so radiation treatment will affect each person differently. Patients often feel fatigue after several weeks of treatment. For most patients, this fatigue is mild. However, a loss of energy may require some patients to change their daily routine. If your doctor thinks you should limit your activity, he or she will discuss it with you. To minimize fatigue while you are receiving radiation treatment: Be sure to get enough rest. Eat well-balanced, nutritious meals.

118,109,"['https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/guide/combating-fatigue-breast-cancer\nYou\'re likely to have some fatigue while you\'re getting treated for breast cancer. That\'s one of the most common side effects of the disease and treatments for it. Fatigue isn\'t the same as being tired. Tiredness happens to everyone, and a good night\'s sleep usually re-energizes you. Fatigue is a daily lack of energy or whole-body tiredness that doesn\'t go away, even with good sleep. It can keep you from doing normal, daily things, and it affects your quality of life. Sometimes it\'s ""acute,"" meaning it lasts a month or less. In other cases it\'s ""chronic"" and lasts up to 6 months or longer. Usually, it comes on suddenly, and may continue after you\'re done with your treatment. Here are some possible reasons for it, along with tips to help you get some of your energy back. \x1b[92m[1] The disease itself\x1b[0m can be the problem. Tumor cells steal calories and nutrients from normal cells, and that leads to tiredness that won\'t seem to let up. Treatments can cause fatigue, too: \x1b[92m[2] Chemotherapy\x1b[0m . Any chemo drug can cause you to have fatigue. It lasts for a few days in some people, while others say they have it throughout treatment or even afterward. \x1b[92m[3] Radiation\x1b[0m can give you fatigue that tends to get worse over time. It usually lasts 3 to 4 weeks after your treatment stops, but it can continue for up to 3 months. \x1b[92m[4] Hormone therapy\x1b[0m deprives the body of estrogen, and that can lead to fatigue that may last throughout your treatment or longer. \x1b[92m[5] Bone marrow transplant\x1b[0m . This aggressive form of treatment can give you a daily lack of energy that lasts up to 1 year. \x1b[92m[6] Targeted therapy\x1b[0m. High amounts of these medications can lead to long-lasting fatigue. \x1b[92m[7] Combination therapy\x1b[0m. Getting more than one cancer treatment at the same time or one after the other also increases your chances of feeling listless. \x1b[92m[8] Surgery\x1b[0m. Everyone recovers from surgery at different rates. This can also cause some daily exhaustion. \x1b[92m[9] Cancer treatments can cause anemia\x1b[0m, a blood disorder where your body\'s cells don\'t get the oxygen they need. And side effects of treatments -- such as nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, taste changes, heartburn, or diarrhea -- can lower the amount of nutrition you get, which can make you feel worn-out. \x1b[92m[10] Medicines used to treat side effects\x1b[0m like nausea, pain, depression, anxiety, and seizures can cause fatigue, too. So can hormonal changes related to medications. If your thyroid gland is underactive, your metabolism may slow down so much that your body doesn\'t burn food fast enough to give you energy. This is a common condition, but it can also happen after radiation therapy to the lymph nodes in the neck. In older people, being less active and having problems moving around can lead to fatigue. Younger people in treatment sometimes overexert themselves and bring on daily lack of energy or whole-body tiredness. Chronic, severe pain makes it worse. Stress doesn\'t help, either. Fatigue often happens when people try to keep their normal daily routines and activities during treatment. Changing your activities can help you save energy. Depression and fatigue often go hand in hand, but it may not be clear which started first. One way to sort this out is to try to understand your depressed feelings and how they affect your life. Let your doctor know if you feel depressed all the time, were depressed before your cancer diagnosis, or are preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness. The first step is to try to figure out the source or sources of your fatigue. There may be more than one reason you\'re feeling this way. Your doctor can do tests to check for anemia or hypothyroidism. If you have one of these conditions, treatments can help. If you think your cancer treatment is the cause, you can talk to your doctor about ways to help you manage it, or discuss other options. Figure out your level of energy. Keep a diary for 1 week. Write down the times of day when you\'re most fatigued, and the times when you have the most energy. Note what you think might be the reasons why. Know the warning signs of fatigue: Tired eyes Tired legs Whole-body tiredness Stiff shoulders Trouble concentrating Weakness or malaise Boredom or lack of motivation Exhaustion, even after sleeping Irritability Nervousness, anxiety, or impatience 1. \x1b[92m[11] Plan ahead, and organize your work\x1b[0m. Combine activities and simplify details. Ask family members or friends to help you with tasks when possible. 2. \x1b[92m[12] Pace yourself\x1b[0m. A moderate pace is better than rushing through your day. 3. \x1b[92m[13] Balance periods of rest and work\x1b[0m. Use your energy only on important tasks. Schedule rest before you become fatigued -- frequent, short breaks are helpful. 4. \x1b[92m[14] Alternate sitting and standing\x1b[0m. When you sit, use a chair with good back support. Sit up with your back straight and your shoulders back. 5. \x1b[92m[15] Try to work without bending over\x1b[0m. Adjust the level of your work instead. When you have to lift something, bend your knees and use your leg muscles to lift, not your back. 6. Limit work that requires reaching over your head or that adds to muscle tension. Change where you store items to reduce trips or reaching. Rather than moving a large load, break it into smaller ones, or use a cart. 7. Breathe evenly, and wear comfortable clothes to allow for free and easy breathing. 8. Avoid too-hot or too-cold temperatures. Don\'t take long, hot showers or baths. Cancer-related fatigue can get worse if you\'re not eating enough or if you\'re not eating the right foods. \x1b[92m[16] A balanced diet can help you feel better and have more energy\x1b[0m. Here are some ways to improve your diet: Get enough calories. If you have cancer, you need about 15 calories per pound of weight if your weight has been stable. Add 500 calories per day if you\'ve lost weight. For example, a person who weighs 150 pounds needs about 2,250 calories per day to maintain his or her weight. Get plenty of protein. It rebuilds and repairs damaged cells. Women need about 46 grams per day, and men need 56 grams. Good sources of protein include dairy foods, meat, eggs, and beans. Drink plenty of fluids. That will help you avoid fatigue that comes from dehydration. And it\'ll help you get calories. Drink things like water, juice, milk, broth, and milkshakes. Avoid drinks with caffeine. Also, you\'ll need more fluids if you have vomiting or diarrhea. Get enough vitamins. Ask your doctor whether you should take a vitamin supplement if you\'re not sure you\'re getting enough nutrients. A multivitamin provides many of the nutrients your body needs. But vitamin supplements don\'t have calories, so make sure you eat nutritious foods to get your calories. Consider seeing a registered dietitian. They can help you with any eating problems that may be keeping you from getting proper nutrition (such as problems swallowing, changes in tastes, or feeling full quickly). A dietitian can also suggest ways to get more calories and protein in smaller amounts of food. Your cancer and treatments may make you feel drained, leaving you lying in bed or sitting in chairs for hours. But that sort of inactivity can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, weakness, and further fatigue. \x1b[92m[17] Regular, moderate exercise can ease those feelings, help you stay active, and give you more energy\x1b[0m. Even during your cancer treatment, you may be able to keep exercising. Here are some tips: Check with your doctor before you begin an exercise program. Start slowly if you get the OK. Give your body time to adjust. Keep a regular exercise schedule. Try to be active at least 150 minutes a week. If you\'re just starting, build up to this amount over time. The right kind of exercise never makes you feel sore, stiff, or exhausted. If you that happens or you feel out of breath, you\'re overdoing it. Swimming, brisk walking, stationary cycling, and low-impact aerobics (taught by a certified instructor) might be good choices. But talk to your doctor if you have any questions about exercises that are safe for you. Managing stress can play an important role in fighting fatigue. Here are some suggestions that may help. Adjust your expectations. For example, if you have a list of 10 things you want to accomplish today, pare it down to two and leave the rest for other days. A sense of accomplishment goes a long way toward easing stress. Help others understand and support you. Family and friends can be helpful if they can put themselves in your shoes and understand what fatigue means to you. Cancer support groups can be a source of strength, too. Other people with the disease may understand what you\'re going through. \x1b[92m[19] Relaxation techniques like deep breathing or visualization\x1b[0m can lower stress, too. Or just do low-key things that are fun for you -- read, listen to music, or knit, for example. Let your doctor know if your stress seems out of control. He can help you feel better. Although cancer-related fatigue is a common side effect of cancer and its treatments, you should mention any of your concerns to your doctor. There are times when fatigue may be a clue to an underlying medical problem. Other times, there may be things your doctor can do to help control fatigue.

That\'s one of the most common side effects of the disease and treatments for it. Fatigue isn\'t the same as being tired. Tiredness happens to everyone, and a good night\'s sleep usually re-energizes you. Fatigue is a daily lack of energy or whole-body tiredness that doesn\'t go away, even with good sleep. It can keep you from doing normal, daily things, and it affects your quality of life. Sometimes it\'s ""acute,"" meaning it lasts a month or less. In other cases it\'s ""chronic"" and lasts up to 6 months or longer. Usually, it comes on suddenly, and may continue after you\'re done with your treatment. Here are some possible reasons for it, along with tips to help you get some of your energy back. The disease itself can be the problem. Tumor cells steal calories and nutrients from normal cells, and that leads to tiredness that won\'t seem to let up. Treatments can cause fatigue, too: Chemotherapy . Any chemo drug can cause you to have fatigue. It lasts for a few days in some people, while others say they have it throughout treatment or even afterward. Radiation can give you fatigue that tends to get worse over time. It usually lasts 3 to 4 weeks after your treatment stops, but it can continue for up to 3 months. Hormone therapy deprives the body of estrogen, and that can lead to fatigue that may last throughout your treatment or longer. Bone marrow transplant . This aggressive form of treatment can give you a daily lack of energy that lasts up to 1 year. Targeted therapy. High amounts of these medications can lead to long-lasting fatigue. Combination therapy. Getting more than one cancer treatment at the same time or one after the other also increases your chances of feeling listless. Surgery. Everyone recovers from surgery at different rates. This can also cause some daily exhaustion. Cancer treatments can cause anemia, a blood disorder where your body\'s cells don\'t get the oxygen they need. And side effects of treatments -- such as nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, taste changes, heartburn, or diarrhea -- can lower the amount of nutrition you get, which can make you feel worn-out. Medicines used to treat side effects like nausea, pain, depression, anxiety, and seizures can cause fatigue, too. So can hormonal changes related to medications. If your thyroid gland is underactive, your metabolism may slow down so much that your body doesn\'t burn food fast enough to give you energy. This is a common condition, but it can also happen after radiation therapy to the lymph nodes in the neck. In older people, being less active and having problems moving around can lead to fatigue. Younger people in treatment sometimes overexert themselves and bring on daily lack of energy or whole-body tiredness. Chronic, severe pain makes it worse. Stress doesn\'t help, either. Fatigue often happens when people try to keep their normal daily routines and activities during treatment. Changing your activities can help you save energy. Depression and fatigue often go hand in hand, but it may not be clear which started first. One way to sort this out is to try to understand your depressed feelings and how they affect your life. Let your doctor know if you feel depressed all the time, were depressed before your cancer diagnosis, or are preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness. The first step is to try to figure out the source or sources of your fatigue. There may be more than one reason you\'re feeling this way. Your doctor can do tests to check for anemia or hypothyroidism. If you have one of these conditions, treatments can help. If you think your cancer treatment is the cause, you can talk to your doctor about ways to help you manage it, or discuss other options. Figure out your level of energy. Keep a diary for 1 week. Write down the times of day when you\'re most fatigued, and the times when you have the most energy. Note what you think might be the reasons why. Know the warning signs of fatigue: Tired eyes Tired legs Whole-body tiredness Stiff shoulders Trouble concentrating Weakness or malaise Boredom or lack of motivation Exhaustion, even after sleeping Irritability Nervousness, anxiety, or impatience 1. Plan ahead, and organize your work. Combine activities and simplify details. Ask family members or friends to help you with tasks when possible. 2. Pace yourself. A moderate pace is better than rushing through your day. 3. Balance periods of rest and work. Use your energy only on important tasks. Schedule rest before you become fatigued -- frequent, short breaks are helpful. 4. Alternate sitting and standing. When you sit, use a chair with good back support. Sit up with your back straight and your shoulders back. 5. Try to work without bending over. Adjust the level of your work instead. When you have to lift something, bend your knees and use your leg muscles to lift, not your back. 6. Limit work that requires reaching over your head or that adds to muscle tension. Change where you store items to reduce trips or reaching. Rather than moving a large load, break it into smaller ones, or use a cart. 7. Breathe evenly, and wear comfortable clothes to allow for free and easy breathing. 8. Avoid too-hot or too-cold temperatures. Don\'t take long, hot showers or baths. Cancer-related fatigue can get worse if you\'re not eating enough or if you\'re not eating the right foods. A balanced diet can help you feel better and have more energy. Here are some ways to improve your diet: Get enough calories. If you have cancer, you need about 15 calories per pound of weight if your weight has been stable. Add 500 calories per day if you\'ve lost weight. For example, a person who weighs 150 pounds needs about 2,250 calories per day to maintain his or her weight. Get plenty of protein. It rebuilds and repairs damaged cells. Women need about 46 grams per day, and men need 56 grams. Good sources of protein include dairy foods, meat, eggs, and beans. Drink plenty of fluids.

119,181,"['https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/making-diagnosis-mri\nAn MRI is a test that makes clear images of the brain without the use of X-rays. Instead, it uses a large magnet, radio waves, and a computer to produce these pictures. The scan \x1b[92m[1] can give doctors information about the structure of the brain and brain chemicals to help them find the cause of your headaches\x1b[0m. Your doctor might recommend one \x1b[92m[2] if you\'re getting headaches daily or almost every day\x1b[0m. You might also get one \x1b[92m[3] if you had a CT scan that didn\'t show clear-cut results\x1b[0m. MRI scans also \x1b[92m[4] can look at parts of the brain that aren\'t as easily viewed with CT scans\x1b[0m, such as the spine at the level of the neck and the back portion of the brain. An MRI \x1b[92m[5] can\'t diagnose migraines, cluster, or tension headaches\x1b[0m, but it \x1b[92m[6] can help doctors rule out other medical conditions that may cause your symptoms\x1b[0m, such as: \x1b[92m[7] A brain tumor\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[8] An infection in your brain, called an abscess\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[9] The buildup of fluid in the brain, called hydrocephalus\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[10] Spinal cord problems, such as a herniated disc\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[11] Strokes\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[12] Injuries\x1b[0m Yes. The MRI exam poses no risk to the average person. The scan is also safe for people who\'ve had heart surgery and people who have these medical devices: Surgical clips or sutures Artificial joints Staples Cardiac valve replacements (except the Starr- Edwards metallic ball/cage) Disconnected medication pumps Vena cava filters Brain shunt tubes for hydrocephalus Some things may mean you shouldn\'t have an MRI. Tell your doctor if you: Have a heart pacemaker A cerebral aneurysm clip (metal clip on a blood vessel in your brain) Are pregnant Have an implanted insulin pump (for treatment of diabetes), narcotics pump (for pain medication), or implanted nerve stimulators "" TENS"" device for back pain Metal in your eye or eye socket Cochlear (ear) implant for hearing problems Implanted spine stabilization rods Severe lung disease (such as tracheomalacia or bronchopulmonary dysplasia) Gastroesophageal reflux ( GERD) Weigh more than 300 pounds Have trouble lying on your back for 30 to 60 minutes Claustrophobia (fear of closed or narrow spaces) Set aside about 2 hours for the test. In most cases, it takes 40 to 80 minutes, during which technicians will get several dozen images of your brain. Leave personal items such as a watch, wallet, including any credit cards with magnetic strips (they will be erased by the magnet), and jewelry at home if possible, or take them off before the scan. Sometimes, you\'ll get a drug to make you feel relaxed and drowsy. You may also need to change into a hospital gown. Also, MRI machines can be loud, so if you\'re sensitive to noise, ask for earplugs before the scan starts. As it begins, you\'ll hear the equipment making a muffled thumping sound that will last for several minutes. Other than the sound, you shouldn\'t feel anything unusual during the scanning. For some MRI exams, you\'ll need a shot of a ""contrast material"" into your vein. It helps doctors see certain structures in your brain on the scan images. Feel free to ask questions.

Imagine doing that all day and you‚Äôll have a better idea of the weight and stress your dog puts on his muscles and joints. It takes lots of energy, strength, and flexibility to chase squirrels, scratch behind ears, wrestle with playmates, jump on beds, and leap for toys. Every now and then dogs overdo it, asking just too much of their front legs (shoulders, elbows, wrists, and toes) or back legs (hips, knees, ankles, and toes). Sprains and strains are common injuries. If you hear your dog yelp, he may need your help. The words sound alike, but they mean different things. Strains injure tendons that link muscles and bones. This can happen if your dog stretches too far, too much, or too often. Athletic dogs get strains, but this injury also can happen when a dog slips, falls, or jumps during normal play. In dogs, strains are common in the hips and thighs. Sprains harm the ligaments that connect bones, which causes joint damage. Sprains can happen to hunting dogs who jump hurdles, as well as to the average dog who may hurt himself taking a hard landing off the couch, or even by something as simple as stepping in a hole. The wrist and knee are common joints for dogs to sprain. One of the most serious injuries is a torn cranial cruciate ligament ( CCL), which connects the bones of the knee. The first warning sign of strains or sprains may be that \x1b[92m[1] your dog starts to limp or is suddenly lame, meaning he can‚Äôt use his leg\x1b[0m. If this lasts more than a day or so, or if it happens again and again, it‚Äôs time for a visit to the vet. Both strains and sprains can be chronic (ongoing) or acute (sudden), and can range from mild to severe. Your vet will figure out what kind of injury your dog has based on what you tell her and the results of a physical exam and tests. She‚Äôll want to know when you first noticed a change. You should explain: How your dog is acting differently. What he was doing if you saw the injury happen. What he is or isn‚Äôt doing since the injury. Is he sleeping more? Limping? Sitting with his leg extended? Not excited about going for a walk? Stiff? Not eating? These are signs he doesn‚Äôt feel well. The vet will check your dog‚Äôs muscles and joints. She‚Äôll look him over first, then touch and press on certain points to see if they‚Äôre sore, warm, swollen, or out of place. She‚Äôll want to see him walk, sit, and lie down. She may take X-rays or do an MRI or ultrasound to get a look at damage that can‚Äôt be seen from the outside. X-rays show problems with bones. The other kinds of images are better for seeing tissue damage. It takes the same kinds of things to get your dog back on four feet as it would take to get you back on two. Your vet will decide how to treat your dog based on whether he has a strain or a sprain, and just how bad it is. She‚Äôll likely try to avoid surgery as a first line of treatment unless a tendon or ligament is torn. In a typical plan to treat strains and sprains, \x1b[92m[2] your vet may tell you to: Give your dog nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) to ease inflammatio\x1b[0mn. Make sure to ask what is safe to give him. Some over the counter NSAIDs for people can cause serious illness and even death for a dog. \x1b[92m[3] Apply an ice pack or heating pad\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Make sure your dog rests\x1b[0m. Don't let him jump or run. Sometimes you may need to crate him. \x1b[92m[5] Walk your dog on a leash, taking it slowly at first\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Use a brace or support to hold your dog‚Äôs muscle or joint in place\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Try physical therapy\x1b[0m, such as walk on an underwater or land treadmill, balancing on a ball or board. \x1b[92m[8] Massage the area\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] Put your dog on a diet\x1b[0m. Surgery is in order for otherwise-healthy dogs that don‚Äôt get better, keep injuring themselves, or have a torn tendon or ligament. If your vet didn‚Äôt do an MRI or ultrasound the first time around, she may want to see these images before doing surgery. Depending on the type of surgery, you‚Äôll need to keep your dog quiet and limit his activity for a week or longer. The vet may use a bandage or brace to support the joint. If your dog moves too much or too soon after surgery, he could re-injure himself. Physical therapy can help him get back to being active at the right pace. Whether your dog has injured himself before or you just want to keep him from getting a strain or sprain, make sure he stays at a healthy weight and gets regular exercise. Obesity and inactivity make these injuries more likely.""]",How do you treat a dog's sprain or  strain?,"Signs of a sprain or strain in dogs include [92m""your dog starts to limp or is suddenly lame, meaning he can‚Äôt use his leg"" [1][0m.

121,196,"['https://www.webmd.com/palliative-care/siblings-of-children-with-serious-illnesses\nWhen a child is seriously ill, the focus of the whole family shifts. During long hospital stays or intense treatments, as parents spend a great deal of time outside of the home, brothers and sisters of a sick child can sometimes feel forgotten. Palliative care teams, also known as pediatric advanced care ( PAC) teams, partner with families to address the range of typical emotions that siblings of a seriously ill child may experience. A sick child\'s sisters and brothers often feel left out or ignored. Here are a few ways parents can make sure their other children feel included, needed, and attended to: \x1b[92m[1] Find ways to let the siblings participate at home and at the hospital\x1b[0m. Give them some way to help out at home, but don\'t ask them to take on a parent-like role. They need \x1b[92m[2] simple, age-appropriate tasks that contribute to the day-to-day functioning of the household, so they know they are needed\x1b[0m. At times when children may not be permitted to visit the hospital, ask siblings \x1b[92m[3] to draw pictures or make cards to put in the sick child\'s room\x1b[0m. Ask them to \x1b[92m[4] collect some of the sick child\'s personal items, such as books or stuffed animals, to be sent to the hospital\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Answer the siblings\' questions\x1b[0m. Provide \x1b[92m[6] age-appropriate answers that are truthful, concrete, and thorough\x1b[0m (but you don\'t need to provide more information than the child is asking for). No matter how hard parents try to protect their children from the reality of the situation, children frequently know when something is going on, and they will certainly have questions. Parents with the best intentions often evade their children\'s questions -- which adds to the children feeling excluded. \x1b[92m[7] Acknowledge sibling relationships\x1b[0m. When a family is grieving the illness or the loss of a child, it may seem to siblings that the focus is on the parents\' relationship with the child. The brothers and sisters have a vital relationship with their sick sibling, too, and that relationship should be acknowledged. If a family is mourning the loss of a child, specialists recommend that siblings, not only parents, keep memorabilia from the child, such as a lock of hair, a favorite doll, or photographs. Feeling excluded can naturally lead to jealousy. Siblings may even wish a sick sibling would die. Then, if their sibling\'s condition does not improve, or worsens, the well siblings feel guilty or perhaps responsible. Children ages 3 to 6 years are particularly susceptible. They are what experts call ""magical thinkers,"" who believe their thoughts have the power to hurt others. A magical thinker who feels jealous of a sibling or wishes for a sibling\'s death can feel responsible if his sibling\'s condition does not improve. The sibling\'s condition may even appear to be punishment for something the magical thinker did. Children at this age are capable of thinking, "" Yesterday I stole my brother\'s toy, and today my brother is even sicker. It\'s my fault."" Parents can combat the feelings that lead to jealousy and guilt by making sure children feel \x1b[92m[8] included and loved\x1b[0m and by assuring children that \x1b[92m[9] their feelings are normal\x1b[0m. Parents should make clear to children of all ages, and magical thinkers in particular, that they had nothing to do with their sibling\'s illness. Most children just want things to go back to normal. Parents should make every effort to keep siblings on their regular schedules for school, mealtimes, bedtimes, and extra-curricular activities. Parents will need to rely on trusted family members and friends to ensure that this happens. Palliative care social workers note that sometimes families want to keep their child\'s condition to themselves and not ask for help. This is nearly impossible -- and could be detrimental to the well-being of the other children. When children must be taken out of their normal comfort zones -- for hospital visits or perhaps for serious talks about the circumstances -- they should be permitted to leave the situation at any time. For example, if children would like to visit their sibling in the hospital, they should be accompanied by an adult who can take them out of the room as soon as they are ready. Child life specialists can serve this function, or the child can come to the hospital accompanied by a relative or family friend. Children who attend the memorial service of a child who dies should come with an adult who can take them away from the service at any time they ask to leave. Parents might be hurt when a child wants to leave the bedside or funeral of a sibling, but this is a normal response -- not an indication of indifference on the child\'s part. Children are not capable of absorbing all the implications of a painful situation all at once as adults are. They don\'t have the frame of reference that increased life experience provides. While reality sets in, the children will want to return to what\'s normal for them. Children may show a similar desire to get back to regular activities when parents try to have a serious talk. For example, after a parent explains a sibling\'s diagnosis, the child may ask to go back to playing. This doesn\'t mean the child hasn\'t heard or understood. Experts advise parents to honor the child\'s request and participate in the activity in case questions arise. The range of emotions felt during a sibling\'s illness can lead to distress. Parents should take the following behaviors as an indication that children are distressed, and that their feelings should be addressed. All Ages: Children of any age can regress to past behaviors, such as bed wetting, thumb sucking, or wanting to sleep in their parents\' bed. 6- to 9-year-olds: Nightmares Violent play Aggression Playing the role of the sick or deceased family member Confusion about his own role, i.e. "" Am I the big brother now or am I still the middle brother?"" 9- to 12-year-olds: Problems in school, behavioral and/or academic Aggression Withdrawal from regular activities Extreme weight change and eating disorders Suicidal thoughts Teens: Anger Guilt Weight change and eating disorders Substance abuse Opposition to or defiance of parents; struggling to become more independent from parents while parents may cling more to the child Suicidal thoughts Many hospitals have groups or organized therapeutic activities for siblings of seriously ill children. Caregivers also refer families to community resources, including summer camps and other recreational programs. Pediatric psychiatrists and licensed clinical social workers are trained to help families manage grief and the demands of caring for a chronically ill child Child-life specialists give individualized attention to siblings of sick children. They help identify siblings\' needs, talk to them about difficult topics, and coach parents on how to talk to their kids and answer their questions. Specialists also prepare children to visit a sibling in the hospital, explain procedures and diagnoses using props, and offer expressive outlets through guided art and play activities. With parents\' permission, specialists can work with the children\'s schools. Experts stress the importance of letting school teachers know what\'s happening. Teachers can then look for and understand signs of distress. PAC specialists can coach teachers and counselors on how to address the needs of siblings and other students impacted by the circumstances. They can also can give presentations for the classmates of sick children and their siblings. Chronic or life-limiting conditions bring a host of new responsibilities for parents.

122,170,"['https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/handling-cardiac-emergencies\nSudden cardiac death ( SCD) is a sudden, unexpected death caused by a lethal heart rhythm (sudden cardiac arrest). It is a leading cause of \'\'natural deaths\'\' in the U. S., causing about 295,000 adults to die each year. SCD is responsible for half of all heart disease deaths. SCD occurs most frequently in adults in their mid-30s to mid-40s, and affects men twice as often as it does women. SCD is rare in children, although the exact prevalence is not known. Sudden cardiac arrest can be treated if addressed within the first few minutes. The American Heart Association promotes the following four steps, called ""\x1b[92m[1] the chain of survival:\x1b[0m"" \x1b[92m[2] Early Access to Care\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Quick contact with emergency care is essential\x1b[0m. Call 911 (in most communities) or your local emergency number immediately. \x1b[92m[4] Early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR\x1b[0m). \x1b[92m[5] Learning CPR is the greatest gift you can give your family and friends\x1b[0m. If performed properly (see below), CPR can help save a life until emergency medical help arrives. \x1b[92m[6] Early Defibrillation\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] In most adults, sudden cardiac death is related to ventricular fibrillation\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Quick defibrillation (delivery of an electrical shock) is necessary\x1b[0m to return the heart rhythm to a normal heartbeat. Many public places, such as malls, golf courses, and airports, have automated external defibrillators ( AEDs; see below) available for use in emergency situations. \x1b[92m[9] Early Advanced Care\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] After successful defibrillation, most patients require hospital care to treat and prevent future events\x1b[0m. These four steps \x1b[92m[11] can increase survival as much as 90% if initiated within the first minutes after sudden cardiac arrest\x1b[0m. Survival decreases by about 10% each minute longer. CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is an emergency technique used to help someone whose heart and/or breathing has stopped. When a person\'s heart stops, blood stops circulating throughout the body. If a person stops breathing, the blood can\'t get oxygen. Therefore, it is vital for people in this emergency situation to receive medical treatment, such as CPR, within the first few minutes of the event. By administering a combination of manual chest compressions and artificial, or ""mouth-to-mouth,"" respiration, the rescuer can breathe for the victim and help circulate some of the blood throughout their body. But even without mouth-to-mouth, hands only CPR can be very effective. CPR does not restart a heart that has stopped, but it can keep a victim alive until more aggressive treatment (defibrillation) can be administered. CPR is not difficult to learn, and many organizations offer courses in CPR, including the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, and local community centers, health clubs, and YMCAs. An AED, an automatic external defibrillator, is a device used to administer an electric shock through the chest wall to the heart. The device has built-in computers that assess the victim\'s heart rhythm, judge whether defibrillation is needed, and then administer the shock. Audible and/or visual prompts guide the user through the process. Most AEDs are designed to be used by non-medical people such as fire department personnel, police officers, lifeguards, flight attendants, security guards, teachers, and even family members of high-risk persons. The goal is to provide access defibrillation when needed as quickly as possible. CPR along with AEDs can dramatically increase survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest.

Call 911 (in most communities) or your local emergency number immediately. Early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR). Learning CPR is the greatest gift you can give your family and friends. If performed properly (see below), CPR can help save a life until emergency medical help arrives. Early Defibrillation. In most adults, sudden cardiac death is related to ventricular fibrillation. Quick defibrillation (delivery of an electrical shock) is necessary to return the heart rhythm to a normal heartbeat. Many public places, such as malls, golf courses, and airports, have automated external defibrillators ( AEDs; see below) available for use in emergency situations. Early Advanced Care. After successful defibrillation, most patients require hospital care to treat and prevent future events. These four steps can increase survival as much as 90% if initiated within the first minutes after sudden cardiac arrest. Survival decreases by about 10% each minute longer. CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is an emergency technique used to help someone whose heart and/or breathing has stopped. When a person\'s heart stops, blood stops circulating throughout the body. If a person stops breathing, the blood can\'t get oxygen. Therefore, it is vital for people in this emergency situation to receive medical treatment, such as CPR, within the first few minutes of the event. By administering a combination of manual chest compressions and artificial, or ""mouth-to-mouth,"" respiration, the rescuer can breathe for the victim and help circulate some of the blood throughout their body. But even without mouth-to-mouth, hands only CPR can be very effective. CPR does not restart a heart that has stopped, but it can keep a victim alive until more aggressive treatment (defibrillation) can be administered. CPR is not difficult to learn, and many organizations offer courses in CPR, including the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, and local community centers, health clubs, and YMCAs. An AED, an automatic external defibrillator, is a device used to administer an electric shock through the chest wall to the heart. The device has built-in computers that assess the victim\'s heart rhythm, judge whether defibrillation is needed, and then administer the shock. Audible and/or visual prompts guide the user through the process. Most AEDs are designed to be used by non-medical people such as fire department personnel, police officers, lifeguards, flight attendants, security guards, teachers, and even family members of high-risk persons. The goal is to provide access defibrillation when needed as quickly as possible. CPR along with AEDs can dramatically increase survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest. No, the AED treats only a heart in an abnormal rhythm suitable for defibrillation. If a person is in cardiac arrest without such a rhythm, the heart will not respond to electric currents.

But what does it mean in real life, when you\'re at the grocery store or deciding what to put on your plate? Let\'s take a look at specific foods that can help this painful problem and ways to work them into your meals. And on the flip side, what you may want to stay away from. Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like goo. ( Picture what happens to oats when you mix them with water.) You want this stuff. It makes your stool soft, well-formed, and easy to pass. No constipation, little irritation. Sounds like the Holy Grail of poop, right? Insoluble fiber is what your grandmother would call ""roughage."" It doesn\'t dissolve. ( If you drop a chunk of celery in water, it just sits there.) It helps to keep things moving through -- and out of -- your system and to balance the chemistry in your intestines. Many ""high-fiber"" foods have both kinds. You should aim for 25-30 grams or more of fiber every day from what you eat, about twice what most Americans get. In general, you\'ll want about a third of that to be soluble (more when you have diarrhea). Too much fiber too fast can cause gas and bloating, so add a little bit to your diet at a time if you\'re not used to it. You\'ll also need to drink more fluids to help your body use that fiber: 8-10 large glasses (at least a half-gallon) of water every day. You\'ll get a lot of bang for your bite with the legume family. Just 1/2 cup of beans -- such as kidney, navy, lima, or black beans -- will cover about a third of your daily goal. It will have between 7 and 10 grams of fiber (both soluble and insoluble), depending on which variety you choose. About 20 almonds or pecans have around 3 grams of fiber. A 1/2 cup of edamame does, too, and it only has about half the calories. Instead of using just meat in chili and soups, add or substitute beans. You can also use beans and nuts in salads. Try Indian and Middle Eastern recipes, which often call for beans, lentils, and peas. Swap white breads, pastas, and crackers for versions made with whole-grain flours, buckwheat, stone-ground cornmeal, or rye to boost the amount of insoluble fiber you\'ll get. Cooked oats and barley will give you soluble fiber, too. Instead of a plain white bagel for breakfast, have a packet of instant oatmeal -- with twice the fiber for less than half the calories. Reach for no-butter popcorn when you get the munchies. Sprinkle oat bran or wheat germ on salads and soups. You can\'t go wrong with plant foods. Keep the skins on when they\'re thin, like on apples, pears, plums, and potatoes. That\'s where the insoluble fiber is, as well as compounds called flavonoids that can help control hemorrhoid bleeding. Brightly colored produce -- berries, grapes, tomatoes, and kale and other dark, leafy greens -- are generally rich in flavonoids. And the fresher, the better. Try to keep them whole and not damage the skins or leaves until you\'re ready to eat them. Avoid cooking to the point that their color fades. A serving of fruit is often good for at least 10% of your daily fiber, usually 3 to 4 grams. A cup of leafy greens, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, winter squash, or green peas will get you 4 to 5 grams of fiber. Some veggies and fruits have fiber plus a lot of water. Cucumbers, celery, mild bell peppers, and watermelon are mostly water -- more than 90%. Make a habit of adding another fruit or vegetable to any meal, like berries or bananas in your cereal, apple chunks on your salad, spinach in your omelet, or grated zucchini in your spaghetti sauce. Snack on dried fruits like figs, apricots, and dates. Swap sugary baked desserts for fresh fruit -- raw strawberries rather than strawberry pie. Foods with little fiber can cause or make constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids) worse, so it\'s best to limit how much you eat of them. White bread and bagels Milk, cheese, and other dairy Meat Processed foods such as frozen meals and fast food Watch the amount of salt you eat.

124,127,"[""https://www.webmd.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/medicines-treat-chronic-fatigue-syndrome\nAlthough there's no cure for chronic fatigue syndrome, there are over-the-counter and prescription medications that could ease your symptoms. Also called also called myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME/ CFS), the symptoms vary from one person to the next. While fatigue and muscle pain might be your worst, constantly awakening unrested and memory loss might be the biggest problems for someone else. You and your doctor should try to tackle your toughest symptoms first -- the ones that most interfere with your daily life. Many people with ME/ CFS have some kind of sleep disorder. Getting a good (or at least better) night's sleep could help you feel less tired during the day. First, your doctor will probably make sure you have good sleep habits. These include sticking to a regular bedtime and wake time and keeping your bedroom quiet, dark, and cool. If this doesn't improve your sleep, she might suggest an over-the-counter sleep aid, such as an over-the-counter antihistamine. While these can help you sleep soundly through the night, the downside is that the effects can last more than 8 hours. This means you could feel drowsy throughout the day, which is exactly what you're trying to avoid. But not all sleep aids affect everyone in the same way. Talk to your doctor about which type would be best for you and how to take it. If over-the-counter sleeping pills don't do the trick, your doctor might try you on a prescription sleeping pill. The goal with these drugs is to get your sleep on track at the lowest possible dose in the shortest amount of time. You aren't supposed to take them long term. Some prescription sleep medications help you get to sleep, such as: Eszopiclone ( Lunesta) Ramelteon ( Rozerem) Zolpidem ( Ambien) Others that your doctor may prescribe help you stay asleep. For example: Trazodone ( Desyrel) Antidepressants Benzodiazepines Muscle relaxants All prescription sleep medications cause side effects. But some of them -- daytime sleepiness, dizziness, unsteadiness, and memory lapse -- are also symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. You and your doctor should weigh the pros and cons. The beneficial effects of many of these medicines wear off in a few weeks, so they are not useful for long-term treatment. Some people are prescribed stimulants, like the ones used to treat ADHD. These medicines help ease fatigue and problems with memory and concentration. But they are tricky for chronic fatigue syndrome. They may give you energy and focus, which could cause you to get stuck in a cycle of overdoing it and then √¢\x80\x9ccrashing.√¢\x80\x9d That would make your condition worse. Since people with ME/ CFS are very sensitive to any medicines that affect the brain, some people experience irritation and agitation taking stimulants, in conventional doses. They should be prescribed in low doses, by doctors who frequently prescribe them and know how to handle the side effects. If you and your doctor decide to try a stimulant, there are a lot to choose from. She will help you pick the best one for you. If ME/ CFS gives you muscle and joint pain, your doctor might suggest over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen. If these don't help, your doctor might prescribe stronger pain medications or refer you to a pain specialist.

They tend to live in indoor and outdoor spaces where people don't go most of the time. If you do find yourself in the same place as one, though, it won't want to attack you -- it'll want to get out of your way.

They produce harmful venom that may cause a painful sore at the site of the bite. It may cause even more severe symptoms in some people. If you have a run-in with a brown recluse, it's wise to have a doctor check you out, just in case. A brown recluse might not be brown, but tan. It has a violin-shaped area on the front half of its body, with the neck of the violin pointing toward the spider's abdomen. It may be bigger than other spiders that you're used to seeing. Its body can range in size from a quarter-inch to three-quarters of an inch, and its long legs make it appear even larger. Most spiders have eight eyes, but a brown recluse spider has six. Two are in the front, and there are two more on each side of its head. Brown recluses are found mostly in the Midwest or the South. The spider favors indoor spaces, like attics, garages or dark closets. Outdoors, it hides in out-of-the-way places -- under logs, beneath porches, or within piles of rocks. A bite might not hurt at first or even leave a mark. For some people, it feels like a pinch or a bee sting. Within the first day or two after you've been bitten, you may notice: Pain or redness at the site of the bite A deep sore (ulcer) that forms where you were bitten, with the skin at the center turning purple Fever Chills Nausea Joint pain Feeling weak Seizures or coma (very rare) Your doctor will want to be as certain as he can that you were, in fact, bitten by a spider. It'll help if you can describe what the spider looked like. Some people try to catch the bug to show the doctor. That's fine, as long as you can do it safely. You might just try to take a photo of it. If you suspect your small child was bitten by a brown recluse, see your doctor right away. Their bodies can't ward off the dangerous effects of the spider's venom. For adults, most brown recluse spider bites can be treated at home with good results.

However, a sore throat from a cold often gets better or goes away after the first day or two. Other cold symptoms such as a runny nose and congestion may follow the sore throat. Strep throat, which is an infection due to streptococcus bacteria, is another cause of sore throats and tonsillitis. With strep throat, the sore throat is often more severe and persists. Tonsillitis is a painful inflammation or infection of the tonsils, the tissue masses located at the back of the throat. Sore throats can be caused by viruses or bacteria. The most common causes of sore throats are viruses. Viral sore throats are often accompanied by other cold symptoms that may include a runny nose, cough, red or watery eyes, and sneezing. Other causes of sore throat include smoking, pollution or irritants in the air, allergies, and dry air. In addition to a sore throat, other common cold symptoms include: Runny nose Sneezing Cough Mild headache Mild body aches Fever Although there is no cure for a sore throat caused by a cold virus, there are ways to help you feel more comfortable. Drinking warm liquids, gargling with warm salt water, sucking on ice chips, or taking an over-the-counter medicine may relieve symptoms of pain or fever. When you are sick with a cold, it is also important to get enough rest, eat a healthy diet, and drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter cold medications may relieve cold and sore throat symptoms. However, the benefits of these drugs are minimal. Some cold medications include: Pain relievers, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen and naproxen, to relieve the aches and pains of a cold and sore throat. ( Aspirin should not be given to children because of its link to Reye's syndrome, a disorder that can cause brain damage and death.) Sore throat sprays and lozenges to soothe your throat and numb the throat pain temporarily. ( Lozenges should not be given to young children.) Decongestant nasal sprays to relieve a sore throat caused by postnasal drip -- nasal drainage that runs down your throat. ( Be sure to stop using nasal decongestant sprays after three days, or you may have an increase in congestion when you stop them.) Antibiotics should not be used to treat a cold virus and sore throat. Antibiotics are effective only against bacteria. They will not work on sore throats associated with colds, which are caused by viruses. Strep throat is caused by an infection of streptococcus bacteria. Strep throat spreads by having contact with an infected person's saliva or nasal secretions. Although strep throat is more common in children ages 5 to 15, it also occurs in adults. To diagnose strep throat, your doctor can check a rapid strep test or send a throat swab to the lab for a culture. In some cases, he or she may be able to diagnose strep based on your reported symptoms and other signs, such as white spots in the throat area, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Strep throat can cause more serious illnesses, such as rheumatic fever, a disease that may harm the heart valves. That's why it's important to get proper medical treatment. With proper treatment, strep throat is usually cured within 10 days. Strep throat symptoms are usually more severe than symptoms of a sore throat with a cold and may include the following: Sudden sore throat Loss of appetite Painful swallowing Red tonsils with white spots Fever The symptoms of a cold and strep throat can be very similar. \x1b[92m[1] If you think you have symptoms of strep throat, visit your health care provider\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and do a physical exam, and you may be given a strep test\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] A rapid strep test checks for streptococcus bacteria infection in the throat\x1b[0m. The test is painless and takes very little time. The tip of a cotton swab is used to wipe the back of the throat. The swab is then tested right away. \x1b[92m[4] If the strep test is positive, you have strep throat\x1b[0m. If the strep test is negative, you likely do not have strep throat. However, if there are strong signs of strep throat, your health care provider can do a different throat swab test that is sent to the lab to see if strep bacteria can be grown (cultured) from it. A throat culture takes a couple of days for results. \x1b[92m[5] Strep throat is treated using antibiotics, which kill the bacteria causing the infection\x1b[0m. Antibiotics are often taken as pills or given as a shot. Penicillin and amoxicillin are common antibiotics used to treat strep throat. Other antibiotics are prescribed for people who are allergic to penicillin. \x1b[92m[6] Follow your health care provider's instructions for antibiotic use\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Take all of the medication, even if you feel better\x1b[0m. You should feel better within a day or two. \x1b[92m[8] A person with strep throat should stay home until 24 hours after starting the antibiotic\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] If your strep throat is not getting better, let your health care provider know right away\x1b[0m. Do not stop taking your prescribedmedicine unless your health care provider tells you to. Call your health care provider if these symptoms occur: Fever one or two days after feeling better Nausea or vomiting Earache Headache Neck stiffness Skin rash Cough Swollen glands Painful joints Shortness of breath Dark urine, rash, or chest pain (may occur three to four weeks later) Sometimes, a sore throat is caused by tonsillitis, an inflammation of the tonsils. Tonsillitis can be caused by viruses or bacteria. While the tonsils' job is to help fight infection, the tonsils can also become infected. When they do, the result is tonsillitis and a very painful sore throat. In addition to a sore throat, a cold usually causes nasal symptoms, such as runny nose or congestion. With tonsillitis, your tonsils become swollen and may have telltale white or yellow spots. Other symptoms with tonsillitis include the following: Bad breath Fever Voice changes because of swelling Painful swallowing Swollen lymph glands in neck If the tonsillitis infection is bacterial like strep throat, then antibiotics are given. If the tonsillitis infection is viral, antibiotics will not help. The virus must run its course for the sore throat to resolve. For either type of throat infection, the following treatment measures may help: Getting plenty of rest Drinking lots of fluid Eating smooth, soothing foods like gelatin, ice cream, shakes, frozen desserts, and soup Avoiding crunchy or spicy foods Using a vaporizer Taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen, naproxen, or ibuprofen. Children should not take aspirin. If the tonsillitis infections occur repeatedly, or if the tonsils are interfering with sleep and breathing, the doctor may recommend a tonsillectomy, which is the surgical removal of the tonsils.""]",Do I need to see my doctor if I think I have strep throat?,"[92m""If you think you have symptoms of strep throat, visit your health care provider"" [1][0m. [92m""Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and do a physical exam, and you may be given a strep test"" [2][0m. [92m""A rapid strep test checks for streptococcus bacteria infection in the throat"" [3][0m. [92m""If the strep test is positive, you have strep throat"" [4][0m. [92m""Strep throat is treated using antibiotics, which kill the bacteria causing the infection"" [5][0m. [92m""Follow your health care provider's instructions for antibiotic use"" [6][0m. [92m""Take all of the medication, even if you feel better"" [7][0m. [92m""A person with strep throat should stay home until 24 hours after starting the antibiotic"" [8][0m. [92m""If your strep throat is not getting better, let your health care provider know right away"" [9][0m.","""If you think you have symptoms of strep throat, visit your health care provider.""

Critical milestones for a baby learning to talk happen in the first three years of life, when a baby\'s brain is rapidly developing. During that time, your baby\'s speech development depends on your ""baby talk"" skills as well as your baby\'s. The first ""baby talk"" is nonverbal and happens soon after birth. Your baby grimaces, cries, and squirms to express a range of emotions and physical needs, from fear and hunger to frustration and sensory overload. Good parents learn to \x1b[92m[3] listen\x1b[0m and interpret their baby\'s different cries. Just when your baby will say those magical first words varies greatly from individual baby to individual baby. But if your baby misses any of the following milestones in speech development, talk to your pediatrician or family doctor about your concerns. Baby Talk Milestones Baby talk at 3 months. At 3 months, your baby \x1b[92m[3] listen\x1b[0ms to your voice, \x1b[92m[1] watch\x1b[0mes your face as you talk, and turns toward other voices, sounds, and music that can be heard around the home. Many infants prefer a woman\'s voice over a man\'s. Many also prefer voices and music they heard while they were still in the womb. By the end of three months, babies begin ""cooing"" -- a happy, gentle, repetitive, sing-song vocalization. Baby talk at 6 months. At 6 months, your baby begins babbling with different sounds. For example, your baby may say ""ba-ba"" or ""da-da."" By the end of the sixth or seventh month, babies respond to their own names, recognize their native language, and use their tone of voice to tell you they\'re happy or upset. Some eager parents interpret a string of ""da-da"" babbles as their baby\'s first words -- ""daddy!"" But babbling at this age is usually still made up of random syllables without real meaning or comprehension. Baby talk at 9 months. After 9 months, babies can understand a few basic words like ""no"" and ""bye-bye."" They also may begin to use a wider range of consonant sounds and tones of voice. Baby talk at 12-18 months. Most babies say a few simple words like ""mama"" and ""dadda"" by the end of 12 months -- and now know what they\'re saying. They respond to -- or at least understand, if not obey -- your short, one-step requests such as, "" Please put that down."" Baby talk at 18 months. Babies at this age say several simple words and can point to people, objects, and body parts you name for them. They repeat words or sounds they hear you say, like the last word in a sentence. But they often leave off endings or beginnings of words. For example, they may say ""daw"" for ""dog"" or ""noo-noo\'s"" for ""noodles."" Baby talk at 2 years. By age 2, babies string together a few words in short phrases of two to four words, such as "" Mommy bye-bye"" or ""me milk."" They\'re learning that words mean more than objects like ""cup"" -- they also mean abstract ideas like ""mine."" Baby talk at 3 years. By the time your baby is age 3, his or her vocabulary expands rapidly, and ""make-believe"" play spurs an understanding of symbolic and abstract language like ""now,"" feelings like ""sad,"" and spatial concepts like ""in."" Babies understand what you\'re saying long before they can clearly speak. Many babies learning to talk use only one or two words at first, even when they understand 25 or more. You can help your baby learn to talk if you: Watch. \x1b[92m[2] Your baby may reach both arms up to say she wants to be picked up, hand you a toy to say she wants to play, or push food off her plate to say she\'s had enough\x1b[0m. Smile, make eye contact, and respond to encourage these early, nonverbal attempts at baby talk. Listen. \x1b[92m[4] Pay attention to your baby\'s cooing and babbling, and coo and babble those same sounds right back to your baby\x1b[0m. Babies try to \x1b[92m[7] imitate\x1b[0m sounds their parents are making and to vary pitch and tone to match the language heard around them. So be patient and give your baby lots of time to ""talk"" to you. \x1b[92m[5] Praise\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Smile and applaud even the smallest or most confusing attempts at baby talk\x1b[0m. Babies learn the power of speech by the reactions of adults around them. Imitate. \x1b[92m[8] Babies love to hear their parents\' voices\x1b[0m. And when parents talk to them it helps speech develop. The more you talk their ""baby talk"" with them, using short, simple but correct words, such as ""dog"" when your baby says ""daw,"" the more babies will keep trying to talk. \x1b[92m[9] Elaborate\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] If your baby points to the table and makes noise, don\'t just give him more noodles\x1b[0m. Instead, point to the noodles and say, "" Do you want some more noodles? These noodles taste good with cheese, don\'t they?"" \x1b[92m[11] Narrate\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[12] Talk about what you\'re doing as you wash, dress, feed, and change your baby\x1b[0m -- "" Let\'s put on these blue socks now"" or "" I\'m cutting up your chicken for you"" -- so your baby connects your speech to these objects and experiences. \x1b[92m[13] Hang in there\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[14] Even when you don\'t understand what your baby is saying, keep trying\x1b[0m. Gently repeat back what you think is being said, and ask if that\'s right. Keep offering your loving attention so your baby feels rewarded for trying to talk. \x1b[92m[15] Let your child lead\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[16] During playtime, follow your child\'s attention and interests\x1b[0m to show that communication is a two-way game of talking and \x1b[92m[3] listen\x1b[0ming, leading, and following. Play. \x1b[92m[17] Encourage children to play, pretend, and imagine out loud\x1b[0m to develop verbal skills as they become toddlers. \x1b[92m[18] Read aloud\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[19] Lifelong readers come from young children who have plenty of fun, relaxing experiences of being read to out loud\x1b[0m. Watch for any sign of a major speech delay in your baby, and talk with your doctor if you sense there\'s a problem. A speech delay can happen for a number of reasons, but the earlier a speech problem in babies is diagnosed, the more time you\'ll have to correct it and help your child reach his or her full potential before school age. After consulting with your pediatrician, here are things to do to help with delayed speech: Have a hearing test done. As many as three out of 1,000 newborns have hearing loss, which can cause delayed speech development. Most states require a hearing screening in the hospital right after birth. Take your baby in for a full hearing exam by age 3 months if he or she doesn\'t pass the initial hearing screening. See a speech-language pathologist. A SLP can diagnose and treat specific speech, language, or voice disorders that delay speech. Treatment may include giving parents tips and games to improve speech problems in babies and improve a child\'s language skills. Consider developmental screening. Up to 17% of children in the U. S. have a developmental or behavioral disability such as autism spectrum disorder or cognitive disability. Ask your baby\'s doctor about screening for these developmental problems, which can cause speech delays. What\'s the first step for babies learning to talk? Encourage your baby\'s first words with your frequent cooing, babbling, talking, and singing. Keep responding positively and showing you care. When it comes to baby talk, that\'s the best building block.']",What can I do to help my baby talk?,"To help your baby talk, [92m""Watch"" [1][0m. [92m""Your baby may reach both arms up to say she wants to be picked up, hand you a toy to say she wants to play, or push food off her plate to say she's had enough"" [2][0m.

Smile, make eye contact, and respond to encourage these early, nonverbal attempts at baby talk. Listen. \x1b[92m[4] Pay attention to your baby\'s cooing and babbling, and coo and babble those same sounds right back to your baby\x1b[0m. Babies try to \x1b[92m[7] imitate\x1b[0m sounds their parents are making and to vary pitch and tone to match the language heard around them. So be patient and give your baby lots of time to ""talk"" to you. \x1b[92m[5] Praise\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Smile and applaud even the smallest or most confusing attempts at baby talk\x1b[0m. Babies learn the power of speech by the reactions of adults around them. Imitate. \x1b[92m[8] Babies love to hear their parents\' voices\x1b[0m. And when parents talk to them it helps speech develop. The more you talk their ""baby talk"" with them, using short, simple but correct words, such as ""dog"" when your baby says ""daw,"" the more babies will keep trying to talk. \x1b[92m[9] Elaborate\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] If your baby points to the table and makes noise, don\'t just give him more noodles\x1b[0m. Instead, point to the noodles and say, "" Do you want some more noodles? These noodles taste good with cheese, don\'t they?"" \x1b[92m[11] Narrate\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[12] Talk about what you\'re doing as you wash, dress, feed, and change your baby\x1b[0m -- "" Let\'s put on these blue socks now"" or "" I\'m cutting up your chicken for you"" -- so your baby connects your speech to these objects and experiences. \x1b[92m[13] Hang in there\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[14] Even when you don\'t understand what your baby is saying, keep trying\x1b[0m. Gently repeat back what you think is being said, and ask if that\'s right. Keep offering your loving attention so your baby feels rewarded for trying to talk. \x1b[92m[15] Let your child lead\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[16] During playtime, follow your child\'s attention and interests\x1b[0m to show that communication is a two-way game of talking and \x1b[92m[3] listen\x1b[0ming, leading, and following. Play. \x1b[92m[17] Encourage children to play, pretend, and imagine out loud\x1b[0m to develop verbal skills as they become toddlers. \x1b[92m[18] Read aloud\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[19] Lifelong readers come from young children who have plenty of fun, relaxing experiences of being read to out loud\x1b[0m. Watch for any sign of a major speech delay in your baby, and talk with your doctor if you sense there\'s a problem. A speech delay can happen for a number of reasons, but the earlier a speech problem in babies is diagnosed, the more time you\'ll have to correct it and help your child reach his or her full potential before school age. After consulting with your pediatrician, here are things to do to help with delayed speech: Have a hearing test done. As many as three out of 1,000 newborns have hearing loss, which can cause delayed speech development. Most states require a hearing screening in the hospital right after birth. Take your baby in for a full hearing exam by age 3 months if he or she doesn\'t pass the initial hearing screening. See a speech-language pathologist. A SLP can diagnose and treat specific speech, language, or voice disorders that delay speech. Treatment may include giving parents tips and games to improve speech problems in babies and improve a child\'s language skills. Consider developmental screening. Up to 17% of children in the U. S. have a developmental or behavioral disability such as autism spectrum disorder or cognitive disability. Ask your baby\'s doctor about screening for these developmental problems, which can cause speech delays. What\'s the first step for babies learning to talk? Encourage your baby\'s first words with your frequent cooing, babbling, talking, and singing. Keep responding positively and showing you care. When it comes to baby talk, that\'s the best building block.']",JDbKqDU0kVcpzSa,"[26.2932856082916,22.1946301460266,39.9670603275299,17.7702946662903,12.4140348434448,6.47507500648499,10.4333524703979,17.6648907661438,15.9306719303131,7.28099870681763,6.34938812255859,20.8844532966614,13.7075312137604,10.5110840797424,16.1814765930176,6.26597547531128,12.1967511177063,6.24727344512939,16.187159538269]",2024-09-06 20:57:01.349713+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":3},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":4},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":5},{""annotations"":[0],""sentence_id"":6},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":7},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":8},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":9},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":10},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":11},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":12},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":13},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":14},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":15},{""annotations"":[],""sentence_id"":16},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":17},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":18},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":19}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":3},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":4},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":5},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":6},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":7},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":8},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":9},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":10},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":11},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":12},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":13},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":14},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":15},{""coverage"":-1,""sentence_id"":16},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":17},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":18},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":19}]","[False, True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False, False, True]",3,3

132,76,"[""https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/hormone-replacement-q-a\nIt depends on how long you've been taking it and why. Here are some facts to help you decide: You may be taking HRT to relieve menopause symptoms. At one time, doctors also used to prescribe HRT to manage diseases like osteoporosis and heart disease in women past menopause. But in 2002, a Women's Health Initiative study found that women who took the most common form of HRT, a combined estrogen and progesterone pill, had a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and blood clots. HRT and Menopause Symptoms: Research shows that a small dose of HRT is still the best way to reduce uncomfortable symptoms in early menopause. Women younger than age 60 have the lowest risks of other health problems from using HRT. Several years of treatment is usually enough to relieve symptoms. So if you've been on HRT for more than 5 years, talk with your doctor about tapering off. But you should remember that after stopping, you can expect the hot flushes to return. HRT and Heart Disease: Doctors no longer prescribe hormones to manage heart disease or other chronic conditions like osteoporosis. If you're taking HRT to reduce the risk of heart disease, ask your doctor about gradually stopping it. Before the WHI study, doctors prescribed HRT for heart problems. Some earlier studies showed that women who took hormones had lower rates of heart disease and other chronic diseases. The women may have just been healthier and had better access to medical care. The WHI study and follow-ups confirmed that HRT didn't reduce the risk of heart disease; it increased it in healthy, postmenopausal women. HRT and Osteoporosis: As with heart disease, you should weigh the benefits of using hormones with other risks. To reduce osteoporosis, doctors often suggest lifestyle changes such as regular weight-bearing exercise. You can also try medicine like Fosamax and Evista, or calcium and vitamin D supplements. Or you may look at other choices, such as statins, which reduce cholesterol in the blood, but also treat osteoporosis and heart disease. Experts are still not sure. You and your doctor should talk about which form of HRT might be right for you. Low-dose hormone replacement therapy: Studies show that lower doses of hormone replacement therapy offer the same benefits without as many risks. In a new study by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where the WHI research took place, women who took low-dose estrogen had 53% fewer hot flashes and night sweats. Estrogen alone: This is the suggested treatment for women who've had a hysterectomy to remove their uterus. Women who take estrogen alone have fewer risks of breast cancer and other disorders. Still, doctors caution that taking estrogen alone can increase your risk of stroke and uterine cancer. Bio-identical estrogen patches, creams, or vaginal rings: These forms of estrogen are similar to what the body makes. Unlike a pill, they enter the body through the skin or walls of the vagina. In this way, they bypass the liver, reducing the risk of serious blood clots or gallbladder disease. There is still a risk of both, but it will be less than if you were taking the equivalent dose of oral hormones. Soy or black cohosh: Soy and black cohosh supplements contain phytoestrogens, plant materials that may act like estrogen in the body. Some studies haven't found any proof that these √¢\x80\x9cnatural√¢\x80\x9d therapies reduce menopause symptoms. Supplements aren't regulated or approved by the FDA, and phytoestrogens may increase risks for certain diseases. Antidepressants : Studies show antidepressants like Prozac and Effexor reduce hot flashes. One study found that venlafaxine, the main ingredient in Effexor, reduced hot flashes and night sweats by 48%. The results were similar to those for low-dose estrogen but without the risks.

To make it a little easier, here's a list of questions you can ask your doctor about your condition and cancer treatments. \x1b[92m[2] What kind of cancer do I have?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] What stage is it?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[4] How common is my cancer?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[5] What is my prognosis?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] What are my cancer treatment options?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[7] Are these cancer treatments proven or experimental?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[8] Are these cancer treatments covered by insurance?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[9] What should I expect from my cancer treatment?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[10] How long will it take?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[11] How successful is it usually?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[12] How will I feel?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[13] What side effects or complications could I face from my cancer treatment?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[14] In addition to treatment for cancer, will I also need to take other medicines?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[15] If so, what and for how long?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[16] Should I make any changes to my diet or lifestyle before starting cancer treatment?\x1b[0m You'll also want to ask your cancer doctor about his or her qualifications. This is really an audition: Is this doctor the right person to treat you? Here are some questions to ask before you partner with a doctor in your cancer treatment. \x1b[92m[17] How much experience do you have in treating people with my type of cancer?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[18] How many people with my cancer have you treated in the past year?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[19] Are you board certified?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[20] If so, in what specialty or subspecialty?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[21] Do you have other relevant qualifications?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[22] Do you work closely with other specialists and health care providers who could be part of my cancer treatment team?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[23] What hospitals do you work with?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[24] Would I be eligible for a clinical trial?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[25] If so, are clinical trials available at this medical center?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[26] If not, are they available in this area?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[27] Can you recommend another doctor for a second opinion?\x1b[0m You may feel awkward about quizzing your doctor about his or her experience. But doctors \x1b[92m[28] expect these questions and even welcome them\x1b[0m. Doctors want their patients to feel \x1b[92m[29] comfortable and confident in their care\x1b[0m, not intimidated. During your first few appointments with your cancer doctor, it's going to be tough to keep track of all the details. You'll be flooded with information: the names of doctors, medications, cancer treatments, and inevitably, a good dose of medical jargon. Here are some ways to make your appointments as useful as possible. Take notes. Always go to your meetings with a pad and paper to write things down. You may also want to record your visit. Bring a partner. Obviously, a friend or loved one can provide moral support during a tense conversation. But he or she can also play an important practical role. Your partner may remember details that you were simply too overwhelmed to take in. Or he or she may prompt you to ask important questions that you forgot. Ask for information to bring home. At the end of your meeting, see if your doctor has any literature or other sources of information about your cancer or the cancer treatments he or she has recommended.

But along with your treatment plan, there are some good ways to manage the condition. It helps to know how the disease can affect your life, so you can make changes that will help. There's no cure for HS, so you'll have to manage the condition for life. \x1b[92m[3] For most people, it's a cycle of flare-ups and periods when their skin is clear\x1b[0m. Breakouts tend to happen in the same general areas of your skin. But you may have a spot that stays broken-out all the time. Some women find their HS clears up after menopause. HS is called a progressive disease. That means it often gets worse over time. A small pimple can turn into a large boil within days or hours. If the boil ruptures underneath the skin, inflammation and infection spread quickly and new lumps form nearby. A flare-up may last a week or two. But treatment can keep HS from getting worse and help you avoid the most serious symptoms. The key is to start it early. Your symptoms and the way your body responds to treatment will determine how often you see your doctor. You may be able to manage mild symptoms on your own. If you take a drug that's injected or delivered through a vein, you may need to go in regularly. People with HS tend to have other conditions, too, such as severe acne, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Doctors don't know exactly why these conditions are linked. But it may be that whatever causes HS leads to other problems, too. It's rare, but people who have HS for a long time may be more likely to get a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. It's important to see your doctor regularly, keep her updated on how you feel, and talk about any new or unusual symptoms you've noticed. It depends on \x1b[92m[4] how severe your condition is\x1b[0m. Large, deep nodules or lumps can hurt. And depending on where they are, you may not be able to sit or walk normally. Some people only get these painful lumps from time to time when the disease flares. But for others, the bumps or lumps never completely go away. Whether you have pain only during flares or more often, your doctor can help you control it. You may get numbing creams or over-the-counter or prescription pain medicine. The lumps themselves don't smell, but the fluid inside them does. When they burst and leak, the odor can escape, too. Wear loose clothing and try to keep things from rubbing against the cysts. Don't squeeze them. If they do burst, wash the area gently with an antiseptic cleanser to get rid of the smell. Antibiotics may also help. \x1b[92m[5] HS can be unpredictable\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] You may have a flare-up every few weeks, or you may go months with clear skin\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Some women find they have breakouts before their periods\x1b[0m. They may go away while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. There's no sure way to prevent breakouts. But they may not come back as often or be as bad if you follow your treatment plan, take any medication your doctor prescribes, and make some changes to your lifestyle. Get to a healthy weight. \x1b[92m[8] HS is closely tied to obesity\x1b[0m. Losing weight is one of the best ways to keep it under control. Quit smoking. Stay cool. \x1b[92m[9] Your HS may get worse in the summer, when heat and sweat can trigger a flare-up\x1b[0m. Swimming is a good way to get exercise without overheating. Don't shave near a breakout. If your razor irritates your skin, laser hair removal may be a better choice. Watch what you eat. There's some evidence that it may help to cut dairy and sugar from your diet.

Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it\'s important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin\'s surface. Washing more often than twice daily is not necessarily better; it may do more harm than good. Use warm, not hot, water and a mild facial cleanser. Using a harsh soap (like deodorant body soap) can hurt already inflamed skin and cause more irritation. Avoid scrubbing your skin harshly with a washcloth, an exfoliating glove, or loofah (a coarse-textured sponge). Gently wash it with a very soft cloth or your hands. Always rinse well, and then dry your face with a clean towel. ( Toss the towel in the laundry hamper, as dirty towels spread bacteria.) Also, use the washcloth only once. 2. Moisturize. Many acne products contain ingredients that dry the skin, so always use a moisturizer that minimizes dryness and skin peeling. Look for ""noncomedogenic"" on the label, which means it should not cause acne. There are moisturizers made for oily, dry, or combination skin. 3. Try an over-the-counter acne product. These acne products don\'t need a prescription. Most of them have ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid, which curb bacteria and dry your skin. They may cause drying or peeling so start with a small amount at first. Then you can adjust how much you use and how often. Another option is a new OTC topical retinoid gel ( Differin 0.1% gel). It works to actually keep the acne from forming. Use these products with caution if you have sensitive skin. 4. Use makeup sparingly. During a breakout, avoid wearing foundation, powder, or blush. If you do wear makeup, wash it off at the end of the day. If possible, choose oil-free cosmetics without added dyes and chemicals. Choose makeup that is labeled as ""noncomedogenic,"" meaning it should not cause acne. Read the ingredients list on the product label before buying. 5. Watch what you put on your hair. Avoid using fragrances, oils, pomades, or gels on your hair. If they get on your face, they can block your skin\'s pores and irritate your skin. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Oily hair can add to the oil on your face, so wash your hair often, especially if you\'re breaking out. Got long hair? Keep it pulled away from your face. 6. Keep your hands off your face. Avoid touching your face or propping your cheek or chin on your hands. Not only can you spread bacteria, you can also irritate the already inflamed facial skin. Never pick or pop pimples with your fingers, as it can lead to infection and scarring. 7. Stay out of the sun. The sun\'s ultraviolet rays can increase inflammation and redness, and can cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark discoloration). Some acne medications may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Limit your time in the sun, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and wear protective clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and a broad-brimmed hat. Whether you have pimples or not, always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with 6% zinc oxide or higher and SPF 30 or higher at least 20 minutes before sun exposure. Look for ""noncomedogenic"" on the sunscreen label to make new pimples less likely. Read the ingredients on the product label to know what you\'re putting on your skin. 8. Feed your skin. \x1b[92m[1] Most experts agree that certain foods, like chocolate, don\'t cause pimples\x1b[0m. Still, \x1b[92m[2] it makes sense to avoid greasy food and junk food and add more fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains to your diet\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Dairy products and foods high in processed sugar may trigger acne\x1b[0m. Avoid these. 9. Exercise daily. Regular exercise is good for your whole body, including your skin. When you exercise, avoid wearing clothing or using exercise equipment that rubs your skin and may cause irritation. Shower or bathe right after exercise. 10. Chill! Some studies link stress with the severity of pimples or acne. Ask yourself what\'s making you feel stressed. Then look for solutions.

136,156,"[""https://www.webmd.com/allergies/peanut-allergy\nPeanuts were once a snack-time staple, but these days, they are largely off-limits for a growing number of kids and adults. It's common now not to serve certain foods at birthday parties or school to keep kids with peanut allergies safe. It can seem scary how much damage a little piece of food can do, but you can lower the risk of having a severe reaction if you learn how to spot your symptoms and avoid peanuts. Children -- especially toddlers and infants -- are more likely to develop food allergies. If you or other family members have other types of allergies, peanuts could be a problem. Also, if you have eczema, you may also be more likely to be allergic. If you have peanut allergy, that doesn't have to mean you are more likely to have a problem with other nuts or legumes. Peanuts grow underground and are different from almonds, cashews, walnuts and other tree nuts. Recent studies found that 25% to 40% of people who have peanut allergy are allergic to tree nuts, too. \x1b[92m[1] Most people who are allergic have trouble when they have direct contact with peanuts -- whether eating them by accident or not realizing they are part of a salad or recipe\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] It can also happen through skin contact or by breathing in peanut dust or eating something made with peanut oil\x1b[0m. But did you know that \x1b[92m[3] if you are very sensitive, indirect contact can trigger a reaction\x1b[0m? It's called cross-contact. For instance, a chef might be making a meal for you. It contains no peanuts, but she may have used her knife for an earlier task. If the knife touched peanuts and wasn't washed well, trace pieces could get into your dish. Make sure any restaurant or dinner host is aware and taking care to avoid cross-contact. Symptoms of an allergic response to peanuts will usually start within minutes of exposure, and they can include: Tightening in the throat Shortness of breath or wheezing Skin reaction such as hives or redness Tingling or itching in the mouth or throat Diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps or vomiting A runny nose This is a life-threatening allergic reaction and \x1b[92m[6] needs emergency treatment\x1b[0m. Peanuts are \x1b[92m[5] one of the most common causes of anaphylaxis\x1b[0m, which can affect several parts of the body all at once. Your risk may be higher if you have allergies or asthma, a family history of anaphylaxis or if it's happened to you before. Certain people with known peanut allergies should carry an injector. You can get one from your doctor. If the symptoms strike, use your epinephrine (adrenaline) injector, such as Adrenaclick, Auvi- Q, Epi Pen, Symjepi or a generic version of the auto-injector.. Call 911 even if you start to feel better. You will still need emergency medical care because you may have a delayed reaction. The signs of an attack include: Swelling of the throat that makes it hard to breathe Dizziness or fainting A big drop in blood pressure A rapid pulse Blocked airways To find out whether you have a problem with peanuts, your doctor might ask you to keep a food diary.

138,92,"[""https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hearing-loss-prevention\nMany adults eventually realize they're pressing the √¢\x80\x9cvolume up√¢\x80\x9d button on the TV remote more often, or that a lot of people around them need to speak up. There are two common reasons people start to lose their hearing: Age: As you get older, the tiny hair cells in your inner ears slowly break down and can't pick up sound vibrations as well as they used to. Noise: A lot of loud sound over time can damage the hair cells in your ears. The good news? You can do some things to avoid \x1b[92m[1] noise-induced hearing loss\x1b[0m and keep age-related hearing loss from getting worse. Here are eight tips to help keep your ears as sharp as possible. How loud is too loud? If you have to shout over the noise around you, it's loud enough to damage your hearing. Sounds from motorcycles, concert speakers, power tools like saws and drills, earphones, and more are all loud enough to make a difference. Think about buying appliances and devices that have low noise ratings. And if it's too loud in the movie theater, restaurant, or any other place you go often, ask the manager to turn it down. Sometimes you can't avoid the blare of an ambulance siren or the jackhammer on your street corner. But it's best to \x1b[92m[3] limit the amount of time you're around\x1b[0m them. Noise-induced hearing loss is \x1b[92m[2] a result of the loudness of sounds and how long you hear them\x1b[0m. If you know you're going to be around loud sounds for more than a few minutes, think about \x1b[92m[4] wearing protection, such as: Earplugs\x1b[0m. Usually made of foam or rubber, they go in your ear canal and \x1b[92m[5] can reduce noise by 15 to 30 decibels\x1b[0m. You can buy them off-the-shelf or have them custom-made to fit you. Some earplugs lower noise levels evenly across all frequencies. They're useful for people who need to make sound quieter but undistorted, such as musicians. \x1b[92m[6] Earmuffs\x1b[0m. These fit completely over your ears and \x1b[92m[7] reduce sounds by about 15 to 30 decibels\x1b[0m. They have to fit tightly over both ears to block sound. You can also wear earplugs and earmuffs together for even greater protection. Tobacco can make you more likely to lose your hearing, too, research shows. So if you light up, that's one more good reason to quit. If you aren't a smoker, avoid breathing secondhand smoke. A buildup of wax in your ears can muffle sound. But don't use a cotton swab to clean them out -- they can push wax deeper in. Instead, use an at-home irrigation kit to soften wax and gently wash it out.

There are two common reasons people start to lose their hearing: Age: As you get older, the tiny hair cells in your inner ears slowly break down and can't pick up sound vibrations as well as they used to. Noise: A lot of loud sound over time can damage the hair cells in your ears. The good news? You can do some things to avoid noise-induced hearing loss and keep age-related hearing loss from getting worse. Here are eight tips to help keep your ears as sharp as possible. How loud is too loud? If you have to shout over the noise around you, it's loud enough to damage your hearing. Sounds from motorcycles, concert speakers, power tools like saws and drills, earphones, and more are all loud enough to make a difference. Think about buying appliances and devices that have low noise ratings. And if it's too loud in the movie theater, restaurant, or any other place you go often, ask the manager to turn it down. Sometimes you can't avoid the blare of an ambulance siren or the jackhammer on your street corner. But it's best to limit the amount of time you're around them. Noise-induced hearing loss is a result of the loudness of sounds and how long you hear them. If you know you're going to be around loud sounds for more than a few minutes, think about wearing protection, such as: Earplugs. Usually made of foam or rubber, they go in your ear canal and can reduce noise by 15 to 30 decibels. You can buy them off-the-shelf or have them custom-made to fit you. Some earplugs lower noise levels evenly across all frequencies. They're useful for people who need to make sound quieter but undistorted, such as musicians. Earmuffs. These fit completely over your ears and reduce sounds by about 15 to 30 decibels. They have to fit tightly over both ears to block sound. You can also wear earplugs and earmuffs together for even greater protection. Tobacco can make you more likely to lose your hearing, too, research shows. So if you light up, that's one more good reason to quit. If you aren't a smoker, avoid breathing secondhand smoke. A buildup of wax in your ears can muffle sound. But don't use a cotton swab to clean them out -- they can push wax deeper in. Instead, use an at-home irrigation kit to soften wax and gently wash it out.

You may have: Aching pain in your belly (sometimes severe) Feeling of pressure in your belly Pain in the hips, lower back, and inner thighs When cramps are severe, symptoms may include: Upset stomach, sometimes with vomiting Loose stools Menstrual cramps happen because of contractions in the uterus, or womb, which is a muscle. If it contracts too strongly during your menstrual cycle, it can press against nearby blood vessels. This briefly cuts off the supply of oxygen to the uterus. It's this lack of oxygen causes your pain and cramping. If you have mild menstrual cramps, take aspirin or another pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen.
