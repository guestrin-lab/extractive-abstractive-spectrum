He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 'Billboard' Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single 'Candle in the Wind 1997', rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, 'Empty Sky', was released. In 1970, his first hit single, 'Your Song', from his second album, 'Elton John', reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for 'The Lion King' and its stage adaptation, 'Aida' and 'Billy Elliot the Musical'. John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, 'Rolling Stone' ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, 'Billboard' ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the 'Billboard' Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for 'services to music and charitable services' in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over £300 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. Presenting John with France's highest civilian award, the Legion d'honneur, in 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called him a 'melodic genius' and praised his work on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2018, John embarked on a three-year farewell tour. "", ""'Sick City' is a 1974 song with music written by Elton John and lyrics by Bernie Taupin.

Williams recorded it as a demo in 1949 in Nashville and it was released as a posthumous single by MGM Records in 1957. "", ""Hiram 'Hank' Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation 'for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.'

"", ""Hiram 'Hank' Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others.

"", ""Hank Williams\n\x1b[96m[2] Hiram 'Hank' Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician\x1b[0m. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation 'for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.'

It stars Jennifer Jones, James Mason, Van Heflin, Louis Jourdan, Alf Kjellin (billed as Christopher Kent), Gene Lockhart, Frank Allenby and Gladys Cooper. It was directed by Vincente Minnelli and produced by Pandro S. Berman, from a screenplay by Robert Ardrey based on the Flaubert novel. The music score was by Miklós Rózsa, the cinematography by Robert H. Planck and the art direction by Cedric Gibbons and Jack Martin Smith. The film was a project of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios and Lana Turner was set to star, but when pregnancy forced her to withdraw, Jones stepped into the title role.

A plot device which structured the story around author Flaubert's obscenity trial was developed to placate the censors. The highlight of the film is an elaborately choreographed ball sequence set to composer Miklós Rózsa's lush film score.

Williams recorded it as a demo in 1949 in Nashville and it was released as a posthumous single by MGM Records in 1957. "", ""Hiram 'Hank' Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation 'for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.'

Playwright Tennessee Williams became an admirer of her acting and wrote 'The Rose Tattoo' specifically for her to star in, a role for which she received an Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Italian ever to win an Oscar.

As an actress she became recognized for her dynamic and forceful portrayals of 'earthy lower-class women' in such films as 'L'Amore' (1948), 'Bellissima' (1951), 'The Rose Tattoo' (1955), 'The Fugitive Kind' (1960) and 'Mamma Roma' (1962).

He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage.

She was a granddaughter of Norman Forbes-Robertson and great-niece of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson. After making her stage debut with her father's touring company in 1929 she progressed via provincial repertory to the West End, where she appeared continually from the 1930s to the 1970s. She married the actor Ralph Richardson in 1944, and the couple regularly appeared together in London, and on tour in the UK, continental Europe, Australia and North and South America. She made her first film in 1934 and made fourteen more films between then and 1969. "", ""Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.

Nicknamed 'The Brazilian Bombshell', Miranda is noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in her American films. As a young woman, she designed hats in a boutique before making her first recordings with composer Josué de Barros in 1929. Miranda's 1930 recording of 'Taí (Pra Você Gostar de Mim)', written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba. During the 1930s Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian 'chanchadas', films celebrating Brazilian music, dance, and the country's carnival culture. ' Hello, Hello Brazil!' and 'Hello, Hello, Carnival!' embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical 'Banana da Terra' (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her 'Baiana' image, inspired by African-Brazilians from the northeastern state of Bahia. In 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in 'The Streets of Paris' after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, 'Down Argentine Way' with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Lusophone accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's 'The Gang's All Here,' which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States. Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical 'Brazilian Bombshell' image she had cultivated, and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. In 1941 she was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her hand and footprints in the courtyard of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and was the first South American honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

He was, therefore, a younger half-brother of King Edward II (1307–1327) and a full brother of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent. He occupied the office of Earl Marshal of England. ', ""Edward I (17/18 June 1239 – 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots , was King of England from 1272 to 1307. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems. Edward I was a tall man (6'2') for his era, hence the nickname 'Longshanks'. He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657.

110,110,77,"[""Alan Bridges (28 September 1927 – 7 December 2013) was an English film and television director. In 1967 Bridges directed a television adaptation of Charles Dickens' 'Great Expectations' starring Gary Bond as Pip. He won the 'Grand Prix' at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival for his film 'The Hireling'. His film 'Out of Season' (1975) was entered into the 25th Berlin International Film Festival and film 'The Shooting Party' (1985) was entered into the 14th Moscow International Film Festival.

Nicknamed 'The Brazilian Bombshell', Miranda is noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in her American films. As a young woman, she designed hats in a boutique before making her first recordings with composer Josué de Barros in 1929. Miranda's 1930 recording of 'Taí (Pra Você Gostar de Mim)', written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba. During the 1930s Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian 'chanchadas', films celebrating Brazilian music, dance, and the country's carnival culture. ' Hello, Hello Brazil!' and 'Hello, Hello, Carnival!' embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical 'Banana da Terra' (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her 'Baiana' image, inspired by African-Brazilians from the northeastern state of Bahia. In 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in 'The Streets of Paris' after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, 'Down Argentine Way' with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Lusophone accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's 'The Gang's All Here,' which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States. Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical 'Brazilian Bombshell' image she had cultivated, and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. In 1941 she was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her hand and footprints in the courtyard of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and was the first South American honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's 'The Gang's All Here,' which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States. Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical 'Brazilian Bombshell' image she had cultivated, and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. In 1941 she was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her hand and footprints in the courtyard of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and was the first South American honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Miranda is considered the precursor of Brazil's 1960s Tropicalismo cultural movement. A museum was built in Rio de Janeiro in her honor, and in 1995 she was the subject of the documentary .

133,133,200,"['Womb( retitled Clone for its UK DVD release) is a 2010 science fiction drama film written and directed by Benedek Fliegauf and starring Eva Green and Matt Smith. ', ""Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a 1997 film by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. It profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, who is a lion tamer; George Mendonça, who created topiaries at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, including giraffes made out of boxwood; Ray Mendez, a hairless mole-rats expert; and Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. scientist who has designed bug-like robots. The film's musical score is by composer Caleb Sampson, and is performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience. The invention is called the Interrotron. His four subjects narrate the film in their own words. The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'. In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. The film is extensively cut with scenes from older films and television shows. The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover's idol Clyde Beatty appears from portions of his film 'Darkest Africa' and a malicious robot appears in scenes from 'Zombies of the Stratosphere'. After using the first moments in the film to establish his characters one by one, with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another, in order to correlate the themes which the four subjects have in common. The title of the film is a play on the old engineer's adage that out of 'fast,cheap,' and 'reliable,' you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car). Rodney Brooks, the robot scientist from MIT, wrote a paper in which he speculates that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space, instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring. The paper was fully titled 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System', and published in the 'Journal of the British Interplanetary Society' in 1989. The film is available on VHS, DVD; the soundtrack by Caleb Sampson is available on CD. "", ""Benedek' Bence' Fliegauf( born 15 August 1974 in Budapest) is a Hungarian film director and screenwriter.

', ""Fast, Cheap & Out of Control\n\x1b[96m[3] Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a 1997 film by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris\x1b[0m. It profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, who is a lion tamer; George Mendonça, who created topiaries at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, including giraffes made out of boxwood; Ray Mendez, a hairless mole-rats expert; and Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. scientist who has designed bug-like robots. The film's musical score is by composer Caleb Sampson, and is performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience. The invention is called the Interrotron. His four subjects narrate the film in their own words. The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'. In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. The film is extensively cut with scenes from older films and television shows. The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover's idol Clyde Beatty appears from portions of his film 'Darkest Africa' and a malicious robot appears in scenes from 'Zombies of the Stratosphere'. After using the first moments in the film to establish his characters one by one, with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another, in order to correlate the themes which the four subjects have in common. The title of the film is a play on the old engineer's adage that out of 'fast,cheap,' and 'reliable,' you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car). Rodney Brooks, the robot scientist from MIT, wrote a paper in which he speculates that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space, instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring. The paper was fully titled 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System', and published in the 'Journal of the British Interplanetary Society' in 1989. The film is available on VHS, DVD; the soundtrack by Caleb Sampson is available on CD.

The film co-stars Theodore Bikel and Jay Novello. The film's storyline concerns a British Royal Navy artillery officer (Grant) who has orders to retrieve a huge siege cannon from Spain and transport it by ship to British forces. But first, the leader of the Spanish guerrillas (Sinatra) wants to transport the weapon 1,000 km across Spain to help in the recapture of the city of Ávila from the occupying French before he releases it to the British. Most of the film deals with the hardships of transporting the big gun to Ávila across rivers and through mountains, while also evading the occupying French forces that have been ordered to find it. A subplot concerns the struggle for the love of the Spanish woman Juana (Loren) by the two male protagonists. The screen story and screenplay by Edna Anhalt and Edward Anhalt was loosely based on the 1933 novel 'The Gun' by C. S. Forester. Earl Felton did an uncredited screenplay re-write, George Antheil composed the music score, while Saul Bass designed the opening title sequence. The film's music score was the last important work by George Antheil, once famous as the 'bad boy of music' in the 1920s.

"", ""Stanley Earl Kramer (September 29, 1913February 19, 2001) was an American film director and producer, responsible for making many of Hollywood's most famous 'message films'. As an independent producer and director, he brought attention to topical social issues that most studios avoided. Among the subjects covered in his films were racism (in 'The Defiant Ones' and 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'), nuclear war (in 'On the Beach'), greed (in 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'), creationism vs. evolution (in 'Inherit the Wind') and the causes and effects of fascism (in 'Judgment at Nuremberg'). His other notable films included 'High Noon' (1952, as producer), 'The Caine Mutiny' (1954, as producer), and 'Ship of Fools' (1965). Director Steven Spielberg described him as an 'incredibly talented visionary', and 'one of our great filmmakers, not just for the art and passion he put on screen, but for the impact he has made on the conscience of the world.' Kramer was recognized for his fierce independence as a producer-director, with author Victor Navasky writing that 'among the independents . . . none seemed more vocal, more liberal, more pugnacious than young Stanley Kramer.' His friend, Kevin Spacey, during his acceptance speech at the 2015 Golden Globes, honored Kramer's work, calling him 'one of the great filmmakers of all time.' Despite uneven critical reception, both then and now, Kramer's body of work has received many awards, including 16 Academy Awards and 80 nominations, and he was nominated nine times as either producer or director. In 1961, he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival.

Directed by Catherine Hardwicke, the film stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. It is the first film in 'The Twilight Saga' film series. This film focuses on the development of the relationship between Bella Swan (a teenage girl) and Edward Cullen (a vampire), and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a coven of evil vampires. The project was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures, during which time a screen adaptation that differed significantly from the novel was written. Summit Entertainment acquired the rights to the novel after three years of the project's stagnant development. Melissa Rosenberg wrote a new adaptation of the novel shortly before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and sought to be faithful to the novel's storyline. Principal photography took 44 days and was completed on May 2, 2008; the film was primarily shot in Oregon. 'Twilight' was theatrically released on November 21, 2008; it grossed over US$393 million worldwide. It was released on DVD March 21, 2009 and became the most purchased DVD of the year. The soundtrack was released on November 4, 2008. Following the film's success, 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse', the next two novels in the series, were produced as films the following year. "", ""Robert Bernard Altman (February 20, 1925 – November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a 'maverick' in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema. His style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a 'subversive' twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Altman developed a reputation for being 'anti-Hollywood' and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity. He preferred large ensemble casts for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic Pauline Kael, writing about his directing style, said that Altman could 'make film fireworks out of next to nothing.' In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman's body of work with an Academy Honorary Award. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations. His films 'MASH' (1970), 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller' (1971), and 'Nashville' (1975) have been selected for the United States National Film Registry.

The single also topped the Swedish singles chart between 24 September and 5 November 1986, becoming Magnus Uggla's first number-one single in Sweden. The song also charted at Trackslistan for five weeks between 20 September 1986 – 17 January 1987, topping the chart during the second and third position. The song also charted at Svensktoppen for nine weeks between 12 October–7 December 1986, peaking at second position during the six first weeks.

178,178,77,"[""Alan Bridges (28 September 1927 – 7 December 2013) was an English film and television director. In 1967 Bridges directed a television adaptation of Charles Dickens' 'Great Expectations' starring Gary Bond as Pip. He won the 'Grand Prix' at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival for his film 'The Hireling'. His film 'Out of Season' (1975) was entered into the 25th Berlin International Film Festival and film 'The Shooting Party' (1985) was entered into the 14th Moscow International Film Festival.

In 1969, he made his first feature film 'Invasión' in his native Argentina based on an idea by celebrated writers Adolfo Bioy Casares and Jorge Luis Borges, who also co-wrote the script. Adolfo Bioy Casares described the film in May 1969 as follows:Invasión' modernises the theme of The Iliad: it does not praise the shrewdness and effectiveness of the conqueror, but rather the courage of a handful of warriors ready to defend their Troy-which is far too much like Buenos Aires-where there is always a group of friends and a tango inviting you to fight for just and noble causes.

Williams recorded it as a demo in 1949 in Nashville and it was released as a posthumous single by MGM Records in 1957. "", ""Hiram 'Hank' Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation 'for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.'

Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation 'for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.'

240,240,97,"[""Twilight is a 2008 American romantic fantasy film based on Stephenie Meyer's 2005 novel of the same name. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke, the film stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. It is the first film in 'The Twilight Saga' film series. This film focuses on the development of the relationship between Bella Swan (a teenage girl) and Edward Cullen (a vampire), and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a coven of evil vampires. The project was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures, during which time a screen adaptation that differed significantly from the novel was written. Summit Entertainment acquired the rights to the novel after three years of the project's stagnant development. Melissa Rosenberg wrote a new adaptation of the novel shortly before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and sought to be faithful to the novel's storyline. Principal photography took 44 days and was completed on May 2, 2008; the film was primarily shot in Oregon. 'Twilight' was theatrically released on November 21, 2008; it grossed over US$393 million worldwide. It was released on DVD March 21, 2009 and became the most purchased DVD of the year. The soundtrack was released on November 4, 2008. Following the film's success, 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse', the next two novels in the series, were produced as films the following year. "", ""Robert Bernard Altman (February 20, 1925 – November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a 'maverick' in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema. His style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a 'subversive' twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Altman developed a reputation for being 'anti-Hollywood' and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity. He preferred large ensemble casts for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic Pauline Kael, writing about his directing style, said that Altman could 'make film fireworks out of next to nothing.' In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman's body of work with an Academy Honorary Award. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations. His films 'MASH' (1970), 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller' (1971), and 'Nashville' (1975) have been selected for the United States National Film Registry.

She \x1b[92m[1] was referred to as 'La Lupa,' the 'perennial toast of Rome' and a 'living she-wolf symbol' of the cinema\x1b[0m. 'Time' magazine described her personality as 'fiery', and drama critic Harold Clurman said her acting was 'volcanic'. In the realm of Italian cinema she was 'passionate, fearless, and exciting,' an actress that film historian Barry Monush calls 'the volcanic earth mother of all Italian cinema.' Director Roberto Rossellini called her 'the greatest acting genius since Eleonora Duse'. Playwright Tennessee Williams became an admirer of her acting and wrote 'The Rose Tattoo' specifically for her to star in, a role for which she received an Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Italian ever to win an Oscar. After meeting director \x1b[92m[2] Goffredo Alessandrini she received her first screen role\x1b[0m in 'La cieca di SorrentoThe Blind Woman of Sorrento') (1934) and later achieved international fame in Rossellini's 'Rome, Open City' (1945) , considered the first significant movie to launch the Italian neorealism movement in cinema. As an actress she became recognized for her dynamic and forceful portrayals of 'earthy lower-class women' in such films as 'L'Amore' (1948), 'Bellissima' (1951), 'The Rose Tattoo' (1955), 'The Fugitive Kind' (1960) and 'Mamma Roma' (1962).

He was born in Dookie, Victoria in 1925, and attended Assumption College, Kilmore. He qualified in medicine at the University of Melbourne in 1948. He led the first St Vincent’s Hospital civilian surgical team to work in Long Xuyen, Vietnam, from October 1965 - January 1966. In 1986 he was made Hunterian Professor of Surgery by the Royal College of Surgeons (London) and delivered his oration on diverticular disease. In 1988 he published 'A Very Short Textbook of Surgery' (3rd edition, 1994, Chapman and Hall, London), and this was also translated into Indonesian and Mandarin. He also worked as an honorary consultant surgeon one morning per month for almost 20 years from 1981, at the VAHS (Victorian Aboriginal Health Service). He died from cancer on 3 June 2002. Ryan was President of the International Society of University Colon and Rectal Surgeons from 1986 to 1988 and colorectal cancer was a major medical study of his professional life. Ryan chaired the ISUCRS's Congress in Melbourne in 1980. Another of his medical lifetime interests was road safety and driving.

Nicknamed 'The Brazilian Bombshell', Miranda is noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in her American films. As a young woman, she designed hats in a boutique before making her first recordings with composer Josué de Barros in 1929. Miranda's 1930 recording of 'Taí (Pra Você Gostar de Mim)', written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba. During the 1930s Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian 'chanchadas', films celebrating Brazilian music, dance, and the country's carnival culture. ' Hello, Hello Brazil!' and 'Hello, Hello, Carnival!' embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical 'Banana da Terra' (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her 'Baiana' image, inspired by African-Brazilians from the northeastern state of Bahia. In 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in 'The Streets of Paris' after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, 'Down Argentine Way' with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Lusophone accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's 'The Gang's All Here,' which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States. Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical 'Brazilian Bombshell' image she had cultivated, and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. In 1941 she was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her hand and footprints in the courtyard of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and was the first South American honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

She married the actor Ralph Richardson in 1944, and the couple regularly appeared together in London, and on tour in the UK, continental Europe, Australia and North and South America.

"", ""Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage.

He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical. ""]","[""\x1b[92m Meriel Forbes, Lady Richardson (13 September 1913 – 7 April 2000) was an English actress\x1b[0m. She was a granddaughter of Norman Forbes-Robertson and great-niece of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson. After making her stage debut with her father's touring company in 1929 she progressed via provincial repertory to the West End, where she appeared continually from the 1930s to the 1970s. She \x1b[92m married the actor Ralph Richardson in 1944\x1b[0m, and the couple regularly appeared together in London, and on tour in the UK, continental Europe, Australia and North and South America. She made her first film in 1934 and made fourteen more films between then and 1969. "", ""\x1b[96m Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor\x1b[0m who, along with his contemporaries Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty.

"", ""The Naked Brothers Band is an 2007 American children's musical comedy film written and directed by Polly Draper, which stars her sons, Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, who portray members of a fictional rock group. It tells of the boys' struggles with their fame and an internal dispute that causes the band to split before reuniting in the end. The film is emboldened by Nat's band, The Silver Boulders, which he created in preschool with his friends Joshua Kaye, Thomas Batuello, and David Levi, who all portray themselves. It also includes Allie DiMeco as Nat's fictional female interest, the siblings' real- life cousin Jesse Draper as the group's babysitter, Draper's husband Michael Wolff playing his sons' widowed accordion- playing dad, and real life friends Cooper Pillot and Cole Hawkins portraying the other members of the band. Draper shot the film in the style of a mockumentary — a parody in documentary format—that depicts the daily activities of the characters. Nat composed and performed the music, yet one song had been written by Alex. Principal photography took place in mid-2004 on location in New York City, and the interior scenes were vastly filmed in the family's Manhattan apartment. Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, provided financial incentives for the shoot. In late 2005, Polly Draper, known for her role in' Thirtysomething', and her jazz musician husband Michael Wolff entered the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival, where it won the audience award. Former Nickelodeon president Albie Hecht attended the screening and purchased the movie, in association with his Worldwide Biggies label. It became the pilot for the subsequent Nickelodeon show of the same name, airing in the United States on January 27, 2007. The series was created and produced by Draper and premiered in February 2007, to the channel's highest ratings in seven years for viewers in the 6–11 age group.

In 1969, he made his first feature film 'Invasión' in his native Argentina based on an idea by celebrated writers Adolfo Bioy Casares and Jorge Luis Borges, who also co-wrote the script. Adolfo Bioy Casares described the film in May 1969 as follows:Invasión' modernises the theme of The Iliad: it does not praise the shrewdness and effectiveness of the conqueror, but rather the courage of a handful of warriors ready to defend their Troy-which is far too much like Buenos Aires-where there is always a group of friends and a tango inviting you to fight for just and noble causes.

He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 'Billboard' Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single 'Candle in the Wind 1997', rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold.

John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for 'The Lion King' and its stage adaptation, 'Aida' and 'Billy Elliot the Musical'. John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor.

Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, 'Empty Sky', was released. In 1970, his first hit single, 'Your Song', from his second album, 'Elton John', reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for 'The Lion King' and its stage adaptation, 'Aida' and 'Billy Elliot the Musical'. John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, 'Rolling Stone' ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era.

John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over £300 million. \x1b[92m[3] John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014\x1b[0m.

318,318,139,"[""The Pride and the Passion is a 1957 Napoleonic era war film in Technicolor and VistaVision from United Artists, produced and directed by Stanley Kramer, that stars Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, and Sophia Loren. The film co-stars Theodore Bikel and Jay Novello. The film's storyline concerns a British Royal Navy artillery officer (Grant) who has orders to retrieve a huge siege cannon from Spain and transport it by ship to British forces. But first, the leader of the Spanish guerrillas (Sinatra) wants to transport the weapon 1,000 km across Spain to help in the recapture of the city of Ávila from the occupying French before he releases it to the British. Most of the film deals with the hardships of transporting the big gun to Ávila across rivers and through mountains, while also evading the occupying French forces that have been ordered to find it. A subplot concerns the struggle for the love of the Spanish woman Juana (Loren) by the two male protagonists. The screen story and screenplay by Edna Anhalt and Edward Anhalt was loosely based on the 1933 novel 'The Gun' by C. S. Forester. Earl Felton did an uncredited screenplay re-write, George Antheil composed the music score, while Saul Bass designed the opening title sequence. The film's music score was the last important work by George Antheil, once famous as the 'bad boy of music' in the 1920s. It is the only one of Antheil's many film scores to have been preserved on a commercial soundtrack recording. "", ""Stanley Earl Kramer (September 29, 1913February 19, 2001) was an American film director and producer, responsible for making many of Hollywood's most famous 'message films'. As an independent producer and director, he brought attention to topical social issues that most studios avoided. Among the subjects covered in his films were racism (in 'The Defiant Ones' and 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'), nuclear war (in 'On the Beach'), greed (in 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'), creationism vs. evolution (in 'Inherit the Wind') and the causes and effects of fascism (in 'Judgment at Nuremberg'). His other notable films included 'High Noon' (1952, as producer), 'The Caine Mutiny' (1954, as producer), and 'Ship of Fools' (1965). Director Steven Spielberg described him as an 'incredibly talented visionary', and 'one of our great filmmakers, not just for the art and passion he put on screen, but for the impact he has made on the conscience of the world.' Kramer was recognized for his fierce independence as a producer-director, with author Victor Navasky writing that 'among the independents . . . none seemed more vocal, more liberal, more pugnacious than young Stanley Kramer.' His friend, Kevin Spacey, during his acceptance speech at the 2015 Golden Globes, honored Kramer's work, calling him 'one of the great filmmakers of all time.' Despite uneven critical reception, both then and now, Kramer's body of work has received many awards, including 16 Academy Awards and 80 nominations, and he was nominated nine times as either producer or director. In 1961, he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival.

The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia. Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east.

347,347,72,"[""Anna Maria Magnani (7 March 1908 – 26 September 1973) was an Italian stage and film actress. Widely regarded as one of the greatest actresses of Italian and World cinema, she was known for her explosive acting and earthy, real life portrayals of characters. Born in Rome, she worked her way through Rome's Academy of Dramatic Art by singing at night clubs. During her career, her only child was stricken by polio when he was 18 months old and remained crippled. She was referred to as 'La Lupa,' the 'perennial toast of Rome' and a 'living she-wolf symbol' of the cinema. 'Time' magazine described her personality as 'fiery', and drama critic Harold Clurman said her acting was 'volcanic'. In the realm of Italian cinema she was 'passionate, fearless, and exciting,' an actress that film historian Barry Monush calls 'the volcanic earth mother of all Italian cinema.' Director Roberto Rossellini called her 'the greatest acting genius since Eleonora Duse'.

Director Roberto Rossellini called her 'the greatest acting genius since Eleonora Duse'. Playwright Tennessee Williams became an admirer of her acting and wrote 'The Rose Tattoo' specifically for her to star in, a role for which she received an Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Italian ever to win an Oscar.

Williams recorded it as a demo in 1949 in Nashville and it was released as a posthumous single by MGM Records in 1957. "", ""Hiram 'Hank' Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987).

The voting was also a very close one, Luxembourg won with 129 points, with Spain finishing only 4 points behind and Cliff Richard another 2 points after. David recorded her winning entry in five languages; French, English ('Wonderful Dream'), German (as 'Du bist da'), Spanish ('Te reconocerás') and – very unusually – in two entirely different Italian translations, entitled 'Il letto del reThe King's Bed') and 'Non si vive di pauraYou Can't Live By Fear') respectively.

', ""Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a 1997 film by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. It profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, who is a lion tamer; George Mendonça, who created topiaries at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, including giraffes made out of boxwood; Ray Mendez, a hairless mole-rats expert; and Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. scientist who has designed bug-like robots. The film's musical score is by composer Caleb Sampson, and is performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience. The invention is called the Interrotron. His four subjects narrate the film in their own words. The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'. In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. The film is extensively cut with scenes from older films and television shows. The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover's idol Clyde Beatty appears from portions of his film 'Darkest Africa' and a malicious robot appears in scenes from 'Zombies of the Stratosphere'. After using the first moments in the film to establish his characters one by one, with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another, in order to correlate the themes which the four subjects have in common. The title of the film is a play on the old engineer's adage that out of 'fast,cheap,' and 'reliable,' you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car). Rodney Brooks, the robot scientist from MIT, wrote a paper in which he speculates that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space, instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring. The paper was fully titled 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System', and published in the 'Journal of the British Interplanetary Society' in 1989.

Santiago studied Literature, Philosophy and Music. From 1959-66 he was assistant director to Robert Bresson. In 1969, he made his first feature film 'Invasión' in his native Argentina based on an idea by celebrated writers Adolfo Bioy Casares and Jorge Luis Borges, who also co-wrote the script. Adolfo Bioy Casares described the film in May 1969 as follows:Invasión' modernises the theme of The Iliad: it does not praise the shrewdness and effectiveness of the conqueror, but rather the courage of a handful of warriors ready to defend their Troy-which is far too much like Buenos Aires-where there is always a group of friends and a tango inviting you to fight for just and noble causes. Homer will forgive me: the heart is always on the side of those who resist. I believe Hugo Santiago has created an extraordinary film'.

In 1979 he made 'Écoute voir...' with Catherine Deneuve cast as a female detective investigating a gang looking to control people using radio waves. He returned to Argentina with 'Les Trottoirs de Saturne' a reflection on his own exile in 1986. Prior to his latest feature film, stylish detective thriller 'Le Loup de la côte Ouest' (2002), he directed theatrical adaptations for the screen of Sophocles ('Électre'), Bertolt Brecht ('La Vie de Galilée') and the Opera by Iannis Xenakis ('La Geste gibelline').

416,416,185,"[""Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and extensively studied filmmakers in the history of cinema. Known as 'the Master of Suspense', he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' (1955–1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film 'The Pleasure Garden' (1925). His first successful film,  (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film, 'Blackmail', was the first British . Two of his 1930s thrillers, 'The 39 Steps' (1935) and 'The Lady Vanishes' (1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including 'Rebecca' (1940), 'Foreign Correspondent' (1940), 'Suspicion' (1941), 'Shadow of a Doubt' (1943), and 'Notorious' (1946). 'Rebecca' won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for 'Lifeboat' (1944) and 'Spellbound' (1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The 'Hitchcockian' style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film 'is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.' After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with 'Strangers on a Train' (1951) and 'Dial M For Murder' (1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time: 'Rear Window' (1954), 'Vertigo' (1958), 'North by Northwest' (1959), and 'Psycho' (1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012, 'Vertigo' replaced Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane' (1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite, 'Shadow of a Doubt' (1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died.

', ""Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a 1997 film by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. It profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, who is a lion tamer; George Mendonça, who created topiaries at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, including giraffes made out of boxwood; Ray Mendez, a hairless mole-rats expert; and Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. scientist who has designed bug-like robots. The film's musical score is by composer Caleb Sampson, and is performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience. The invention is called the Interrotron. His four subjects narrate the film in their own words. The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'. In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. The film is extensively cut with scenes from older films and television shows. The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover's idol Clyde Beatty appears from portions of his film 'Darkest Africa' and a malicious robot appears in scenes from 'Zombies of the Stratosphere'. After using the first moments in the film to establish his characters one by one, with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another, in order to correlate the themes which the four subjects have in common. The title of the film is a play on the old engineer's adage that out of 'fast,cheap,' and 'reliable,' you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car). Rodney Brooks, the robot scientist from MIT, wrote a paper in which he speculates that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space, instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring. The paper was fully titled 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System', and published in the 'Journal of the British Interplanetary Society' in 1989.

Nicknamed 'The Brazilian Bombshell', Miranda is noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in her American films. As a young woman, she designed hats in a boutique before making her first recordings with composer Josué de Barros in 1929. Miranda's 1930 recording of 'Taí (Pra Você Gostar de Mim)', written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba. During the 1930s Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian 'chanchadas', films celebrating Brazilian music, dance, and the country's carnival culture. ' Hello, Hello Brazil!' and 'Hello, Hello, Carnival!' embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical 'Banana da Terra' (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her 'Baiana' image, inspired by African-Brazilians from the northeastern state of Bahia. In 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in 'The Streets of Paris' after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, 'Down Argentine Way' with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Lusophone accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's 'The Gang's All Here,' which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States. Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical 'Brazilian Bombshell' image she had cultivated, and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. In 1941 she was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her hand and footprints in the courtyard of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and was the first South American honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

But first, the leader of the Spanish guerrillas (Sinatra) wants to transport the weapon 1,000 km across Spain to help in the recapture of the city of Ávila from the occupying French before he releases it to the British.

He was, therefore, a younger half-brother of King Edward II (1307–1327) and a full brother of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent. He occupied the office of Earl Marshal of England. ', ""Edward I (17/18 June 1239 – 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots , was King of England from 1272 to 1307. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems. Edward I was a tall man (6'2') for his era, hence the nickname 'Longshanks'. He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657.

George thought about it, and finally he told us that he just was n't right for it. We were really despondent over that decision. He was exactly right. He probably would have been terrible. He was a fine producer, but for this job, he was not right for it although we thought he was. ' In Michael Davis ’ 2008 book,' Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street,' Dessart is credited with the suggestion to use a commercial format( e.g., ' Sesame Street is brought to you by the letter ' P ' and the number ' 2 ') to ' sell ' letters and numbers to children. George Dessart was professor emeritus at Brooklyn College and lived in San Francisco, California. "", '\x1b[92m Mohamed Réda Babouche( born July 3, 1979 in Skikda) is an Algerian footballer\x1b[0m.

451,451,185,"[""Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and extensively studied filmmakers in the history of cinema. Known as 'the Master of Suspense', he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' (1955–1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film 'The Pleasure Garden' (1925). His first successful film,  (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film, 'Blackmail', was the first British . Two of his 1930s thrillers, 'The 39 Steps' (1935) and 'The Lady Vanishes' (1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including 'Rebecca' (1940), 'Foreign Correspondent' (1940), 'Suspicion' (1941), 'Shadow of a Doubt' (1943), and 'Notorious' (1946). 'Rebecca' won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for 'Lifeboat' (1944) and 'Spellbound' (1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The 'Hitchcockian' style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film 'is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.' After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with 'Strangers on a Train' (1951) and 'Dial M For Murder' (1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time: 'Rear Window' (1954), 'Vertigo' (1958), 'North by Northwest' (1959), and 'Psycho' (1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012, 'Vertigo' replaced Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane' (1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite, 'Shadow of a Doubt' (1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died. "", ""Rope is a 1948 American psychological crime thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, based on the 1929 play of the same name by Patrick Hamilton. The film was adapted by Hume Cronyn with a screenplay by Arthur Laurents. The film was produced by Hitchcock and Sidney Bernstein as the first of their Transatlantic Pictures productions. Starring James Stewart, John Dall and Farley Granger, this is the first of Hitchcock's Technicolor films, and is notable for taking place in real time and being edited so as to appear as a single shot through the use of long takes. It is the second of Hitchcock's 'limited setting' films, the first being 'Lifeboat'. The original play was said to be inspired by the real-life murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks in 1924 by University of Chicago students Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb.

He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 'Billboard' Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single 'Candle in the Wind 1997', rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, 'Empty Sky', was released. In 1970, his first hit single, 'Your Song', from his second album, 'Elton John', reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for 'The Lion King' and its stage adaptation, 'Aida' and 'Billy Elliot the Musical'. John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, 'Rolling Stone' ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, 'Billboard' ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the 'Billboard' Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for 'services to music and charitable services' in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over £300 million.

Partridge was the son of Edward Partridge, the first Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church, and his wife Lydia. Partridge was born in Independence, Missouri, and was less than a year old when the Latter- day Saints were driven out of that place. The family moved to Clay County, Missouri, then Caldwell County, Missouri, and then to Nauvoo, Illinois, where Partridge's father died when young Edward was about seven. Partridge arrived in Utah in 1848 and then was called on a mission to Hawaii in 1854, where he remained until 1857. In 1858, Partridge married Sarah Lucretia Clayton, a daughter of William Clayton. He later moved to Farmington, Utah, where he ran Amasa M. Lyman's farm there. In 1864, Partridge moved to Fillmore, Utah, where he was called to serve as bishop in the LDS Church. In 1877, he became a counselor to Ira N. Hinckley in the presidency of the Millard Stake which was headquartered in Fillmore. From 1882 to 1885, Partridge served as president of the Hawaiian Mission of the church. Partridge then moved to Provo so his children could study at Brigham Young Academy.

After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems. Edward I was a tall man (6'2') for his era, hence the nickname 'Longshanks'. He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657.

477,477,100,"[""Meriel Forbes, Lady Richardson (13 September 1913 – 7 April 2000) was an English actress. She was a granddaughter of Norman Forbes-Robertson and great-niece of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson. After making her stage debut with her father's touring company in 1929 she progressed via provincial repertory to the West End, where she appeared continually from the 1930s to the 1970s. She married the actor Ralph Richardson in 1944, and the couple regularly appeared together in London, and on tour in the UK, continental Europe, Australia and North and South America. She made her first film in 1934 and made fourteen more films between then and 1969. "", ""Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.

"", ""Ralph Richardson\n\x1b[96m[3] Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor\x1b[0m who, along with his contemporaries Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.

He was, therefore, a younger half-brother of King Edward II (1307–1327) and a full brother of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent. He occupied the office of Earl Marshal of England. ', ""Edward I (17/18 June 1239 – 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots , was King of England from 1272 to 1307. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems. Edward I was a tall man (6'2') for his era, hence the nickname 'Longshanks'. He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657.

But first, the leader of the Spanish guerrillas (Sinatra) wants to transport the weapon 1,000 km across Spain to help in the recapture of the city of Ávila from the occupying French before he releases it to the British.

The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia. Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east.

The empire's capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain.

The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia. Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The empire's capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain. Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga (modern Odisha), which he conquered in about 260 BCE. In about 263 BCE, he converted to Buddhism after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War, which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations. He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia, and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha.

Adolfo Bioy Casares described the film in May 1969 as follows:Invasión' modernises the theme of The Iliad: it does not praise the shrewdness and effectiveness of the conqueror, but rather the courage of a handful of warriors ready to defend their Troy-which is far too much like Buenos Aires-where there is always a group of friends and a tango inviting you to fight for just and noble causes.

511,511,200,"['Womb( retitled Clone for its UK DVD release) is a 2010 science fiction drama film written and directed by Benedek Fliegauf and starring Eva Green and Matt Smith. ', ""Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a 1997 film by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. It profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, who is a lion tamer; George Mendonça, who created topiaries at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, including giraffes made out of boxwood; Ray Mendez, a hairless mole-rats expert; and Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. scientist who has designed bug-like robots. The film's musical score is by composer Caleb Sampson, and is performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience. The invention is called the Interrotron. His four subjects narrate the film in their own words. The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'.

Vicky Leandros had won the 1972 Contest for Luxembourg with 'Après toi' and the 1973 edition was consequently held in the Luxembourgish capital. Performed eleventh on the night – after Italy's Massimo Ranieri with 'Chi sarà con te' and before Sweden's Nova with 'You're Summer' – it was awarded a total of 129 points, placing it first in a field of 17. Spain's 'Eres Tú' performed by Mocedades finished second and Cliff Richard's 'Power to All Our Friends' third, both songs would go on to become major hit singles in 1973 - in the case of 'Eres Tú' worldwide - and are today both widely considered Eurovision classics. The voting was also a very close one, Luxembourg won with 129 points, with Spain finishing only 4 points behind and Cliff Richard another 2 points after. David recorded her winning entry in five languages; French, English ('Wonderful Dream'), German (as 'Du bist da'), Spanish ('Te reconocerás') and – very unusually – in two entirely different Italian translations, entitled 'Il letto del reThe King's Bed') and 'Non si vive di pauraYou Can't Live By Fear') respectively. In 1973 Turkish pop singer Nilüfer Yumlu brought out a Turkish-language version of the song, entitled 'Göreceksin Kendini'. The song had great success in Turkey. The same year, Finnish singer Katri Helena published a Finnish-language version of the song, 'Nuoruus on seikkailuBeing Young is an Adventure'). It was succeeded as Luxembourg's entry in the 1974 Contest by 'Bye Bye , I Love You', performed by Ireen Sheer.

The film co-stars Theodore Bikel and Jay Novello. The film's storyline concerns a British Royal Navy artillery officer (Grant) who has orders to retrieve a huge siege cannon from Spain and transport it by ship to British forces. But first, the leader of the Spanish guerrillas (Sinatra) wants to transport the weapon 1,000 km across Spain to help in the recapture of the city of Ávila from the occupying French before he releases it to the British. Most of the film deals with the hardships of transporting the big gun to Ávila across rivers and through mountains, while also evading the occupying French forces that have been ordered to find it. A subplot concerns the struggle for the love of the Spanish woman Juana (Loren) by the two male protagonists. The screen story and screenplay by Edna Anhalt and Edward Anhalt was loosely based on the 1933 novel 'The Gun' by C. S. Forester. Earl Felton did an uncredited screenplay re-write, George Antheil composed the music score, while Saul Bass designed the opening title sequence.

"", ""Stanley Earl Kramer (September 29, 1913February 19, 2001) was an American film director and producer, responsible for making many of Hollywood's most famous 'message films'. As an independent producer and director, he brought attention to topical social issues that most studios avoided. Among the subjects covered in his films were racism (in 'The Defiant Ones' and 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'), nuclear war (in 'On the Beach'), greed (in 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'), creationism vs. evolution (in 'Inherit the Wind') and the causes and effects of fascism (in 'Judgment at Nuremberg'). His other notable films included 'High Noon' (1952, as producer), 'The Caine Mutiny' (1954, as producer), and 'Ship of Fools' (1965). Director Steven Spielberg described him as an 'incredibly talented visionary', and 'one of our great filmmakers, not just for the art and passion he put on screen, but for the impact he has made on the conscience of the world.' Kramer was recognized for his fierce independence as a producer-director, with author Victor Navasky writing that 'among the independents . . . none seemed more vocal, more liberal, more pugnacious than young Stanley Kramer.' His friend, Kevin Spacey, during his acceptance speech at the 2015 Golden Globes, honored Kramer's work, calling him 'one of the great filmmakers of all time.' Despite uneven critical reception, both then and now, Kramer's body of work has received many awards, including 16 Academy Awards and 80 nominations, and he was nominated nine times as either producer or director. In 1961, he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival.

John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 'Billboard' Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single 'Candle in the Wind 1997', rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, 'Empty Sky', was released. In 1970, his first hit single, 'Your Song', from his second album, 'Elton John', reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for 'The Lion King' and its stage adaptation, 'Aida' and 'Billy Elliot the Musical'. John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, 'Rolling Stone' ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, 'Billboard' ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the 'Billboard' Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for 'services to music and charitable services' in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over £300 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. Presenting John with France's highest civilian award, the Legion d'honneur, in 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called him a 'melodic genius' and praised his work on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2018, John embarked on a three-year farewell tour. "", ""'Sick City' is a 1974 song with music written by Elton John and lyrics by Bernie Taupin.

For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, 'Empty Sky', was released. In 1970, his first hit single, 'Your Song', from his second album, 'Elton John', reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for 'The Lion King' and its stage adaptation, 'Aida' and 'Billy Elliot the Musical'. John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor.

She was a granddaughter of Norman Forbes-Robertson and great-niece of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson. After making her stage debut with her father's touring company in 1929 she progressed via provincial repertory to the West End, where she appeared continually from the 1930s to the 1970s. She married the actor Ralph Richardson in 1944, and the couple regularly appeared together in London, and on tour in the UK, continental Europe, Australia and North and South America. She made her first film in 1934 and made fourteen more films between then and 1969. "", ""Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.

', ""Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a 1997 film by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. It profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, who is a lion tamer; George Mendonça, who created topiaries at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, including giraffes made out of boxwood; Ray Mendez, a hairless mole-rats expert; and Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. scientist who has designed bug-like robots. The film's musical score is by composer Caleb Sampson, and is performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience. The invention is called the Interrotron. His four subjects narrate the film in their own words. The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'. In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. The film is extensively cut with scenes from older films and television shows. The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover's idol Clyde Beatty appears from portions of his film 'Darkest Africa' and a malicious robot appears in scenes from 'Zombies of the Stratosphere'. After using the first moments in the film to establish his characters one by one, with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another, in order to correlate the themes which the four subjects have in common. The title of the film is a play on the old engineer's adage that out of 'fast,cheap,' and 'reliable,' you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car). Rodney Brooks, the robot scientist from MIT, wrote a paper in which he speculates that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space, instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring. The paper was fully titled 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System', and published in the 'Journal of the British Interplanetary Society' in 1989.

It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience. The invention is called the Interrotron. His four subjects narrate the film in their own words. The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'. In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. The film is extensively cut with scenes from older films and television shows. The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover's idol Clyde Beatty appears from portions of his film 'Darkest Africa' and a malicious robot appears in scenes from 'Zombies of the Stratosphere'. After using the first moments in the film to establish his characters one by one, with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another, in order to correlate the themes which the four subjects have in common. The title of the film is a play on the old engineer's adage that out of 'fast,cheap,' and 'reliable,' you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car). Rodney Brooks, the robot scientist from MIT, wrote a paper in which he speculates that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space, instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring. The paper was fully titled 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System', and published in the 'Journal of the British Interplanetary Society' in 1989. The film is available on VHS, DVD; the soundtrack by Caleb Sampson is available on CD.

597,597,185,"[""Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and extensively studied filmmakers in the history of cinema. Known as 'the Master of Suspense', he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' (1955–1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film 'The Pleasure Garden' (1925). His first successful film,  (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film, 'Blackmail', was the first British . Two of his 1930s thrillers, 'The 39 Steps' (1935) and 'The Lady Vanishes' (1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including 'Rebecca' (1940), 'Foreign Correspondent' (1940), 'Suspicion' (1941), 'Shadow of a Doubt' (1943), and 'Notorious' (1946). 'Rebecca' won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for 'Lifeboat' (1944) and 'Spellbound' (1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The 'Hitchcockian' style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film 'is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.' After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with 'Strangers on a Train' (1951) and 'Dial M For Murder' (1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time: 'Rear Window' (1954), 'Vertigo' (1958), 'North by Northwest' (1959), and 'Psycho' (1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012, 'Vertigo' replaced Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane' (1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite, 'Shadow of a Doubt' (1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died.

Known as 'the Master of Suspense', he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' (1955–1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. \x1b[92m Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company\x1b[0m. He made his directorial debut with the silent film 'The Pleasure Garden' (1925). His first successful film,  (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film, 'Blackmail', was the first British . Two of his 1930s thrillers, 'The 39 Steps' (1935) and 'The Lady Vanishes' (1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including 'Rebecca' (1940), 'Foreign Correspondent' (1940), 'Suspicion' (1941), 'Shadow of a Doubt' (1943), and 'Notorious' (1946). 'Rebecca' won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for 'Lifeboat' (1944) and 'Spellbound' (1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The 'Hitchcockian' style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film 'is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.' After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with 'Strangers on a Train' (1951) and 'Dial M For Murder' (1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time: 'Rear Window' (1954), 'Vertigo' (1958), 'North by Northwest' (1959), and 'Psycho' (1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012, 'Vertigo' replaced Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane' (1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite, 'Shadow of a Doubt' (1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died.

Vicky Leandros had won the 1972 Contest for Luxembourg with 'Après toi' and the 1973 edition was consequently held in the Luxembourgish capital. Performed eleventh on the night – after Italy's Massimo Ranieri with 'Chi sarà con te' and before Sweden's Nova with 'You're Summer' – it was awarded a total of 129 points, placing it first in a field of 17. Spain's 'Eres Tú' performed by Mocedades finished second and Cliff Richard's 'Power to All Our Friends' third, both songs would go on to become major hit singles in 1973 - in the case of 'Eres Tú' worldwide - and are today both widely considered Eurovision classics. The voting was also a very close one, Luxembourg won with 129 points, with Spain finishing only 4 points behind and Cliff Richard another 2 points after. David recorded her winning entry in five languages; French, English ('Wonderful Dream'), German (as 'Du bist da'), Spanish ('Te reconocerás') and – very unusually – in two entirely different Italian translations, entitled 'Il letto del reThe King's Bed') and 'Non si vive di pauraYou Can't Live By Fear') respectively. In 1973 Turkish pop singer Nilüfer Yumlu brought out a Turkish-language version of the song, entitled 'Göreceksin Kendini'. The song had great success in Turkey.

He was born in Dookie, Victoria in 1925, and attended Assumption College, Kilmore. He qualified in medicine at the University of Melbourne in 1948. He led the first St Vincent’s Hospital civilian surgical team to work in Long Xuyen, Vietnam, from October 1965 - January 1966. In 1986 he was made Hunterian Professor of Surgery by the Royal College of Surgeons (London) and delivered his oration on diverticular disease. In 1988 he published 'A Very Short Textbook of Surgery' (3rd edition, 1994, Chapman and Hall, London), and this was also translated into Indonesian and Mandarin. He also worked as an honorary consultant surgeon one morning per month for almost 20 years from 1981, at the VAHS (Victorian Aboriginal Health Service). He died from cancer on 3 June 2002. Ryan was President of the International Society of University Colon and Rectal Surgeons from 1986 to 1988 and colorectal cancer was a major medical study of his professional life. Ryan chaired the ISUCRS's Congress in Melbourne in 1980. Another of his medical lifetime interests was road safety and driving. He was a founding member of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons' Road Trauma Committee, which was partially responsible for the introduction of compulsory seat belts in cars in Victoria, in 1970, the first state in the world to pass such a law (Seat belt legislation). In May 1965 Ryan supported a motion to investigate the causes of road accidents in Australia. In 1996 the Peter Ryan Prize for Surgical Research for final year St Vincent’s medical students was established in his honour.

643,643,156,"[""Carmen Miranda (born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha; February 9, 1909 – August 5, 1955), was a Portuguese-born Brazilian samba singer, dancer, Broadway actress, and film star who was popular from the 1930s to the 1950s. Nicknamed 'The Brazilian Bombshell', Miranda is noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in her American films. As a young woman, she designed hats in a boutique before making her first recordings with composer Josué de Barros in 1929. Miranda's 1930 recording of 'Taí (Pra Você Gostar de Mim)', written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba. During the 1930s Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian 'chanchadas', films celebrating Brazilian music, dance, and the country's carnival culture. ' Hello, Hello Brazil!' and 'Hello, Hello, Carnival!' embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical 'Banana da Terra' (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her 'Baiana' image, inspired by African-Brazilians from the northeastern state of Bahia. In 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in 'The Streets of Paris' after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, 'Down Argentine Way' with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Lusophone accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's 'The Gang's All Here,' which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States. Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical 'Brazilian Bombshell' image she had cultivated, and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture.

Nicknamed 'The Brazilian Bombshell', Miranda is noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in her American films. As a young woman, she designed hats in a boutique before making her first recordings with composer Josué de Barros in 1929. Miranda's 1930 recording of 'Taí (Pra Você Gostar de Mim)', written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba. During the 1930s Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian 'chanchadas', films celebrating Brazilian music, dance, and the country's carnival culture. ' Hello, Hello Brazil!' and 'Hello, Hello, Carnival!' embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical 'Banana da Terra' (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her 'Baiana' image, inspired by African-Brazilians from the northeastern state of Bahia. In 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in 'The Streets of Paris' after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, 'Down Argentine Way' with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Lusophone accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's 'The Gang's All Here,' which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States. Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical 'Brazilian Bombshell' image she had cultivated, and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture.
