The Acts sought to protect British merchants and creditors from being paid in depreciated colonial currency. The policy created tension between the colonies and Great Britain and was cited as a grievance by colonists early in the American Revolution. However, the consensus view among modern economic historians and economists is that the debts by colonists to British merchants were not a major cause of the Revolution. In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that 92% of economists and 74% of historians disagreed with the statement, 'The debts owed by colonists to British merchants and other private citizens constituted one of the most powerful causes leading to the Revolution.' Economic climate of the colonies "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_Act\n\x1b[96m[2] The first Act, the Currency Act 1751 (24 Geo\x1b[0m. \x1b[96m[3] 2. c. 53), restricted the issue of paper money and the establishment of new public banks by the colonies of New England\x1b[0m. These colonies had issued paper fiat money known as 'bills of credit' to help pay for military expenses during the French and Indian Wars. Because more paper money was issued than what was taxed out of circulation, the currency depreciated in relation to the British pound sterling. The resultant inflation was harmful to merchants in Great Britain, who were forced to accept the depreciated currency from colonists for payment of debts. The Act limited the future issue of bills of credit to certain circumstances. It allowed the existing bills to be used as legal tender for public debts (i.e. paying taxes), but did not allow their use for private debts (e.g. for paying merchants). Act of 1764 "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_Act\n\x1b[95m[4] The Currency Act 1764 (4 Geo\x1b[0m. \x1b[95m[5] 3. c. 34) extended the 1751 Act to all of the British colonies of North America\x1b[0m. Unlike the earlier Act, this statute did not prohibit the colonies from issuing paper money, but it did forbid them from designating future currency issues as legal tender for public and private debts. This tight money policy created financial difficulties in the colonies, where gold and silver were in short supply. \x1b[95m[6] Benjamin Franklin, a colonial agent in London, lobbied for repeal of the Act over the next several years, as did other agents\x1b[0m. The act arose when Virginia farmers continued to import during the French and Indian War. Virginia issued £250,000 in bills of credit to finance both public and private debts. This legislation differed from the 1751 act in that it prohibited the colonists from designating paper currency for use as payment for any debts, public or private. Parliament did not, however, prohibit the colonists from issuing paper money. The Act was put into place as a hedge against risks associated with economic fluctuations and uncertainty.

The official (not a Government official) who wrote 'This document is forwarded herewith for the favour of your utilisation' might have written 'please use this form'. That says what needed to be said in four syllables instead of 21. Gowers, 1954 "", 'https://www.effortmark.co.uk/why-plain-language-and-plain-english-are-different/\nPlain language relies on testing with users. If the intended users can use the content to do what they need to do, it’s plain. If they can’t, it’s not plain. So you can only really know whether you have succeeded in writing in plain language when you have tested with the actual users. Plain language is much more flexible. For example, in Plain English there are lists of forbidden words. But in plain language, we accept that it’s OK to use the words that these users are familiar with. For example, when I’m writing for farmers about farm animals such as cows and pigs, I choose the word ‘livestock’ because that’s the one that farmers use. Be careful when you search and link Does it matter whether we talk about ‘Plain English’ or ‘plain language’? Not really: when talking to users, either is fine. ', ""https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html\nBut in the last few years, many of these offenders have started to put things right, either rewriting their documents clearly or training their staff in the art of plain English, or both. The main advantages of plain English are: \x1b[95m[3] it is faster to write; it is faster to read; and you get your message across more often, more easily and in a friendlier way\x1b[0m. If you spend more than an hour a day writing, you are to an extent a professional writer. So it's vital that you get it right. So what is plain English? It is a message, written with the reader in mind and with the right tone of voice, that is clear and concise. Keep your sentences short Most experts would agree that clear writing should have an average sentence length of 15 to 20 words.

Prior to 1984, the legal age when alcohol could be purchased in America varied from state to state. \x1b[92m[0] According to the CDC, after all states uniformly increased the legal drinking age to 21, they consequently saw a 16% median decline in motor vehicle crashes.After the enactment of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, states also saw a decrease in the binge drinking behavior of Americans under the age of 25.\x1b[0m Drinking during the previous month declined from 59% in 1985 to 40% in 1991 among Americans aged 18 to 20 years old. Drinking among people aged 21 to 25 declined from 70% in 1985 to 56% in 1991, the CDC reports. And according to the World Health Organization, those who avoid alcohol at a younger age are less likely to develop drinking problems later in life.In the decades since 1991, however, America has seen several problematic trends emerge in the drinking culture of its youth. For example, while men have traditionally shown higher rates of binge drinking than women, that gender gap is now narrowing. Research shows the rates of alcohol use and binge drinking are now on the rise in women and girls.

"", 'https://screenrant.com/disney-lion-king-scar-chose-3-worst-hyenas/\n\x1b[92m[8] The names of the Lion King’s three most notable hyenas are Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, with Shenzi being the most intelligent of the three, followed by Banzai (though he has a vicious appetite and lack of true loyalty that makes him dangerous), and finally Ed, who’s arguably more of a liability than an asset.\x1b[0m The three were introduced in the Lion King as Scar’s secret henchman during Mufasa’s reign, and Scar used them to orchestrate Mufasa’s death in a way that made Simba think it was his fault before ordering them to do the final bit of dirty work for him and kill Simba (which, again, they failed to do). After that, Scar made them his lieutenants when he took over Pride Rock as king, and invited the rest of the hyenas to leave the Elephant Graveyard and join together with the lions in a position of authority. Until Simba came back and reclaimed his rightful place as king, the hyenas had it pretty good. As it turns out, their relatively good fortune under Scar was all thanks to the hyena’s original queen, who initially allowed Scar to recruit three of her subjects for his power-hungry plot. More specifically, she allowed Scar to recruit the three hyenas who were the most expendable. ', ""https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai,_and_Ed\n\x1b[92m[7] The three hyenas made occasional appearances in the TV series The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa.\x1b[0m While Jim Cummings reprised his role as Ed, Tress MacNeille and Rob Paulsen replaced Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as Shenzi and Banzai. While still as vicious and threatening as they are in the movie, the hyenas become more neutral as the show progresses. Though they are at first shown to be more dim-witted in comparison to the original film, they become wiser near the end of their first appearance and in later episodes, often coming up with clever ways to get their meal, though many of them end in failure. The hyenas have their own segments titled 'The Laughing Hyenas', which involve the trio searching for food after running away from the Pride Lands. Outside of their own segments, they appeared in flashbacks in 'Doubt of Africa' and 'Once Upon a Timon' and made a non-speaking appearance in 'Space Ham'. "", ""https://thelionkingstimonandpumbaa.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed\n\x1b[92m[9] His name means 'skulk' or 'lurk' in Swahili.\x1b[0m It can also mean 'die with honor' or 'ten thousand years' in Japanese, possibly a reference to his aggressive nature but more likely coincidental. His most distinguishing feature is his unusually heavy eyebrows. Apart from these, he is the model for most generic hyenas. He is the greediest of the three, frequently making references to being hungry, and asking for food. He also usually speaks and acts without thinking, losing his temper with Ed twice, and complaining when the Pride Lands lacks food under Scar's rule ('It's dinnertime, and we ain't got no stinkin' entrees!'). He even quietly remarks to his friends that Mufasa was a better king than Scar. In addition, when about to commence the Wildebeest Stampede, he almost tried to kill and eat a sick Wildebeest before Scar gave them the signal, but was stopped by Shenzi, reminding him about waiting for Scar's signal. "", ""https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai,_and_Ed\nBanzai seems to have bad luck and tends to take the injuries. His buttocks are severely lacerated by Mufasa's sharp claws, causing him great pain when he sits ('I won't be able to sit for a week!'). In 'Be Prepared', Banzai is fired out of a geyser and handled roughly by Scar. Then when he and the others chase Simba out of the Pride Lands, Banzai is knocked into the thorns and ends up with many in his body. \x1b[92m[4] Ed (voiced by Jim Cummings) is the only hyena without a Swahili name, though there exists in English the word eddy meaning whirlpool.\x1b[0m Ed's distinguishing features are two round cuts on each ear, his tongue often lolls from his mouth and he doesn't have eyebrows. \x1b[92m[10] He doesn't speak and instead communicates through laughter, which he also seems to have difficulty holding back.\x1b[0m Jim Cummings recorded over four hours of various laughter clips for any situation Ed might be in; excited, amused, angry, etc. ""]",what is the name of the hyena in lion king,"The name of the hyena in ""The Lion King"" is Ed [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m[92m[8][0m[92m[9][0m.

February, 2015 In 1980, California passed a series of laws '…\x1b[96m[1] with the intent and purpose to protect children from abuse and neglect.'\x1b[0m \x1b[96m[2] This is the Child Abuse and Reporting Act, otherwise known as the CANRA laws\x1b[0m. Since 1980, the CANRA laws have been amended throughout the years to keep up with advancing technology, recognizing additional appropriate mandated reporters, and to clarify areas of weakness. In 2014, AB 1775 (Melendez) was signed in California, which amended the current definition of 'sexual exploitation1' for the purposes of mandated reporting2. The intent of this amendment was to modernize this section of the CANRA laws in light of the Internet era and to provide greater clarity to mandated reporters.

However, feelings for Maharishi shifted a year later when the band recorded a ‘diss track’ titled Sexy Sadie in which John Lennon accuses Maharishi of breaking 'the rules' and making 'a fool of everyone' who loves him. This followed an alleged inappropriate advance on actress Mia Farrow by Maharishi.

When working with more than one event, you have to be concerned as to whether the first event affects the second event. When determining if events are independent, you are determining if the events are affecting one another. \x1b[92m[6] Independent Events Two events are said to be independent if the result of the second event is not affected by the result of the first event.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] The probability of one event does not change the probability of the other event.\x1b[0m If A and B are independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events. If A and B are independent events, "", 'https://www.cuemath.com/data/independent-events/\nIf the probability of events A and B is P(A) and P(B) respectively, then the two events are independent if any of the following are true: P(A|B)=P(A), P(B|A)=P(B) and P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B) How Do You Tell if an Event Is Independent or Dependent? \x1b[92m[0] Two events A and B are said to be independent if the fact that one event has occurred does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other.\x1b[0m Also if the occurrence of one event affects the probability of occurrence of the other event, then the two events are said to be dependent. Can an Event Be Mutually Exclusive and Independent Event? Mutually exclusive in math are a set of events that cannot happen at the same time. For example: when tossing a coin, the result can either be heads or tails but cannot be both. This of course means mutually exclusive events are not independent, and independent events cannot be mutually exclusive. Are Independent Events Disjoint? ', 'https://byjus.com/maths/independent-events/\nIndependent events are those events whose occurrence is not dependent on any other event. For example, if we flip a coin in the air and get the outcome as Head, then again if we flip the coin but this time we get the outcome as Tail. In both cases, the occurrence of both events is independent of each other. It is one of the types of events in probability. Let us learn here the complete definition of independent events along with its Venn diagram, examples and how it is different from mutually exclusive events. What are Independent Events? In Probability, the set of outcomes of an experiment is called events. There are different types of events such as independent events, dependent events, mutually exclusive events, and so on. \x1b[92m[2] If the probability of occurrence of an event A is not affected by the occurrence of another event B, then A and B are said to be independent events.\x1b[0m ', ""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conditional_probability.asp\n\x1b[92m[1] Two events are said to be independent if one event occurring does not affect the probability that the other event will occur.\x1b[0m However, if one event occurring (or not occurring) does affect the likelihood that the other event will happen, the two events are said to be dependent. An example of dependent events is a company's stock price increasing after the company reports higher-than-expected earnings. If events are independent, then the probability of event B occurring is not contingent on what happens with event A. For example, an increase in Apple's shares has nothing to do with a drop in wheat prices. Conditional probability is often written as the 'probability of A given B' and notated as P(A|B).

The play is one of a triad of tragedies known as the three Theban plays, following Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus. \x1b[92m[1] Even though the events in Antigone occur last in the order of events depicted in the plays, Sophocles wrote Antigone first.\x1b[0m The story expands on the Theban legend that predates it, and it picks up where Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes ends. The play is named after the main protagonist Antigone. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles\n\x1b[92m[4] Sophocles[a] (c. 497/496 – winter 406/405 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, known as one of three from whom at least one play has survived in full.\x1b[0m His first plays were written later than, or contemporary with, those of Aeschylus; and earlier than, or contemporary with, those of Euripides. \x1b[92m[2] Sophocles wrote over 120 plays, but only seven have survived in a complete form: Ajax, Antigone, Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra, Philoctetes, and Oedipus at Colonus.\x1b[0m For almost fifty years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens which took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. He competed in thirty competitions, won twenty-four, and was never judged lower than second place. Aeschylus won thirteen competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles; Euripides won four. ', 'https://femminaclassica.com/analyzing-antigone/\nTo begin to understand the psyche of Antigone, it is important to get a grasp from whence she came. Because mythology was ubiquitous to the ancient Greeks, the audience would have been all too familiar with Oedipus’s woeful tale and the cursed Laius family. Frequently performed in mythological sequence, Sophocles’ Theban saga—-Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone—- was written out of sequence and therefore not considered a trilogy in the manner of Aeschylus’ Oresteia. Each play of the Theban saga is a unit unto itself. \x1b[92m[3] Although the events in Antigone come last in the saga, in actuality, Sophocles wrote Antigone first (in about 442 BCE), preceding Oedipus the King by about twelve years.\x1b[0m Thus, the Creon in Antigone has an altogether different persona than the Creon in Oedipus the King.

Draft hopefuls are looking to increase their respective draft stocks. The workouts test any number of physical qualities, but the most anticipated is arguably the 40-yard dash. Whether it is Rich Eisen running the 40-yard dash to raise money for St. Jude Children’s Hospital or near 400-pound linemen doing their best sprints, it is an entertaining event. Sometimes, when you see a player get off the line and make their way down the field, you can just tell they are flying. Players are getting faster and stronger, making the 40-yard dash must-see TV. Participants this season will look to turn heads by setting the fastest 40-time possible, with a chance at history. \x1b[92m[0] The fastest 40-yard dash recorded at the Combine belongs to wide receiver John Ross, who ran an insane 4.22 at the 2017 Combine.\x1b[0m It was a weaker wide receiver class, but you have to assume that his deep-threat ability is what influenced the Cincinnati Bengals to draft him as No. 9 overall. Speed doesn’t automatically guarantee a high draft pick, as cornerback Kalon Barnes found out. Despite his 4.23-second 40-yard dash in 2023, Barnes was a seventh-round pick in 2022. He has bounced around practice squads over his brief two-year career, most recently signing a reserve/futures contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers. East Carolina running back Chris Johnson held the 40-yard dash record for 11 years before Ross broke it in 2017.

There are 365 days in most calendar years, but in the time it takes for the Earth to go around the sun once, our planet actually spins 365 and nearly a quarter times. \x1b[92m[1] The reason we care about that extra quarter is because the Earth has seasons\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] To know when to plant and harvest your crops it’s nice to have a calendar where spring always starts in March and the longest day of the year is in June and the shortest day is in December\x1b[0m. '\x1b[92m[3] In order to have that consistency in the seasons from year to year, we have to periodically make a correction [to the calendar]\x1b[0m.' Because there’s that extra quarter of a day in the year, it means we have to reset our calendar periodically. Otherwise, start dates of seasons would gradually drift by a quarter of a day every year. After 40 years, we’d be 10 days off. So the start of the season would be 10 days different than it would be 40 years before. After hundreds of years, summer could be starting in November. So in order to have that consistency in the seasons from year to year, we have to periodically make a correction. \x1b[92m[4] A Leap Year happens every four years except for when it doesn’t\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] We add a leap day every four years except if it is a year that is divisible by 100 unless it happens to also be divisible by 400\x1b[0m. Did I confuse you enough with that formula? "", ""https://www.ucf.edu/news/why-is-leap-year-a-thing/\nLeap Year doesn’t necessarily have to occur in February. Our collection of months is very peculiar. If we have a calendar that’s based on a 7-day week, there are 52 weeks plus one day in 365 days. Theoretically, you could have 13 months of 28 days and then have one loaner day — say New Year’s Day — that isn’t in a month.

A portion of the energy obtained by the electron is utilised by the electrons to work against the metal's surface forces. The work function of the photo metal is represented by this portion of the energy.Suggest Corrections2Similar questionsQ.

When Howe arrived in Washington, FDR gave him his handwritten draft of the speech. Howe made his own changes and additions and had a secretary type a new draft.

In medical terms, the word 'pulmonary' means something that affects your lungs.You have one main pulmonary artery, also known as your pulmonary trunk. \x1b[92m[1] This artery directly connects with your heart at your pulmonary valve. This is the 'door' that controls blood flow out of your lower right heart chamber (right\x1b[0m ventricle). After leaving your heart, your main pulmonary artery divides into your right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery. Your right and left pulmonary arteries lead to your right lung and left lung, respectively.You may hear your healthcare provider call your pulmonary artery a 'great vessel.'

This 'stand your ground law' has been used in numerous high-profile court cases. Many of the citizens of Alabama feel the law is fair. Still, critics often argue that it gives you far too much leeway to utilize deadly force and that it may disproportionately affect minorities. The law’s proponents say it is a necessary and soundly based legal tool for self-defense and is applied justly in most cases. The 'stand your ground' law in Alabama, in many ways, transformed the legal approach in self-defense cases. For example, if you believe you are in imminent threat of severe bodily harm or death, you should be able to use deadly or physical force in your defense. "", ""https://giffords.org/lawcenter/state-laws/stand-your-ground-in-alabama/\nSelf-defense laws in the US typically justify a person’s use of lethal force in public in situations where lethal force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or another person. Traditionally, these laws have been clear that taking human life is not necessary, and is therefore not justified, if the person could have avoided using lethal violence by retreating, or simply stepping away from a confrontation. A person does not have a duty to retreat from a conflict before using force in their home, however (known as the Castle Doctrine).1 Stand your ground laws upend centuries of legal tradition, allowing a person to use deadly force in self-defense in public, even if that force can be safely avoided by retreating or when nonlethal force would suffice. \x1b[92m[1] Alabama LawAlabama has adopted a stand your ground statute that removes the duty to retreat before using deadly force 'in any place where [a person] has the right to be.\x1b[0m'2MEDIA REQUESTSOur experts can speak to the full spectrum of gun violence prevention issues.

According to German alphabetical sorting, people with von in their surnames – of noble or non-noble descent alike – are listed in telephone books and other files under the rest of their names (e.g., the economist Ludwig von Mises would have been found under M in the phone book rather than V). In Austria, in contrast, not only were the privileges of the nobility abolished, their titles and prepositions were abolished as well in 1919. Thus, for example, Friedrich von Hayek became simply Friedrich Hayek. (See also Austrian nobility on this issue.)

Article III, Section I states that '\x1b[92m[1] The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish\x1b[0m.' Although the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court, it permits Congress to decide how to organize it. Congress first exercised this power in the Judiciary Act of 1789. This Act created a Supreme Court with six justices. It also established the lower federal court system. The Justices Over the years, various Acts of Congress have altered the number of seats on the Supreme Court, from a low of five to a high of 10. Shortly after the Civil War, the number of seats on the Court was fixed at nine. Today, there is one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Like all federal judges, justices are appointed by the President and are confirmed by the Senate. They, typically, hold office for life. The salaries of the justices cannot be decreased during their term of office. These restrictions are meant to protect the independence of the judiciary from the political branches of government. The Court's Jurisdiction Article III, Section II of the Constitution establishes the jurisdiction (legal ability to hear a case) of the Supreme Court. \x1b[92m[2] The Court has original jurisdiction (a case is tried before the Court) over certain cases, e.g., suits between two or more states and/or cases involving ambassadors and other public ministers\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] The Court has appellate jurisdiction (the Court can hear the case on appeal) on almost any other case that involves a point of constitutional and/or federal law\x1b[0m.

Released as a single two months after the film's premiere, it became a worldwide hit, reaching the Top 10 in several countries. The song became one of Dylan's most popular and most covered post-1960s compositions, spawning covers from Eric Clapton, Guns N' Roses, Randy Crawford, and more. Described by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin as 'an exercise in splendid simplicity', the song features two short verses, the lyrics of which comment directly on the scene in the film for which it was written: the death of a frontier lawman (Slim Pickens) who refers to his wife (Katy Jurado) as 'Mama'. It was ranked number 190 in 2004 by Rolling Stone magazine, in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and number 192 in 2010. Musicians Bob Dylan: vocals, guitar In January 1975 Eric Clapton played on Arthur Louis's recording of 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' which was arranged in a cross-over reggae style. After the recording sessions with Louis, Clapton recorded his own version of the song which was released as a single in August 1975 two weeks after Louis's version. This version was released on Timepieces: The Best of Eric Clapton. Clapton's version made it to No. 38 on the UK charts, but the single was less successful in the U.S. where it failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 (although it reached on No. 109 on Cashbox's Looking Ahead chart). Clapton's 1996 boxed set Crossroads 2: Live in the Seventies features a performance of the song recorded in London in April 1977. There were also performances of the song included on the Journeyman (1990) and the One More Car, One More Rider (2003) world tours. Several Clapton compilation albums also feature the song.

The star of multiple teen comedies in the '90s like American Pie, But I'm a Cheerleader, and Detroit Rock City, her career was unfortunately overshadowed by her addiction issues and brushes with the law, even though she worked steadily for several years. Lyonne was arrested for a DUI in 2001, and in 2005, she was admitted to the intensive-care unit of a New York hospital for a variety of ailments, including a collapsed lung and hepatitis C due to her drug use. She told EW in 2012, 'I was definitely as good as dead, you know? A lot of people don't come back.' She displayed her heart surgery scar in OITNB, where her addict character Nicky cited the same reason. Once she got cast (as well as Emmy-nominated) in OITNB, Lyonne appears to have found salvation in working as hard as she possibly can, capitalizing on her charismatic, raspy-voiced, laid-back persona. Lyonne co-created and stars in the award-winning time-loop Netflix series Russian Doll. She followed up that triumph with her portrayal of Charlie Cale, the Columbo-inspired accidental detective of Poker Face, the Peacock series created by Knives Out director Rian Johnson. You can also hear her signature vocals in animated projects like Big Mouth and DC League of Super-Pets. Lyonne recently split from long-time partner Fred Armisen, but judging from his appearance at her recent hosting debut on Saturday Night Live, the split looks pretty amicable. 05 of 18 Danielle Brooks (Taystee Jefferson) JOJO WHILDEN/Netflix; Arturo Holmes/Getty "", ""(Ali Goldstein/Netflix) The hit Netflix series 'Orange is the New Black' is back for a second season.

The star of multiple teen comedies in the '90s like American Pie, But I'm a Cheerleader, and Detroit Rock City, her career was unfortunately overshadowed by her addiction issues and brushes with the law, even though she worked steadily for several years. Lyonne was arrested for a DUI in 2001, and in 2005, she was admitted to the intensive-care unit of a New York hospital for a variety of ailments, including a collapsed lung and hepatitis C due to her drug use. She told EW in 2012, 'I was definitely as good as dead, you know? A lot of people don't come back.' She displayed her heart surgery scar in OITNB, where her addict character Nicky cited the same reason. Once she got cast (as well as Emmy-nominated) in OITNB, Lyonne appears to have found salvation in working as hard as she possibly can, capitalizing on her charismatic, raspy-voiced, laid-back persona. Lyonne co-created and stars in the award-winning time-loop Netflix series Russian Doll. She followed up that triumph with her portrayal of Charlie Cale, the Columbo-inspired accidental detective of Poker Face, the Peacock series created by Knives Out director Rian Johnson. You can also hear her signature vocals in animated projects like Big Mouth and DC League of Super-Pets. Lyonne recently split from long-time partner Fred Armisen, but judging from his appearance at her recent hosting debut on Saturday Night Live, the split looks pretty amicable. 05 of 18 Danielle Brooks (Taystee Jefferson) JOJO WHILDEN/Netflix; Arturo Holmes/Getty "", ""https://laist.com/shows/take-two/orange-is-the-new-black-star-kate-mulgrew-on-the-feisty-spirit-of-red\n(Ali Goldstein/Netflix) The hit Netflix series 'Orange is the New Black' is back for a second season. \x1b[96m[1] Actress Kate Mulgrew stars in the show as a feisty Russian inmate named 'Red.'\x1b[0m The second season of Orange is the New Black kicks off on Netflix on June 6. The wildly popular show is based on Piper Kerman's memoir of the time she spent in federal prison on drug related charges. When it first came out in 2013, few guessed that a show set in a drab prison would become such a critical hit, but indeed it has. 'Orange is the New Black' became Netflix's most watched original series, beating out both 'Arrested Development' and 'House of Cards.'

Red Dead Redemption is one of the first games by Rockstar to use an original score. Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich has cited the large scale of the game as one of the largest difficulties when producing the score. He said that, in order to achieve an effective gaming experience, the game could not solely feature licensed music, like previous Rockstar games. 'We figured we'd need to write an original score,' Pavlovich said. To work on the score, Rockstar engaged Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, member and former member of Friends of Dean Martinez, respectively. In collaboration with each other, the duo composed over fourteen hours of music, which scores the game's missions, across fifteen months. The original score and subsequent album were both recorded and mixed at Jackson's personal recording studio in Los Angeles, and mastered at Capitol Studios. Following the recording, Irish producer and composer David Holmes listened to the original score, and subsequently spent three weeks compiling fifteen instrumental tracks that could be used as standalone songs for the game's official soundtrack.

Two years later, in 1824, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (which became the Royal SPCA in 1840) was established. The society focused especially on enforcement of the law, with prosecutions where appropriate.

The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who stars alongside debutant Gracy Singh and British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne. Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of British colonial rule in India, the film follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory.

For example, in desert areas the ratio of dry to wet deposition is higher than an area that receives several inches of rain each year. Measuring Acid Rain Acidity and alkalinity are measured using a pH scale for which 7.0 is neutral. The lower a substance's pH (less than 7), the more acidic it is; the higher a substance's pH (greater than 7), the more alkaline it is. Normal rain has a pH of about 5.6; it is slightly acidic because carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolves into it forming weak carbonic acid.  Acid rain usually has a pH between 4.2 and 4.4. Policymakers, research scientists, ecologists, and modelers rely on the National Atmospheric Deposition Program’s (NADP) National Trends Network (NTN) for measurements of wet deposition. The NADP/NTN collects acid rain at more than 250 monitoring sites throughout the US, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii and the US Virgin Islands. Unlike wet deposition, dry deposition is difficult and expensive to measure. Dry deposition estimates for nitrogen and sulfur pollutants are provided by the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET). Air concentrations are measured by CASTNET at more than 90 locations.

Thankfully, over the years, numerous amendments have expanded the definition of child abuse and the persons required to report the activity.

Combined with the available government support being haphazard at best (e.g., in the early 1960's, California had no county system of child protective services), child protection provided by the government was mostly inaccessible.But the groundwork was laid for the modern form of CPS.Everything Changed in the 60s\x1b[92m[2] During the 1960s, physicians began playing a vital role in increasing the awareness of child abuse once medical schools started providing the necessary\x1b[0m training.

Intoxicated by Color – 1912 Let's go back to twenty years earlier when two MIT friends: Herbert Kalmus and Daniel Comstock teamed up with mechanical engineering prodigy, W. Burton Westcott to form an industrial research and development firm in 1912, called KCW. From the start, film was clearly part of their destiny as the firm was hired to analyze an inventor's flicker-free motion picture system. They became fascinated with the nascent color motion picture processes. \x1b[92m[1] Their zeal led to the incorporation of Technicolor in 1915, and the world of cinema would eventually see color raining down on the screen.\x1b[0m Since 1899 dozens of inventors and companies worldwide had been trying to capture the rainbow, but had failed or were stuck.

197,197,197,392,[True],"[""https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/why-do-we-say-spill-the-beans-and-other-expressions-exploring-the-origins\nThis expression paints a vivid picture of an issue as large and unmissable as an elephant that, paradoxically, everyone decides to ignore. The origin of the saying is quite intriguing. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase was first recorded in 1959, appearing in The New York Times. This initial usage marks the beginning of the phrase's integration into modern language. On June 20, 1959, the publication noted that 'financing schools has become a problem about equal to having an elephant in the living room. It’s so big you just can’t ignore it.' However, the concept dates back much further. In 1814, Russian writer Ivan Krylov penned 'The Inquisitive Man,' a tale about a character who visits a museum and, notably, fails to acknowledge the presence of an elephant presumably within the room.  Discovering the roots of 'spill the beans' 'Spill the beans' is another intriguing expression commonly used when someone reveals a secret. Historians suggest this idiom might have originated from an ancient Greek voting method where beans were used to cast votes.  Spilling the beans prematurely could inadvertently reveal the election's outcome. Today, spilling the beans metaphorically signifies letting out secret information, often causing disruptions or surprises. Understanding 'kick the bucket' 'kick the bucket' is a colloquial way to refer to someone's death. There are multiple theories about its origin, but one popular explanation links it to the old method of slaughtering pigs. A bucket was placed under the pig, which it would kick during the butchering process.  Over time, 'kick the bucket' evolved into a euphemism for death, illustrating the phrase's grim historical context. \x1b[92m[0] Unraveling the history of 'go cold turkey' The phrase 'go cold turkey' originated in the early 20th century, initially used to describe blunt speaking but soon evolved to mean abruptly quitting addictive behaviors, possibly inspired by the cold, clammy skin and goosebumps resembling turkey skin seen in withdrawal.\x1b[0m  First recorded in 1921 in British Columbia’s Daily Colonist as describing straightforward cessation of vices for medical treatment, its frequent media usage during the 1920s helped solidify its current meaning.

It is the opening track on their fourth studio album, Elephant (2003). V2 Records released the song to American alternative radio on February 17, 2003, as the lead single from the album. Worldwide, the single was issued through XL Recordings. Written and produced by Jack White, the song consists of distorted vocals, a simple drumbeat, and a bass line created by playing a guitar through a pitch shift effect. The song charted in multiple countries, and its success contributed to the popularity of the White Stripes and the garage rock revival movement. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise being given to its distinctive riff and drumbeat; various critics and magazines have since listed 'Seven Nation Army' as one of the best songs of all time. It won Best Rock Song at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, and a music video for the song directed by Alex and Martin won Best Editing in a Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2021, Rolling Stone ranked 'Seven Nation Army' 36th on its list of the '500 Greatest Songs of All Time'. 'Seven Nation Army' began with a guitar riff devised by singer and guitarist Jack White at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne, while the White Stripes were on the Australian leg of their tour in January 2002. He showed the riff to Ben Swank, an executive with the White Stripes' record label Third Man, who felt White could 'do better'. White later recalled that Swank 'didn't even think that rhythm was that great, either'. Originally saving the riff for a potential James Bond theme, he decided to incorporate it into a White Stripes song after admitting how slim his chances were of ever being asked to create a Bond theme.

In 1996 and with the consent of Dylan, Scottish musician Ted Christopher wrote a new verse for 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' in memory of the schoolchildren and teacher killed in the Dunblane school massacre. This has been, according to some sources, one of the few times Dylan has officially authorized anybody to add or change the lyrics to one of his songs.This version of the song, including children from the village singing the chorus with guitarist and producer of Dylan's album Infidels (1983), Mark Knopfler, was released on December 9 in the UK and reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The proceeds went to charities for children.

This appeared on the cover of his eponymous first album, recorded at Columbia Records’ New York studios in November 1961. \x1b[92m[9] Bob Dylan wrote Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door for the 1973 movie Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\x1b[0m  The song appears in the scene where a frontier sheriff, played by Slim Pickens, is dying.  He refers to his wife, played by Katy Jurado, as 'Mama.' The version of this song that was used in the movie was specifically orchestrated for that film.  After the release of the movie, the song was re-recorded as a single record.  That version featured Roger McGuinn on guitar, Jim Keltner on drums, Booker T. Jones on bass, and Carl Fortina on harmonium. Bob Dylan was famous for songs with rather cryptic lyrics; however, Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door was an exercise in extreme simplicity. There are just two verses and a repetitive chorus.

The song became one of Dylan's most popular and most covered post-1960s compositions, spawning covers from Eric Clapton, Guns N' Roses, Randy Crawford, and more. Described by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin as 'an exercise in splendid simplicity', the song features two short verses, the lyrics of which comment directly on the scene in the film for which it was written: the death of a frontier lawman (Slim Pickens) who refers to his wife (Katy Jurado) as 'Mama'. It was ranked number 190 in 2004 by Rolling Stone magazine, in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and number 192 in 2010.

At the time, it mainly became known for Bob’s hit, Knocking In Heaven’s Door.Amazingly, another tune (Wagon Wheel) was half recorded during this time but scrapped by Bob who can be heard mumbling the chorus on a bootleg recording. Later finished by Ketch Secor (2004) who wrote the verses, it became a huge hit in the hands of Nathan Carter (2012) and Darius Rucker (2013).

Eric reprises the reggae-style version of this tune, just as with Arthur Louis.  The steady-rocking reggae beat works very well with Eric’s stately and impressive licks on his Fender Stratocaster guitar. By the way, one of Eric Clapton’s favorite Fender Stratocaster guitars was auctioned off in May 2021.  Here is a photo of that guitar.

A lot of these ideas did not come through in the original release cut, the studio used some six editors to hack Peckinpah’s movie to pieces. But, Thankfully, Peckinpah had his original director’s cut in his possession, which he kept hidden from the studio. That became the basis for the 115 minutes director’s cut that was released on home video almost 3 decades later, and it resurrected much of the film’s greatness. \x1b[92m[7] Anyway, despite the film being a box office flop on its release, Bob Dylan’s soundtrack was a superhit, with ‘Knockin’ on heaven’s Door‘ becoming a worldwide success.\x1b[0m Share this:TwitterFacebookPrintLinkedInRedditTumblrPinterestWhatsAppEmailLike Loading...

Britain had never given such a pledge to an eastern European country. There had never been a special relationship with Poland. Even Winston Churchill was amazed.'His Majesty's Government have given a guarantee to Poland. I was astounded when I heard them give this guarantee,' he told MPs in May 1939, when still a backbencher.So why did Britain do it? The answer of course, had less to do with Poland, and much more to do with Nazi Germany. In March 1939, Poland's southern neighbour Czechoslovakia fell apart. Adolf Hitler's German forces moved in, and Britain's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain decided that Germany could not be allowed to threaten another country. Few people remember that Britain didn't just offer support to Poland. It also pledged to help Greece and Romania, should either of those countries be attacked. Chamberlain called the assurances 'first aid treatment' - an admission that the pledges were made in a hurry, with no thought to how such promises might be honoured. Britain hoped that would be enough - it was not. Germany attacked and defeated Poland in a few weeks.

In film role, McCallum notably appeared in The Great Escape (1963), and as Judas Iscariot in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965). Early life "", ""Beginning in 2003, starting with the original backdoor pilot on the series JAG, McCallum starred in the CBS television series NCIS as Dr. Donald 'Ducky' Mallard, the team's chief medical examiner and one of the show's most popular characters. In Season 2 Episode 13 'The Meat Puzzle', NCIS Special Agent Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander) asks Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), 'What did Ducky look like when he was younger?' and Gibbs replies, 'Illya Kuryakin'. According to the behind-the-scenes feature on the 2006 DVD of NCIS season 1, McCallum became an expert in forensics to play Mallard, including attending medical examiner conventions. In the feature, Donald P. Bellisario says that McCallum's knowledge became so vast that at the time of the interview, he was considering making him a technical adviser to the show. "", ""'He was a true Renaissance man — he was fascinated by science and culture and would turn those passions into knowledge. For example, he was capable of conducting a symphony orchestra and (if needed) could actually perform an autopsy, based on his decades-long studies for his role on NCIS,' Peter McCallum said in a statement.

As a result, the two compounds can travel long distances where they become part of the rain, sleet, snow, and fog that we experience on certain days.

Acid rain can fall on buildings, cars, and trees, and can make lakes acidic. In addition, acid rain can also be inhaled by people and cause health problems. What causes acid rain? \x1b[92m[9] Acid rain results when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents.\x1b[0m SO2 and NOx react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.

However, if the precipitation becomes too acidic (for instance through man-made influences), then these materials may not be able to neutralize all of the acids. The resulting acidification of the ground results in damage to crops, trees, lakes, rivers, and animals. Why is acid rain harmful?

The heating of homes, electricity production, and driving vehicles all rely primarily on fossil fuel energy. When fossil fuels are burned, acid-forming nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are released to the atmosphere. These chemical compounds are transformed in the atmosphere, often traveling thousands of kilometers from their original source, and then fall out on land and water surfaces as acid rain. As a result, air pollutants from power plants in the states of New Jersey or Michigan can impact pristine forests or lakes in undeveloped parts of the states of New Hampshire or Maine.[3] ', 'https://www.epa.gov/acidrain/what-acid-rain\nThis image illustrates the pathway for acid rain in our environment: (1) Emissions of SO2 and NOx are released into the air, where (2) the pollutants are transformed into acid particles that may be transported long distances.

These then mix with water and other materials before falling to the ground.

The word is a 'strongly affirmative honorary form of address' [10] and every occurrence of it in the New Testament refers to governing officials (Acts 23:26; 24:3; 26:25).

As one scholar writes, 'the extensive linguistic and theological agreements and cross-references between the Gospel of Luke and the Acts indicate that both works derive from the same author'. Because of their common authorship, the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles are often jointly referred to simply as Luke-Acts.

In this article, we will dive into the story and legacy behind Dusty Springfield’s 'Son of a Preacher Man'.The Story Behind the SongDespite being synonymous with Dusty Springfield, John Hurley and Ronnie Wilkins initially wrote 'Son of a Preacher Man' for Aretha Franklin. By 1967, the songwriters were a respected duo in the music industry and were invited by producer Jerry Wexler to work in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, which was a recording hotspot in the 1960s and 70s.

Tarantino stated he probably wouldn’t have used the scene if he wasn’t allowed to use the song. Pulp Fiction’s soundtrack eventually sold over 2 million copies and a re-release of 'Son of a Preacher Man' reached number 1 in Iceland.In an interview with The Robesonian, Ronnie Wilkins thanked Quentin Tarantino for using the song. 'I’m not sure he knew how much money that made for me,' he funnily remarked. 'I remember he called me up to ask about using it and then I more or less forgot about it. Later, I heard Siskel and Roper say the movie had a great soundtrack, and then I was blown away seeing how Quentin took it to a whole other level.'Dusty Springfield by Anefo – CC0The Legacy of Son of a Preacher ManOver the years, 'Son of a Preacher Man' became Dusty Springfield’s signature song and one of the most well-known songs of the 1960s. Aretha Franklin eventually regretted not recording the song and released a version of the song on her 1970 album This Girl’s in Love with You.In 1996, Dusty Springfield revealed she initially didn’t like her version of the song and preferred Aretha Franklin’s version. 'I hated it because I couldn’t be Aretha Franklin. I was someone who had come from thundering drums and Phil Spector, and I didn’t understand sparseness. I wanted to fill every space. When I got free of that I finally liked it, but it took me a long time… To this day I listen to Aretha Franklin’s phrasing and go, ‘Goddamit!’ That’s the way I should have done it.'

The lyrics are from an early-19th-century English poem written by Jane Taylor, 'The Star'. The poem, which is in couplet form, was first published in 1806 in Rhymes for the Nursery, a collection of poems by Taylor and her sister Ann. \x1b[92m[1] It is now sung to the tune of the French melody 'Ah!\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] vous dirai-je, maman', which was first published in 1761 and later arranged by several composers, including Mozart with Twelve Variations on 'Ah vous dirai-je, Maman'\x1b[0m. The English lyrics have five stanzas, although only the first is widely known. Where Jane Taylor was when she wrote the lyric is contested, with the localities of Colchester and Chipping Ongar each asserting a claim. However, Ann Taylor writes (in The Autobiography and Other Memorials of Mrs. Gilbert) that the first time Jane ever saw the village of Ongar was in 1810, and the poem had been published in 1806. 'In the summer of 1810, Jane, when visiting London, had enjoyed a pic-nic excursion in Epping Forest, and observed on a sign post at one of the turnings, 'To Ongar.' It was the first time she had seen the name.' Lyrics The English lyrics were written as a poem by Jane Taylor (1783–1824) and published with the title 'The Star' in Rhymes for the Nursery by Jane and her sister Ann Taylor (1782–1866) in London in 1806: Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are!

For events preceding September 1, 1939, see the timeline of events preceding World War II. Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 brought many countries into the war. This event, and the declaration of war by France and Britain two days later, mark the beginning of World War II. After the declaration of war, Western Europe saw minimal land and air warfare, leading to this time period being termed the 'Phoney War'. At sea, this time period saw the opening stages of the Battle of the Atlantic. In eastern Europe, however, the agreement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed on 23 August opened the way in September for the Soviet Union's invasion of eastern Poland, which was divided between the two countries before the end of the month. The Soviet Union began a new military offensive by invading Finland at the end of November.

First published in 1962, the book won the Newbery Medal, the Sequoyah Book Award, the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, and was runner-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Award.[a] \x1b[92m[1] The main characters – Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry, and Calvin O'Keefe – embark on a journey through space and time, from galaxy to galaxy, as they endeavor to rescue the Murrys' father and fight The Black Thing that has intruded into several worlds\x1b[0m. The novel offers a glimpse into the war between light and darkness, and good and evil, as the young characters mature into adolescents on their journey, and wrestles with questions of spirituality and purpose, as the characters are often thrown into conflicts of love, divinity, and goodness. It is the first book in L'Engle's Time Quintet, which follows the Murry family and O'Keefe. L'Engle modeled the Murry family on her own. B. E.

The island is covered with more than 100 volcanoes. Some are extinct, but over 30 are still active. The majority of volcanism in Iceland occurs along volcanic rift zones that cut through the centre of the island. At constructive plate boundaries, also known as divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move away from one another to produce volcanoes. Hot magma rises from the mantle at mid-ocean ridges, pushing the plates apart. BGS © UKRI. Note: Iceland also sits above a mantle plume, or hot spot, where hot magma wells up from deep in the Earth’s mantle. The interaction of these two types of volcanism, over the last 15 million years or more, has created the island of Iceland.

Iceland, however, is also associated with a mantle plume (a narrow stem of upwelling of magma from deep in the mantle) that has maintained volcanism high and vigorous [1]. Spreading creates some sort of symmetry in the buildup of the island (although slightly distorted by the mantle plume) with the youngest rocks situated on the ridge and the older rocks away from the ridge on both sides (Figure 1). ', ""https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html\nThe volcanic country of Iceland, which straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, offers scientists a natural laboratory for studying on land the processes also occurring along the submerged parts of a spreading ridge. Iceland is splitting along the spreading center between the North American and Eurasian Plates, as North America moves westward relative to Eurasia. \x1b[92m[0] Map showing the Mid-Atlantic Ridge splitting Iceland and separating the North American and Eurasian Plates.\x1b[0m The map also shows Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, the Thingvellir area, and the locations of some of Iceland's active volcanoes (red triangles), including Krafla. The consequences of plate movement are easy to see around Krafla Volcano, in the northeastern part of Iceland. Here, existing ground cracks have widened and new ones appear every few months. From 1975 to 1984, numerous episodes of rifting (surface cracking) took place along the Krafla fissure "", ""https://www.icelandontheweb.com/articles-on-iceland/nature/geology/tectonic-plates\n\x1b[92m[4] The tectonic plates move towards east and west, and both the North American and Eurasian systems move to the northwest across the hot spot.\x1b[0m On top of hot spots there's generally a 20-100% molten layer at the depth of 5-20 km, which supplies sufficient material for eruptions. Eruptions occur about every 5-10 years and primarily consist of basaltic lava and tephra. A few long-lived centres, such as the volcano Hekla, erupt more silicic magmas. Iceland's topography "", ""https://news.uoregon.edu/icelands-volcano-eruptions-may-last-decades-researchers-find\nAlmost all of Iceland’s island is built from lava, said Ilya Bindeman, a volcanologist and earth sciences professor at the UO. \x1b[92m[5] The country sits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the tectonic plate boundary that causes North America and Eurasia to push further apart.\x1b[0m The drifting of these plates can spark volcanic eruptions when hot rock from the earth’s mantle — the middle and largest layer of the planet — melts and rises to the surface.Although scientists know the origin of Reykjanes Peninsula’s current eruptions is plate movement, the kind of magma storage and plumbing systems that feed them are unidentified, Bindeman said. The peninsula consists of eight volcanically active sites, so understanding whether there is one shared magma source or multiple independent ones and their depth can help predict the duration and impact of these eruptions.Using geochemical and seismic data, the researchers investigated whether the magma of the initial eruptions from one volcano in the peninsula from 2021 to 2023 came from the same source as the magma in the recent eruptions of a different volcano to the west. Bindeman specializes in isotopic analysis, which can help identify the 'fingerprint' of magma. (See Focus on Equipment and Methodology below.) The unique combination of trace elements can help differentiate one magma source from another.

Because its history has always been closely related to volcanism, many volcanic eruptions since the middle ages have been recorded and preserved. Iceland was settled in 834 AD, established its own parliament in 930 AD and recorded its first historical volcanic eruption ~934 AD, during which Eldagia, the longest volcanic fissure in the world, was created. Due to the amount of volcanic activity – averaging one every three years – and the resulting devastation to the country of Iceland from lava, ash and sometimes years of famine, there is a well documented record of Icelandic volcanic eruptions. The volcanic materials settle onto the nearby Greenland ice sheet and become incorporated into the ice core record.

Not always the best way to love someone, but it’s pretty common. It’s okay to love someone. But it’s not okay to love someone in spite of yourself. So there’s my wedding song. Maybe. I don’t know why I equate it with weddings so much, other than the fact that the person I’ll be dancing with will be a flawed person whom I love. And that’s just the way it is.

This is done to take advantage of the wider angle that can be reflected by a Convex mirror. A convex mirror, also known as diverging mirror, is one which bulges at the middle and is thinner at the edges. While this captures a wider object field, it does so at the cost of image accuracy. The result is compression of the reflected image, which makes objects appear smaller and farther away than they really are. The warning is mentioned in the mirrors so that the driver can accordingly make adjustments and take a well calculated decision.

Uses ', 'https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8020681/tomato-puree-vs-paste-whats-the-difference/\n\x1b[95m[7] Tomato puree is commonly used as the base for sauces\x1b[0m (think marinara) that pair with pasta and pizzas. It can also be used as a base for salsa and hot sauce. You can add tomato puree to demi-glace—a brown sauce that uses beef or veal stock, brown roux and tomatoes and is commonly used in French cuisine—to add acidity and brightness. What Is Tomato Paste? \x1b[95m[8] Tomato paste is a concentrated form of cooked tomatoes\x1b[0m, where tomatoes are cooked, strained and cooked again until most of the liquid has evaporated and the tomatoes reach a thick, pasty texture similar to toothpaste. Because tomato paste is cooked for a longer period of time, it has a deep red hue and sweet flavor thanks to the natural sugars present in the tomatoes. Like tomato puree, store-bought tomato paste may contain added acid and salt. Tomato paste \x1b[95m[9] typically comes in small 6-ounce cans or in a tube that is easy to recap for repeated use\x1b[0m.

The carbohydrate molecules are obtained from the carbon dioxide from the use of chemical energy gathered during the reactions.

', 'https://www.albert.io/blog/photosynthesis-and-cellular-respiration-ap-biology-crash-course/\nThe process of photosynthesis is an essential AP® Biology concept to understand.  Photosynthesis is the means by which most of the plant life on Earth gets its energy.  All animals receive nutrients either from plants or from animals that get their energy from plants.  This means that plants are the basis for all of the ecosystems on Earth, making photosynthesis a very important process.  So, in order to understand how photosynthesis happens, biologists have to break it down into two parts, the light and dark reactions. 1. \x1b[92m[5] Light Reaction (or the Light-Dependent Reactions) This is the first step in the process of photosynthesis.\x1b[0m  \x1b[92m[6] The light reaction is the process by which the leaf of a plant will absorb energy from the sun (in the form of photons) and will transfer it into electron carriers and energy (in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP).\x1b[0m ', ""https://byjus.com/biology/light-dependent-reactions/\n\x1b[92m[1] 'Light reaction is the process of photosynthesis that converts energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP.'\x1b[0m What is Light Reaction? The light reaction is also known as photolysis reaction and takes place in the presence of light. It usually takes place in the grana of chloroplasts. The photosystems have pigment molecules. \x1b[92m[7] In the plants, chlorophyll is one of the primary pigments which actively takes part in the process of light reactions like photosynthesis.\x1b[0m The accessory pigments include carotenoids. The energy from the sun is absorbed by the chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts. The energy is then transferred to ATP and NADPH that is generated by two-electron transport chains. Water is used and oxygen is released during the process. Let us have an overview of light reaction and the mechanism involved in light reaction.

The energy 'excites' one of its electrons enough to leave the molecule and be transferred to a nearby primary electron acceptor. A molecule of water splits to release an electron, which is needed to replace the one donated. Oxygen and hydrogen ions are also formed from the splitting of water. Source: https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-2-the-light-dependent-reactions-of-photosynthesis/ For more information, watch the narrated Youtube video: "", ""https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-1-overview-of-photosynthesis/\nPhotosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. \x1b[92m[2] In the light-dependent reactions, which take place at the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy with the use of water.\x1b[0m The light-dependent reactions release oxygen from the hydrolysis of water as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules. The two reactions use carrier molecules to transport the energy from one to the other. The carriers that move energy from the light-dependent reactions to the Calvin cycle reactions can be thought of as 'full' because they bring energy. After the energy is released, the 'empty' energy carriers return to the light-dependent reactions to obtain more energy. Section Summary "", ""https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-wmopen-biology1/chapter/photosynthesis/\n\x1b[92m[8] Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light.\x1b[0m Organic pigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. Energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state. Energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. So retinal pigments can only 'see' (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. For the same reasons, plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation. "", 'https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-wmopen-biology1/chapter/photosynthesis/\n\x1b[92m[4] The pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight.\x1b[0m A photon strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. The energy travels to the reaction center that contains chlorophyll a to the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior. This action builds up a high concentration of ions. The ions flow through ATP synthase via chemiosmosis to form molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy and reducing power carrier for the light-independent reactions.

Why do golfers shout fore? The RulesThe more modern-day Rules of Golf cover the need to shout ‘fore' as early as Section 1.2a: Conduct Expected of All Players. This states that players are expected to play in the spirit of the game by 'showing consideration to others.'For example, by playing at a prompt pace, looking out for the safety of others, and not distracting the play of another player. \x1b[92m[2] If a player plays a ball in a direction where there might be a danger of hitting someone, they should immediately shout a warning, such as the traditional\x1b[0m warning of 'fore'.However, it also states that 'there is no penalty under the Rules for failing to act in this way, except that the Committee may disqualify a player for acting contrary to the spirit of the game if it finds that the player has committed serious misconduct.'And herein lies a problem, you could say.

Continue reading to learn what the golf term fore means and how to use it. What Does Fore Mean in Golf? Essentially, fore is a warning to everyone on the golf course that a ball has been hit and is coming their way instead of the intended area. Another way to define the golf term fore is by some synonyms such as 'watch out' or 'heads up'. It is used when a golfer hits a bad shot that goes so far offline that it could hit an unexpected golfer, or come close to them.It is proper etiquette to yell fore when this happens, and to point in the direction it’s heading for those who are too far away to hear you. The History of Fore in GolfThere are some different theories on how the golf term fore came to be:1. It is believed that \x1b[96m[3] the term 'forecaddie' is how the term 'fore' came to be\x1b[0m. \x1b[96m[4] In the 1700’s and 1800’s 'forecaddie' was someone who was hired by golf courses or golfers to keep track of where balls landed\x1b[0m. Nowadays this position is called a spotter. A forecaddie would stand where they suspected the balls were going to land to save time looking for rogue balls, and balls wasted. When the golfer would strike the ball they would yell 'forecaddie' so that they would know to keep an eye out for the oncoming ball. As golf developed more \x1b[96m[5] the term 'forecaddie' was shortened to 'fore' and is now used to warn golfers to 'look out' because there’s a possibility that the ball is coming their way\x1b[0m. 2. The second is from a military standpoint. When infantry advanced in formation in the 17th and 18th centuries, artillery batteries fired behind them shooting over their heads. An artilleryman about to fire would yell 'beware before' so that the infantry would know to avoid the shells that would be raining down from the sky. Thus in golf, fore was used as a shortened term of 'beware before'.

What Does Fore Mean in Golf? Essentially, fore is a warning to everyone on the golf course that a ball has been hit and is coming their way instead of the intended area. Another way to define the golf term fore is by some synonyms such as 'watch out' or 'heads up'. It is used when a golfer hits a bad shot that goes so far offline that it could hit an unexpected golfer, or come close to them.It is proper etiquette to yell fore when this happens, and to point in the direction it’s heading for those who are too far away to hear you. The History of Fore in GolfThere are some different theories on how the golf term fore came to be:1. It is believed that the term 'forecaddie' is how the term 'fore' came to be. In the 1700’s and 1800’s 'forecaddie' was someone who was hired by golf courses or golfers to keep track of where balls landed. Nowadays this position is called a spotter. A forecaddie would stand where they suspected the balls were going to land to save time looking for rogue balls, and balls wasted. When the golfer would strike the ball they would yell 'forecaddie' so that they would know to keep an eye out for the oncoming ball. As golf developed more the term 'forecaddie' was shortened to 'fore' and is now used to warn golfers to 'look out' because there’s a possibility that the ball is coming their way. 2. The second is from a military standpoint. When infantry advanced in formation in the 17th and 18th centuries, artillery batteries fired behind them shooting over their heads. An artilleryman about to fire would yell 'beware before' so that the infantry would know to avoid the shells that would be raining down from the sky. Thus in golf, fore was used as a shortened term of 'beware before'.

After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote Master of the Universe as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, and removed it from her website before publication.

In its initial iteration, E.L. \x1b[92m[6] James’ 50 Shades of Gray was known as Master of the Universe, written by James using the online handle Snowqueen’s Icedragon, as a fan fiction version of Stephenie Meyers’ Twilight saga – with the lead male figure transformed from a 114 year old vampire into an all-too human billionaire.\x1b[0m (Fan fiction, for those not familiar with it, are stories written by fans of the original story, using various story lines, characters and settings, often with large amounts of sex thrown into the mix.) As Downes writes, 'Many write unique pieces only sharing the most basic elements, while others lift whole sections of the source material in order to create their own works. This is called, in copyright, ‘derivative works,’ and renders these pieces as the property of the original creative force.' This also means, according to Downes, that it is Meyers who has the power to give her approval (or not) for these works.

299,299,299,379,[True],"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events\nA Series of Unfortunate Events is a series of thirteen children's novels written by American author Daniel Handler under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The books follow the turbulent lives of orphaned siblings Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire. After their parents' death in a fire, the children are placed in the custody of a murderous villain, Count Olaf, who attempts to steal their inheritance and causes numerous disasters with the help of his accomplices as the children attempt to flee. As the plot progresses, the Baudelaires gradually confront further mysteries surrounding their family and deep conspiracies involving a secret society, which also involves Olaf and Snicket, the author's own fictional self-insert. Prior to the publication of A Series of Unfortunate Events, Handler had never written for children. According to an interview with Handler, he was encouraged to try writing children's books by his friend and editor, Susan Rich. In a separate author interview, Daphne Merkin wrote that Handler adapted a manuscript for a 'mock-gothic' book originally intended for adults into a series more suited for children. Handler invented the pseudonym 'Lemony Snicket' as an inside joke among friends years before the publication of A Series of Unfortunate Events.

The song was first recorded by Holiday in 1941 and has been covered by many artists since. \x1b[92m[0] The song became a sort of anthem of independence and self-reliance for many in the Black community.\x1b[0m It served as a counterpoint to Judy Garland’s Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which was popular at that time. There is a note of defiance and skepticism directed at established authorities – government, the church and even the family…. Rich relations give crusts of bread and suchYou can help yourself, but don’t take too much The message of the song seems to be: If you want to get by in this world, you’re going to have to take care of yourself – you’re on your own. Today’s lesson from the Gospel of Mathew is the Parable of the Talents (reprised in Luke’s Gospel as the Parable of the Minas). ', ""https://www.lyricslayers.com/billie-holiday/175917/\nBillie Holiday's 'God Bless The Child' is a poignant song that delves into themes of self-reliance and the harsh realities of economic disparity. The lyrics reflect a conversation about the importance of having one's own means in a world where wealth and social status can dictate one's opportunities and friendships. The opening lines, 'Them that's got shall have / Them that's not shall lose,' echo the biblical sentiment of the rich getting richer while the poor get poorer, a commentary on the unforgiving nature of society's distribution of wealth.The song further explores the fickle nature of relationships based on financial status. Holiday sings about how money attracts many friends, but these relationships are often superficial and disappear once the wealth is gone. This is a stark reminder of the value of genuine connections that are not influenced by material possessions. \x1b[92m[1] The repeated lines, 'Mama may have, Papa may have / But God bless the child that's got his own,' serve as a powerful refrain, emphasizing the blessing and strength found in self-sufficiency and not relying on others for one's well-being.Billie Holiday's performance of the song, with her emotive and soulful voice, adds depth to the message, making it resonate with listeners across generations.\x1b[0m The song is not just a reflection on economic inequality but also an anthem of empowerment, encouraging individuals to strive for personal independence and to take control of their own destiny, regardless of their circumstances.

Alle Dinge sind Gift, und nichts ist ohne Gift; allein die Dosis macht, dass ein Ding kein Gift ist.All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison. —Paracelsus, 1538 'The dose makes the poison' (Latin: dosis sola facit venenum 'only the dose makes the poison') is an adage intended to indicate a basic principle of toxicology. \x1b[92m[1] It is credited to Paracelsus who expressed the classic toxicology maxim 'All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; the dosage alone makes it so a\x1b[0m thing is not a poison.'

Nearly all of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, participated in the conflict, and many invested all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities in pursuit of total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70–85 million fatalities. Millions died due to genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria, Japan and Korea were occupied, and war crime tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.

Later that year, US President Harry S. Truman announced Japan’s surrender and the end of World War II. The news spread quickly and celebrations erupted across the United States. On September 2, 1945, formal surrender documents were signed aboard the USS Missouri, designating the day as the official Victory over Japan Day (V-J Day).

330,330,330,344,[True],"['https://byjus.com/chemistry/precipitation-reaction/\nMany chemical reactions occur in our daily lives. Common examples of such reactions are burning, corrosion, cooking of food and digestion. One important class of chemical reactions are precipitation reactions. In such reactions, two different soluble salts (which are in aqueous solutions) combine to form two products. \x1b[92m[7] One of these products is insoluble in the solution and is precipitated out (and is, therefore, referred to as the ‘precipitate’).\x1b[0m Precipitation Reaction – Definition and Meaning ', 'https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Main_Group_Reactions/Reactions_in_Aqueous_Solutions/Precipitation_Reactions\n\x1b[92m[4] Precipitates are insoluble ionic solid products of a reaction, formed when certain cations and anions combine in an aqueous solution.\x1b[0m The determining factors of the formation of a precipitate can vary. Some reactions depend on temperature, such as solutions used for buffers, whereas others are dependent only on solution concentration. The solids produced in precipitate reactions are crystalline solids, and can be suspended throughout the liquid or fall to the bottom of the solution. The remaining fluid is called supernatant liquid. The two components of the mixture (precipitate and supernate) can be separated by various methods, such as filtration, centrifuging, or decanting. Figure 1: Above is a diagram of the formation of a precipitate in solution. Precipitation and Double Replacement Reactions ', 'https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/igcse/chemistry/how-do-precipitate-formations-indicate-chemical-changes\n\x1b[92m[3] ArticleHow do precipitate formations indicate chemical changes?Precipitate formations indicate chemical changes by showing that a new substance has been created in a reaction.In chemistry, a precipitate is a solid that forms in a solution during a chemical reaction.\x1b[0m This process is known as precipitation. When two solutions are mixed together, if a chemical reaction occurs, it often results in the formation of a new substance. This new substance can be a gas, a different solution, or a solid. \x1b[92m[10] When a solid is formed, it is called a precipitate.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[8] The formation of a precipitate is a clear sign that a chemical change has taken place.The formation of a precipitate is a result of a specific type of chemical reaction called a precipitation reaction.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] In a precipitation reaction, two soluble reactants combine to form an insoluble product, the precipitate.\x1b[0m This precipitate will often settle at the bottom of the reaction vessel or float to the top, depending on its density relative to the solution. For example, if you mix solutions of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl), a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) forms. The equation for this reaction is AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO3. The silver chloride is the precipitate, and its formation indicates that a chemical change has occurred.Precipitation reactions are important in many areas of chemistry, including analytical chemistry, where they are used to identify the presence of certain ions in a solution. By observing the formation of a precipitate, chemists can infer that a chemical reaction has taken place, and use this information to identify the substances involved in the reaction.In conclusion, the formation of a precipitate is a clear visual indicator of a chemical change. It shows that a new substance has been created as a result of a chemical reaction, providing evidence of a chemical change.Answered by Till - University of Cambridge: Master’s in Chemical Engineering ', 'https://www.vaia.com/en-us/textbooks/chemistry/chemistry-matter-and-change-2007-edition/chapter-9/problem-78-under-what-conditions-does-a-precipitate-form-in-/\n\x1b[92m[0] A precipitate forms in a chemical reaction when an insoluble solid is produced due to the interaction between two or more soluble reactants.\x1b[0m This occurs when a double displacement reaction takes place and at least one insoluble product is formed according to the solubility rules. Factors like temperature, concentration, and pressure can also affect precipitation. Step by step solution 01 Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction Write down a balanced chemical equation involving the reactants provided in the problem. 02 Determine the solubility of the reactants and products Consult a solubility chart to determine which of the reactants and products are soluble or insoluble in water. 03 Identify if a double displacement reaction occurs Analyze the chemical equation to see if a double displacement reaction takes place, in which the ions from two different compounds exchange places, potentially forming a precipitate. 04 Apply the solubility rules ', 'https://www.toppr.com/guides/chemistry/solutions/precipitation-reaction-definition-and-examples/\n\x1b[92m[5] A precipitation reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs in aqueous solution and form precipitates.\x1b[0m Further, chemical reactions consist of chemical changes that take place within the substances. Thus, it gives rise to a new element under some particular conditions. Moreover, chemical reactions occur between two or more chemical compounds that we refer to as reactants. Thus, the reactants can be in forms of solid, gas or liquid. What is Precipitation Reaction? It means the chemical reaction occurs in aqueous solutions where two ions bond together to form insoluble salts. These insoluble salts formed are precipitates that are the products of it. They can be single displacement reactions or double displacement reactions. In a double displacement reaction, both ionic reactants dissociate in water and their ions bonds with the respective cation or anion from the other reactant. ', 'https://byjus.com/chemistry/precipitation-reaction/\nThe formation of a precipitate also suggests the presence of a chemical reaction. When a silver nitrate solution is poured into a sodium chloride solution, a chemical reaction occurs, producing a white silver chloride precipitate. Q3 What is an example of formation of precipitate? When a silver nitrate solution is poured into a sodium chloride solution, a chemical reaction occurs, producing a white silver chloride precipitate. A yellow lead(II) iodide precipitate is formed when the potassium iodide solution reacts with the lead(II) nitrate solution. Q4 Is Salt a precipitate? \x1b[92m[2] The insoluble salt falling out of the solution is referred to as the precipitate, hence the name of the reaction.\x1b[0m Precipitation reactions in the solution can help determine the identity of different ions. Q5 What factors affect precipitation? ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)\n\x1b[92m[9] In an aqueous solution, precipitation is the 'sedimentation of a solid material (a precipitate) from a liquid solution'.\x1b[0m The solid formed is called the precipitate. In case of an inorganic chemical reaction leading to precipitation, the chemical reagent causing the solid to form is called the precipitant. The clear liquid remaining above the precipitated or the centrifuged solid phase is also called the supernate or supernatant. The notion of precipitation can also be extended to other domains of chemistry (organic chemistry and biochemistry) and even be applied to the solid phases (e.g. metallurgy and alloys) when solid impurities segregate from a solid phase. Supersaturation Main article: Supersaturation The precipitation of a compound may occur when its concentration exceeds its solubility. This can be due to temperature changes, solvent evaporation, or by mixing solvents. Precipitation occurs more rapidly from a strongly supersaturated solution. "", ""https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/backgrounders/evidence-chemical-change\nIn some chemical reactions, the gas produced can be highly toxic. This can happen at home if certain cleaning products are mixed together. Breathing the gas created from mixing some cleaning products can even result in death. This is why you should never use two different cleaning products together - ever! \x1b[92m[6] Precipitate Formation Sometimes when two solutions undergo a chemical reaction, one of the new products formed from the reaction is not soluble.\x1b[0m This means that it is not able to dissolve in the new solution. Instead, we can observe a solid that is distinct and separate from the solution. We call this solid a precipitate. You have probably heard the word 'precipitation', but maybe not when talking about chemistry. We also use the word precipitation to refer to the types of water that fall from the sky. The solid in a precipitation reaction also often falls, or sinks, to the bottom of the solution. Precipitation reactions are all double replacement reactions.

The system consists of the following steps: Contents show Step 1 – Divide your paper into two columns Step 2 – Take notes in the note-taking column Step 3 – Review your notes within 24 hours "", ""https://www.universitylibrarian.com/blog/the-cornell-method-of-notetaking\n\x1b[92m[2] The Cornell Method of Notetaking is a powerful, yet simple technique designed to enhance learning, studying, and structured note creation.\x1b[0m The method involves dividing the page into sections: one for main ideas, another for details, and a summary, promoting effective organization and retention. This post outlines a four-step process, emphasizing taking notes in class, summarizing, and reviewing notes for optimal understanding.The Cornell format includes a header section, a summary section, a main notetaking section, and a cue section.  We’ve provided some practical tips, such as using short sentences, abbreviations, and symbols for efficient notetaking. The method's benefits include focused learning, easy notetaking, clear and structured notes, and enhanced skimming ability.However, there are some drawbacks, such as the challenge of paraphrasing in real-time and the necessity of working within the method's structured framework. It is recommended that when using the Cornell Method of notetaking you complete the cue and summary sections soon after lectures to maximize recall benefits. Overall, the Cornell Method proves beneficial for lectures, independent study, and group sessions, offering a clear structure for effective learning and retention.

These include 'Heelgate' in which numerous female attendees of a red carpet premiere were stopped from entering in 2015 for wearing flat soled shoes instead of high heels.

Out of a list of ten French towns, the choice initially fell on Biarritz on 9 May 1939. But the supporters of Cannes around Georges Prade, a municipal councillor from Paris, and the directors of the Cannes hotels, mobilised and finally ended up winning the event. And so, on 31 May 1939, the town of Cannes and the government signalled the official birth of the International Film Festival, a mere three months before the event’s inauguration date. The ‘Pearl of the Riviera’, a jewel on a coastline often compared with California, began to dream of Hollywood.

Consider splitting content into sub-articles, condensing it, or adding subheadings. Please discuss this issue on the article's talk page. \x1b[92m[1] (November 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this message) In the Germanic languages, a strong verb is a verb that marks its past tense by means of changes to the stem vowel.\x1b[0m The majority of the remaining verbs form the past tense by means of a dental suffix, are known as weak verbs, and outnumber strong verbs. "", 'https://blogs.transparent.com/german/weak-verbs-in-german/\nWeak Verbs in German Posted by Sandra Rösner on May 7, 2012 in Language In German, there are two basic forms of verbs: weak verbs and strong verbs. Weak verbs or regular verbs are those that follow a set pattern of rules and retain the same stem vowel throughout. These verbs are called weak verbs because you might think of them as being simply too weak to alter the patterns they follow – when they are conjugated. \x1b[92m[0] Strong verbs, on the other hand, do not follow a set pattern of conjugation, that is, the stem vowel will change when you, for example, form the past form of a strong verb.\x1b[0m When you are a native speaker of English you have already come across strong and weak verbs in your mother language. As mentioned above, German weak verbs are nothing else than English regular verbs (e.g. walk-walked-walked), and German strong verbs are nothing else than English irregular verbs (go-went-gone), so to speak. ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_strong_verb\nAs well as developing the strong verb system, Germanic also went on to develop two other classes of verbs: the weak verbs and a third, much smaller, class known as the preterite-present verbs, which are continued in the English auxiliary verbs, e.g. can/could, shall/should, may/might, must. Weak verbs originally derived from other types of word in PIE and originally occurred only in the present aspect. They did not have a perfect aspect, meaning that they came to lack a past tense in Germanic once the perfect had become the past[clarification needed]. Not having a past tense at all, they obviously also had no vowel alternations between present and past. To compensate for this, a new type of past tense was eventually created for these verbs by adding a -d- or -t- suffix to the stem. \x1b[92m[2] This is why only strong verbs have vowel alternations: their past tense forms descend from the original PIE perfect aspect, while the past tense forms of weak verbs were created later.\x1b[0m ']",how many strong verbs are there in german,"In the German language, there are approximately 200 strong verbs. These verbs undergo a vowel change in their stem when conjugated in the past tense, unlike weak verbs [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.","In the German language, there are approximately 200 strong verbs.

By the late 1970s, 'The Fool on the Hill' was one of McCartney's most widely recorded ballads. A solo demo and an outtake of the song were included on the Beatles' 1996 compilation album Anthology 2. Background and lyrics The song's lyrics describe the titular 'fool', a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise. In his authorised biography, Many Years from Now, Paul McCartney \x1b[92m[2] says he first got the idea for the premise from the Dutch design collective the Fool, who were the Beatles' favourite designers in 1967 and told him that they had derived their name from the Tarot card of the same name\x1b[0m. According to McCartney, \x1b[92m[3] the song possibly relates to a character such as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Beatles' meditation teacher: 'Fool on the Hill' was mine and I think I was writing about someone like Maharishi\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] His detractors called him a fool\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Because of his giggle, he wasn't taken too seriously\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] It was this idea of a fool on the hill, a guru in a cave, I was attracted to\x1b[0m ... I was sitting at the piano at my father's house in Liverpool hitting a D 6th chord, and I made up 'Fool on the Hill'. Alistair Taylor, in his book Yesterday, reports a mysterious incident involving a man who inexplicably appeared near him and McCartney during a walk on Primrose Hill and then disappeared again, soon after McCartney and Taylor had conversed about the existence of God. In Taylor's account, this incident prompted McCartney to write 'The Fool on the Hill'.

It contains no blood supply of its own—which is why you can shave your skin and not cause any bleeding despite losing many cells in the process. Assuming, that is, you don’t nick your skin to deep, where the blood supply is actually found. The epidermis is itself divided into at least four separate parts. A fifth part is present in some areas of our body. In order from the deepest layer of the epidermis to the most superficial, these layers (strata) are the: Stratum basale Stratum spinosum Stratum granulosum Stratum lucidum Stratum corneum Skin overview: Skin layers, of both hairy and hairless skin. Stratum Basale Human skin: This image details the parts of the integumentary system. ', 'https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Biology/Human_Biology_(Wakim_and_Grewal)/13%3A_Integumentary_System/13.3%3A_Skin\nOnly on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, the next layer above the stratum granulosum is the stratum lucidum. This is a layer consisting of stacks of translucent, dead keratinocytes that provide extra protection to the underlying layers. Stratum Corneum The uppermost layer of the epidermis everywhere on the body is the stratum corneum. \x1b[92m[2] This layer is made of flat, hard, tightly packed dead keratinocytes that form a waterproof keratin barrier to protect the underlying layers of the epidermis.\x1b[0m Dead cells from this layer are constantly shed from the surface of the body. The shed cells are continually replaced by cells moving up from the lower layers of the epidermis. It takes a period of about 48 days for newly formed keratinocytes in the stratum basale to make their way to the top of the stratum corneum to replace shed cells. Functions of the Epidermis ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin\nThe epidermis contains no blood vessels, and cells in the deepest layers are nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air and to a far lesser degree by blood capillaries extending to the outer layers of the dermis. The main type of cells that make up the epidermis are Merkel cells, keratinocytes, with melanocytes and Langerhans cells also present. The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, and basale. Cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer. The daughter cells (see cell division) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off (desquamation). This process is called 'keratinization'. \x1b[92m[3] This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and pathogens out, making skin a natural barrier to infection.\x1b[0m "", 'https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Biology/Human_Biology_(Wakim_and_Grewal)/13%3A_Integumentary_System/13.3%3A_Skin\nThe epidermis is the outer of the two main layers of the skin, the inner layer being the dermis. It averages about 0.10 mm thick and is much thinner than the dermis. The epidermis is thinnest on the eyelids (0.05 mm) and thickest on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (1.50 mm). The epidermis covers almost the entire body surface.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 7, 1999. In the episode, Homer discovers that a new television show, Police Cops, has a hero also named Homer Simpson. He is delighted with the positive attention he receives because of his name, but when the television character is rewritten from a hero to a bumbling idiot, he is mocked and taunted, so he changes his name to 'Max Power' to rid himself of the negative attention. Max gains new friends, and is forced into a protest to prevent a forest from being knocked down. In the end, he changes his name back to Homer Simpson. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Pete Michels. Since airing, it has received mixed reviews from television critics. Overall, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.5. Plot Following the pilot, however, the Homer Simpson character is rewritten as Lance's overweight and inept comic relief sidekick who mistakes the toys for guns program as 'guns for toys' and the police chief's insulin shipment for illegal drugs. He also spouts the mindless catchphrase 'Uh-oh! SpaghettiOs!', resulting in Homer being mocked by the people of Springfield. Humiliated, he appeals to the producers to change the character back, but they refuse, instead using Homer's plea and incompetent exit as material.

With his new identity comes a massive change in attitude, as Max is much more assertive and freewheeling than Homer was. While shopping at Costington's, Max meets a successful businessman named Trent Steel. Trent invites Max and the family to a garden party, despite Marge's reservations, where they meet many famous people, but Max finds out the party is an excuse to save a redwood forest from destruction. After travelling with the party guests to the forest, Max, Marge, and everyone else chain themselves to the trees to prevent the bulldozers from knocking them down. The Springfield police arrive and Eddie and Lou chase Max around his tree, trying to 'swab' him with mace. As Max rounds the tree, the chain cuts into it. The redwood falls and knocks down all other redwoods, angering their newfound friends.

The eight-minute British short film used the Kinemacolor process to capture a series of shots of the Brighton Southern England seafront. \x1b[92m[0] The first feature length, non-documentary film was The World, the Flesh and the Devil produced in 1914.\x1b[0m The feature length drama film is now considered a lost film, but was the first feature length film to use the Kinemacolor process.When did color movies come out?The early days of color in filmBefore the Kinemacolor process was used in film, filmmakers used more laborious and expensive methods to introduce color in cinema. Color films date further back than people think. Tinting was used in the early days of motion pictures to represent color in film, but portrayed an entirely monochromatic image. Many early filmmakers and innovators employed the use of stenciling, or hand coloring film images. The movie A Trip to the Moon (1902) required an entire assembly line of workers to color every frame.NOTE: The version embedded below is NOT the original color version.

The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5 in the human stomach lumen, a level maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase. The parietal cell releases bicarbonate into the bloodstream in the process, which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood, known as an alkaline tide. \x1b[92m[3] The acidic gastric juice also contains digestive enzymes produced by other cells in the gastric glands – gastric chief cells\x1b[0m. Gastric chief cells secrete an inactivated pepsinogen. Once in the stomach lumen gastric acid activates the proenzyme to pepsin. Gastric acid further inhibits the survival and progress of many pathogens in the stomach Secretion A typical adult human stomach will secrete about 1.5 liters of gastric juice daily. Gastric juice is the combination of gastric gland secretions including the main component of hydrochloric acid (gastric acid), gastric lipase and pepsinogen. Once in the stomach pepsinogen is changed by gastric acid to the digestive enzyme pepsin adding this enzyme to the gastric juice. Gastric acid secretion is produced in several steps. Chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted separately from the cytoplasm of parietal cells and mixed in the canaliculi. This creates a negative potential of between −40 and −70 mV across the parietal cell membrane that causes potassium ions and a small number of sodium ions to diffuse from the cytoplasm into the parietal cell canaliculi. Gastric acid is then secreted along with other gland secretions into the gastric pit for release into the stomach lumen.

A common year has 365 days and a leap year 366 days, with the extra— or intercalary— day designated as February 29. \x1b[92m[0] A leap year occurs every four years to help synchronize the calendar year with the solar year, or the length of time it takes to complete the Earth's orbit around the sun, which is about 365 days and a quarter of a day.\x1b[0m The length of the solar year, however, is slightly less than 365¼ days-by about 11 minutes. To compensate for this discrepancy, the leap year is omitted three times every four hundred years. In other words, a century year cannot be a leap year unless it is divisible by 400. Thus 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years. When Are Leap Years?

448,448,448,267,[True],"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion%27s_mane_jellyfish\nThe lion's mane jellyfish (\x1b[92m[1] Cyanea capillata\x1b[0m), also known as the giant jellyfish, arctic red jellyfish, or the hair jelly, is one of the largest known species of jellyfish. Its range is confined to cold, boreal waters of the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. It is common in the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea, and in western Scandinavian waters south to Kattegat and Øresund. It may also drift into the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea (where it cannot breed due to the low salinity). Similar jellyfish – which may be the same species – are known to inhabit seas near Australia and New Zealand. The largest recorded specimen was measured off the coast of Massachusetts in 1865 and had a bell with a diameter of 210 centimetres (7 feet) and tentacles around 36.6 m (120 ft) long. Lion's mane jellyfish have been observed below 42°N latitude for some time in the larger bays of the East Coast of the United States. The lion's mane jellyfish uses its stinging tentacles to capture, pull in, and eat prey such as fish, zooplankton, sea creatures, and smaller jellyfish. Taxonomy \x1b[92m[1] Cyanea capillata\x1b[0m, expanding (top), contracting (bottom) The taxonomy of the Cyanea species is not fully agreed upon; some zoologists have suggested that all species within the genus should be treated as one. Two distinct taxa, however, occur together in at least the eastern North Atlantic, with the blue jellyfish (Cyanea lamarckii Péron & Lesueur, 1810) differing in color (blue, not red) and smaller size (10–20 cm [3+7⁄8–7+7⁄8 inches] diameter, rarely 35 cm [14 inches]). Populations in the western Pacific around Japan are sometimes distinguished as Cyanea nozakii, or as a subspecies, C. c. nozakii. In 2015, Russian researchers announced a possible sister species, Cyanea tzetlinii found in the White Sea. Description Lion's mane jellyfish (\x1b[92m[1] Cyanea capillata\x1b[0m) are named for their showy, trailing tentacles reminiscent of a lion's mane. They can vary greatly in size: although capable of attaining a bell diameter of over 2 m (6 ft 7 in), those found in lower latitudes are normally smaller than their far northern counterparts, with a bell about 50 cm (20 in) in diameter. Furthermore, larger specimens are typically further offshore than smaller ones. Juveniles are lighter orange or tan, very young lion's manes are occasionally colorless and adults are red and start to darken as they age.

It is common in the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea, and in western Scandinavian waters south to Kattegat and Øresund.

But tilapia, a freshwater fish native to the warm, shallow waters of Africa, which was introduced to the Sea unintentionally, has thrived and proliferated in the absence of predators.  \x1b[92m[1] Though considered a freshwater species, tilapia show a degree of tolerance to saltwater conditions and have been able to persist in the increasingly saline environment.\x1b[0m  Even today, fishing is, supposedly, good around the lake, with no catch limits on tilapia. But all is not well with the ichthyofauna of the Salton Sea. ', 'https://saltonsea.com/about/faq/\nSoon after the Salton Sea formed in 1905 many types of fish were stocked into the Sea for sport and commercial fishing purposes. In fact the Sea was a major sport fishing destination for nearly 60 years. At the beginning, the Sea was not salty and would support many different types of fish. As the Sea reached salt levels similar to the ocean many ocean species were stocked into the Sea as well. The salinity has unfortunately reached a point where it is assumed that the only species of fish that presently inhabit the Sea are the algae eating tilapia, that were introduced into the All American Canal for algae control in the 1960s, and the endangered, indigenous pupfish. \x1b[92m[0] The tilapia have managed to adapt to the high salt levels however scientists believe that the salinity is reaching a tipping point where even the tilapia will soon have a massive die-off.\x1b[0m It was estimated in the 1990s that the Sea was home to millions of tilapia.

462,462,462,298,"[True, True]","[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin\nViolins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it. Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed. Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial 'trade violins' coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker. Etymology The word 'violin' was first used in English in the 1570s. The word 'violin' comes from '\x1b[92m[1] Italian violino, [a] diminutive of viola\x1b[0m.

The role of acid in our stomach is primarily related to digestion. \x1b[92m[0] The stomach produces hydrochloric acid[1] (HCl), which plays several crucial roles in breaking down food and facilitating nutrient absorption.\x1b[0m Here are the main functions of stomach acid: ', ""https://dpuhospital.com/blog/what-is-the-role-of-acid-in-our-stomach/\n\x1b[92m[1] Acid, specifically hydrochloric acid (HCl), plays a crucial role in the digestion of food within the stomach.\x1b[0m When we eat, the stomach's parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid to create an acidic environment with a pH ranging from approximately 1.5 to 3.5. This acidic milieu serves several essential functions in the digestion process. Firstly, the highly acidic environment denatures proteins present in the ingested food. Proteins in foods like meat and dairy have complex structures that need unraveling for proper digestion. Hydrochloric acid breaks down the protein's three-dimensional structure, exposing the peptide bonds between amino acids. This process[1] is vital because it enables subsequent digestive enzymes to access and cleave the protein into smaller peptide fragments. "", 'https://dpuhospital.com/blog/what-is-the-role-of-acid-in-our-stomach/\n\x1b[92m[4] Stomach acid, primarily hydrochloric acid (HCl), is a potent defense mechanism against ingested bacteria and pathogens.\x1b[0m When harmful microorganisms get ingested with food or water, they encounter a highly acidic environment. The low pH of stomach acid, which ranges from approximately 1.5 to 3.5, can kill many bacteria and pathogens that enter the digestive system. The acidic conditions disrupt the integrity of bacterial cell membranes, leading to their lysis or destruction. Additionally, the low pH denatures and inactivates certain bacterial enzymes and proteins, rendering them non-functional and incapable of causing infection or harm to the body. ', 'https://dpuhospital.com/blog/what-is-the-role-of-acid-in-our-stomach/\n\x1b[92m[2] In conclusion, the acid in our stomach, primarily hydrochloric acid (HCl), plays a pivotal role in digestion and the overall health of the gastrointestinal system.\x1b[0m Its acidic properties enable the breakdown of complex proteins, initiating digestion and facilitating the activation of digestive enzymes. Additionally, stomach acid acts as a critical defense mechanism, creating an inhospitable environment for harmful bacteria and pathogens that come with food. While stomach acid is essential for proper digestion and protection against infections, an imbalance in acid levels can lead to conditions like acid reflux and GERD, necessitating medical attention and appropriate management. Maintaining a healthy stomach acid balance through lifestyle modifications, dietary choices, and stress management is fundamental to promoting efficient digestion and ensuring overall gastrointestinal well-being.

During the gastric phase, the hormone gastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins. \x1b[92m[6] Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid, or hydrochloric acid (HCl) which aids in the digestion of the proteins.\x1b[0m However, when the stomach is emptied, the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid. This is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism. In the duodenum, digestive secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme during the intestinal phase. In order to neutralize the acidic chyme, a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum. Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called ']",what is the role of hcl in the stomach,"Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach plays a crucial role in digestion by breaking down food, activating digestive enzymes, and killing harmful bacteria, ensuring efficient nutrient absorption and gastrointestinal health [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m.","Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach plays a crucial role in digestion by breaking down food, activating digestive enzymes, and killing harmful bacteria, ensuring efficient nutrient absorption and gastrointestinal health.","['Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach plays a crucial role in digestion by breaking down food, activating digestive enzymes, and killing harmful bacteria, ensuring efficient nutrient absorption and gastrointestinal health \x1b[92m[0]\x1b[0m\x1b[92m[1]\x1b[0m\x1b[92m[2]\x1b[0m\x1b[92m[3]\x1b[0m\x1b[92m[4]\x1b[0m\x1b[92m[5]\x1b[0m\x1b[92m[6]\x1b[0m.']","['Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach plays a crucial role in digestion by breaking down food, activating digestive enzymes, and killing harmful bacteria, ensuring efficient nutrient absorption and gastrointestinal health.']","{'0': {'citation_numbers': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}}",No Failure,Post Hoc,,,,3,3,"[{'annotations': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 'sentence_id': '0'}]","[{'coverage': 1, 'sentence_id': '0'}]",[7.556602954864502],"[4.2990241050720215, 3.3271360397338867, 3.518498182296753, 4.89290714263916, 2.558562994003296, 3.2708520889282227, 4.132488965988159]"

About the Electoral College The U.S. Constitution created the Electoral College to ensure that each state has a role in selecting the president, no matter its population. Each state has the same number of electoral votes as it has members of Congress. There are a total of 538 votes in the Electoral College. A candidate must win a simple majority--270 electoral votes-- to win the election. "", ""https://votesmart.org/education/elections\nc.

They envisioned that the electors would carefully discuss the qualifications of each candidate and engage in vigorous debate before casting their votes and sending them to Congress. And in our country’s early elections the Electoral College did work this way because electors were chosen either by the state legislatures or by popular vote within each state. However, the development and rising power of political parties transformed this process from the Fathers’ idealistic vision. Over time, electors were no longer chosen for their distinction as citizens, but for their loyalty to a particular party. Today, electors are chosen at state party conventions or are appointed directly by party leaders. Each major party elects or appoints the same number of electors as the state has electoral votes. So, when the electors chosen in the November election meet in their respective state capitols in December, there is no vigorous debate about the presidential candidates’ qualifications—the electors simply vote for their party’s candidate.

The 23rd Amendment, ratified in 1961, assigns three additional electors to the District of Columbia, bringing the total number of electors to 538. To win, a presidential ticket must obtain a majority — 270 if all electors vote. Otherwise, the 12th Amendment provides that the House of Representatives chooses the president, with each state delegation receiving one vote, and the Senate chooses the vice president by majority vote.

Many of the Christmas traditions we know and love today like caroling and feasting emerged from Victorian England at this time. One important Christmas tradition included writing a long, personal letter and paying a visit to friends and acquaintances to wish them a cheerful holiday season. In a rapidly growing society, this left almost no time to get work done, and even the most tenacious extroverts were exhausted. \x1b[92m[2] Sir Cole thought he could solve both of his problems with the introduction of a beautifully decorated Christmas card to replace the long letter.\x1b[0m Thus, in 1843, the same year in which Charles Dickens published and popularized the Victorian holiday staple A Christmas Carol, Sir Henry Cole commissioned the design of a Christmas card from Mr. John Calcott Horsley.

M. Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, the film was directed by Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, and Wilfred Jackson. Featuring the voices of Bobby Driscoll, Kathryn Beaumont, Hans Conried, Bill Thompson, Heather Angel, Paul Collins, Tommy Luske, Candy Candido, Tom Conway, Roland Dupreee and Don Barclay, the film's plot follows Wendy Darling and her two brothers, who meet the never-growing-up Peter Pan and travel with him to the island of Never Land to stay young, where they also have to face Peter's archenemy, Captain Hook. "", ""https://collider.com/peter-pan-movie-book-comparison/\n'All children, except one, grow up.' With these words, British author J.M. Barrie began his classic 1911 children’s novel, Peter Pan and Wendy, an adaptation of his 1904 stage play, Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up. Beloved by generations, the story of the boy that refused to grow up and his adventures in Neverland alongside Wendy and the Lost Boys was adapted many times into movies. The most faithful retelling of the story is probably 2003’s Peter Pan, directed by P.J. Hogan. However, the most well-known and well-regarded cinematic version of Barrie’s book is definitely a little animated feature made by another creator of children’s classics: the Walt Disney Studios. \x1b[92m[4] Released in 1953, Disney’s Peter Pan has virtually become every child’s introduction to the world created by J.M.\x1b[0m Barrie. However, there are many differences between the Disney version of Peter’s story and Barrie’s original novel. Before checking out Disney's latest update of this classic character, in Peter Pan & Wendy, here are all the ways in which Peter Pan and Wendy differs from the Disney film. "", ""https://www.scld.org/peter-pan-the-boy-who-wouldnt-grow-up/\n\x1b[92m[18] J. M. Barrie originally wrote Peter Pan as a play (and then famously rewrote it and added to it many times).\x1b[0m While I have yet to see Peter Pan live on stage, my second introduction to Peter’s story was the musical version starring Mary Martin. This version originally aired live on NBC on March 7, 1955 to an audience of 65 million viewers. It was such a hit that it was eventually recorded and rebroadcast several times. In 1989, a VHS version was finally released, and promptly became a part of my childhood. At this time in my life, I was not so keen on getting older. I became slightly (ridiculously) obsessed with the boy who never grows up. To my parents’ chagrin, this version of Peter Pan, along with the Disney version, were watched ad nauseam for months. I remember watching and wishing as hard as I could that I, like Peter, would never grow up. Alas, 'all children, except one, grow up.' "", ""https://simonteen.com/2016/08/23/peter-pan-origin/\nThese guys, you’ve probably heard of. While walking his dog in Kensington Gardens near his home in London, Barrie struck up a friendship with Sylvia Davies and her five sons: George, Jack, Peter, Michael, and Nico. Barrie claimed in the introduction to the first print edition of the play that Peter is a result of the boys: 'I always knew that I made Peter by rubbing the five of you violently together, as savages with two sticks produce a flame…That is all he is, the spark I got from you.' His relationship with the family is the subject of many pieces of writing over the decades, as well the film Finding Neverland. While many have speculated over the past hundred years, there’s nothing to suggest he had an inappropriate relationship with the boys. 9. \x1b[92m[14] Barrie also really loved the popular adventure novels of his time.\x1b[0m "", ""http://unifiedpoptheory.com/who-is-peter-pan-based-on-and-why-do-you-think-he-is-the-angel-of-death/\nThere are many articles that justify the clues in Barrie’s life that explain Peter Pan. When Barrie was young, he did lose his older brother, so the creation of Neverland could have been a way of him 'staying young and innocent forever' — as his mother had said. I believe Peter Pan was truely the villain of his story, as the narrator in Barrie’s Peter Pan would state Peter 'thinning out' the population of Lost Boys, due to the fact that were getting older; since Peter is only a child, and spent an eternity as one, he hated adults and adulthood mercilessly. This links back in with Peter 'thinning out' the Lost Boys who broke the rules; the rules which are not growing up. I think Peter Pan has some ideal implications, and can mean many things — perhaps the story is biblical and full of myths. \x1b[92m[17] Or, Peter Pan is a story based in Barrie’s experiences, feelings and interactions with people, especially the Llewelyn Davies boys.\x1b[0m "", ""http://unifiedpoptheory.com/who-is-peter-pan-based-on-and-why-do-you-think-he-is-the-angel-of-death/\nBarrie created Peter Pan in stories he told to the sons of his friend Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, with whom he had forged a special relationship. Mrs. Llewelyn Davies’ death from cancer came within a few years after the death of her husband. \x1b[92m[13] Barrie was named as co-guardian of the boys and unofficially adopted them.\x1b[0m The character’s name comes from two sources: Peter Llewelyn Davies, one of the boys, and Pan, the mischievous Greek god of the woodlands. As we uncover the history behind Pan, a character that embodies timeless concepts of innocence and immortality, we discover that the meme that inspired this post may be onto something. The statement on the picture may not be completely true but it instigates a search for answers, in this case the question becomes 'Is Peter Pan the Angel of Death?' I don’t think so, but I do think that J. M. Barrie was motivated and inspired by death in his life. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_(1953_film)\n\x1b[92m[3] Peter Pan premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on February 5, 1953, and was simultaneously released in theaters as a double feature with the True-Life Adventures documentary short, Bear Country (1953).\x1b[0m To promote the film, a television special The Walt Disney Christmas Show was aired on CBS on December 25, 1951, with Bobby Driscoll and Kathryn Beaumont reprising their roles of Peter Pan and Wendy as live-action characters. \x1b[92m[10] A promotional behind-the-scenes featurette The Peter Pan Story was released the following year.\x1b[0m During its initial theatrical run, Peter Pan grossed $6 million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada and $2.6 million internationally.

The first trailer for Pan, a star-studded Peter Pan prequel, debuted in November. He played a major role as a villain in ABC's Once Upon a Time. Jake and the Neverland Pirates, a cartoon spin-off of the 1953 Disney film, has been showing up on TV since 2011. And tonight, you can tune in to NBC for the holiday event Peter Pan Live! starring Allison Williams as Pan and Christopher Walken as Captain Hook.The most notable thing about all these adaptations is how different they are from one another. When it comes to your average adaptation, changes are inevitable — particularly when you're working in different formats, like film, TV, or theater. Peter Pan is no different, but those who think they know his story might be surprised just how much he's changed along the way.Peter Pan originally debuted as an infant in The Little White Bird, a novel written by J.M. Barrie for adults in 1902. Though he's only prominent in a few chapters, the book's popularity — due, in part, to readers' attachment to Pan — led Barrie to write the 1904 play Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up. \x1b[92m[16] (Barrie eventually adapted his play into another, better-known novel: Peter Pan and Wendy.)\x1b[0m The play was the first to introduce audiences to characters such as Captain Hook, Wendy, and Tinkerbell, and to a fleshed-out version of Neverland.

This gave the hospital the royalties from every production of the play and publication of the book. A London production of Peter Pan at GOSH on 14 December 1929 "", ""https://thegreatdisneymovieride.home.blog/2019/04/09/peter-pan-1953/\n\x1b[92m[1] Finally, though, Peter Pan was released in 1953 after numerous dramatic story changes.\x1b[0m Barrie purists criticized the film for diverting from the original story. Notably, they didn’t like that the iconic 'clap your hands if you believe in fairies' scene was dropped and nearly all the dialogue was changed even though most of the plot remained the same. They felt that the spirit of the original was completely lost, a statement I agree with. The original play and book were written at a time where child mortality rates were very high, and that’s why Peter ‘never grew up’. He was an angel of death, escorting lost children to the afterlife. It was a way to comfort the families of children who grew ill and died. Disney dropped all that and morphed it into their trademark of holding onto childhood innocence and whimsy. I understand, and this movie more than any embodies that philosophy but that’s… not what the original is about. At all. That said, I don’t love the original either. But that’s more to do with the writing style than the subject matter.  And the subject matter is completely lost here.

"", ""https://collider.com/peter-pan-movie-book-comparison/\n\x1b[92m[9] Peter, on the other hand, is a lot meaner and more selfish in Barrie’s novel than in the 1953 film.\x1b[0m He doesn’t care much for John (Paul Collins) and Michael (Tommy Luske), and treats them only as a collateral of having Wendy around. His reason for fighting Hook (Hans Conried) and eventually chopping off his hand is nothing noble nor related to self-defense: the Lost Boys simply dare him to take down the pirate captain, and he agrees. Though Captain Hook remains the villain of the story, you kind of feel bad for the guy because he basically lost his hand because a group of children thought it would be fun. However, Peter’s meanness also shouldn’t be construed as a sign of evil. Much like Tinker Bell, Peter is just too small for big, complex feelings - or, rather, too young. Peter is described as being 'gay and innocent and heartless'. Since he all but raised himself in Neverland, he was never taught things like politeness and morals. His selfishness and cruelty are merely a result of completely unchecked childish behavior.
