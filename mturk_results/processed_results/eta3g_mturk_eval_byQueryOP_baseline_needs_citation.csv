The oxygen-rich blood from the lungs then enters the left atrium and is pumped to the left ventricle. The left ventricle generates the high pressure needed to pump the blood to your whole body through your blood vessels. When blood leaves the heart to go to the rest of the body, it travels through a large artery called the aorta. A balloon-like bulge, called an aortic aneurysm, can sometimes occur in the aorta.

Supplying oxygen to the heart’s muscle ', 'https://guides.hostos.cuny.edu/bio140/7-30\nThe pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood into the lungs from the heart, where it branches and eventually becomes the capillary network composed of pulmonary capillaries. These pulmonary capillaries create the respiratory membrane with the alveoli (Figure 2). As the blood is pumped through this capillary network, gas exchange occurs. Although a small amount of the oxygen is able to dissolve directly into plasma from the alveoli, most of the oxygen is picked up by erythrocytes (red blood cells) and binds to a protein called hemoglobin, a process described later in this chapter. \x1b[92m[3] Oxygenated hemoglobin is red, causing the overall appearance of bright red oxygenated blood, which returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins.\x1b[0m Carbon dioxide is released in the opposite direction of oxygen, from the blood to the alveoli. Some of the carbon dioxide is returned on hemoglobin, but can also be dissolved in plasma or is present as a converted form, also explained in greater detail later in this chapter.

Veins Veins carry blood toward the heart. After blood passes through the capillaries, it enters the smallest veins, called venules. From the venules, it flows into progressively larger and larger veins until it reaches the heart. \x1b[92m[0] In the pulmonary circuit, the pulmonary veins transport blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart.\x1b[0m This blood has a high oxygen content because it has just been oxygenated in the lungs. Systemic veins transport blood from the body tissue to the right atrium of the heart. This blood has a reduced oxygen content because the oxygen has been used for metabolic activities in the tissue cells.

The deoxygenated blood shoots down from the right atrium to the right ventricle. The heart then pumps it out of the right ventricle and into the pulmonary arteries to begin pulmonary circulation. The blood moves to the lungs, exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen, and returns to the left atrium.

(c) Reptiles also have two circulatory routes; however, blood is only oxygenated through the lungs (skin is not involved in oxygenation). The heart is three chambered, but the ventricles are partially separated. Some reptiles have an additional circuit that allows the blood to bypass the pulmonary (lung) circuit when the animal is underwater and no gas exchange can occur (shown in purple above).

While the scene, during which McCoy delivers a eulogy for Stone, seemed innocent at first, the episode connected Barba and Stone to position the long-time New York ADA's resignation.When McCoy and Peter talk the following day, he offers the ADA a spot in New York, but he says he's only in town long enough to get his father's affairs in order. They chat about how much Ben loved Peter, then the son goes into an empty courtroom and cries.The plot then shifts to a woman trying to find her son after he was kidnapped by her husband. The situation is resolved rather quickly — with the help of Olivia Benson's (Mariska Hargitay) hostage negotiation skills — but a twist keeps the storyline jolting forward.The child is virtually braindead, with no vision, hearing or the ability to breath on his own. His life is completely dependent on machines and his mother has been trying to obtain a court order to have him euthanized. The father, who could not follow through with the potential killing of the son, took the child to keep him alive.Barba is faced with the dilemma of charging the father with kidnapping, but as he talks to the mother and sees the child for himself, he agrees the child should be put to death. Barba, who is also haunted by guilty for selfishly keeping his father on life support rather than end his suffering, turns off the child's life support machines, killing the 10-month-old boy.He is then tried for murder by attorney Peter Stone, but is found not guilty after lengthy proceedings. After the trail, Barba chooses to resign and move on from his position against McCoy's wishes.Following the episode, Esparza confirmed that he would be exiting the show after six seasons.

Then Michael Moriarty completely self-destructed, and any issues that were caused all came to a head in an ugly slugfest between Moriarty, Dick Wolf and the producers, the suits at NBC, and the fucking United States federal government. Whether the story has a happy ending depends entirely on you, and your point of view. I’ll say this, it’s a happier ending than I thought it was. Which is a good thing, because back when I was that dope sick and emotionally disturbed person lying on that couch, the guy who I could kind of identify with was Ben. Like him, I’m a slightly soft spoken and somewhat socially awkward, but at the same time intelligent, deceptively tough, and highly empathetic, White guy of chiefly Irish-English descent with a receding hairline and something of a Charlie Brown face, though Stone is taller than me (at 6'3-6'4, Moriarty was considered one of the tallest actors in Hollywood in the ‘70s and ‘80s) and much more assertive than I am. His actor struggled with a psychological disorder and substance abuse problems for most of his adult life. Being in such a raw emotional state as I was during those times viewing the show on that couch, and relating to the character and the depression that hangs over his onscreen and off-screen exit as much as I did, it’s probably no surprise that of all the characters I’ve written about already and of all the ones I will do write-ups on in the future, my favorite is Ben Stone.

The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were the most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of US$50 billion. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released at the time of the games, the cost would not boost Russia's national economy, but could attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia as a result of improved services. But by December 2014, eight months after the games The Guardian stated that Sochi 'now feels like a ghost town', citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums and arenas and the still-unfinished infrastructure. \x1b[92m[2] At least four cities withdrew their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing the high costs or lack of local support, resulting in only a two-city race between Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China who hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics.\x1b[0m The Guardian stated that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is few cities or countries want to host them. Bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics became a two-city race between Paris and Los Angeles, so the IOC took the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles. Both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games\n\x1b[92m[6] The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games.\x1b[0m Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11 days) was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games. Although, it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years in the same year as their summer counterpart. This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.:\u200ap. 405 ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games\nThe evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in numerous changes to the Olympic Games. \x1b[92m[7] Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental Games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games.\x1b[0m The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC need to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World Wars I and II led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 restrictions.

About 21% of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen. This hasn't always been the case, though. Early in our planet's history, the atmosphere had almost no oxygen. Microbes that produce their food via photosynthesis generate oxygen as a by-product. Oxygen from photosynthetic microbes eventually built up in the atmosphere, drastically changing our planet's environment and the history of life in the process. Oxygen plays a critical role in respiration, the energy-producing chemistry that drives the metabolisms of most living things. \x1b[92m[0] We humans, along with many other creatures, need oxygen in the air we breathe to stay alive.\x1b[0m Oxygen is generated during photosynthesis by plants and many types of microbes.

Scientists around the world have found that the concentration of oxygen in our water and air is actually declining, says Prof. Andrew Babbin, an oceanographer and professor of chemical oceanography and marine microbiology at MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). Why? The biggest culprit is the burning of fossil fuels. \x1b[92m[1] First, let’s talk about the oxygen that’s in our air, which we and other animals breathe every day.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2701-oxygen\nOxygen means life Oxygen is vital for life. Most living things use oxygen for cellular respiration – the process by which cells obtain energy. \x1b[92m[3] Humans and other land animals breathe oxygen (as part of air) into lungs.\x1b[0m Here it is absorbed into the blood and carried to the body’s cells. Fish use gills to obtain dissolved oxygen from the water. Insects get their oxygen through small external openings called spiracles, which lead into a network of tubes called trachea. Plants also use oxygen for cellular respiration. In a separate process – photosynthesis – plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen. In low light, the photosynthesis rate is less than the respiration rate. In bright light, the photosynthesis rate is greater than the respiration rate and more oxygen is produced than used. The excess oxygen is released into the atmosphere.

Scientists know of only one process that could produce such large amounts of oxygen: photosynthesis. At the time that the planet was oxygenated, Earth was populated exclusively by single-celled organisms (Archaea and Bacteria), and only one of these can perform the sort of photosynthesis that splits a water molecule and results in oxygen gas: Cyanobacteria, whose blue-green color comes from chlorophyll. \x1b[92m[5] Today, Cyanobacteria can be found almost everywhere on Earth — likely right outside your door in the soil — and still play an important role in producing the oxygen that we breathe.\x1b[0m "", 'https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2701-oxygen\nOccurrence Oxygen is everywhere!

However, oxygen is very reactive. It easily combines with other elements. It is replenished by plants and other photosynthetic organisms. Oxygen also makes up most of Earth’s oceans by mass. \x1b[92m[7] A water molecule (H2O) is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\x1b[0m Although there are more hydrogen atoms in water, hydrogen has less mass.

When the earth was formed around 4.5 billion years ago, it had vastly different conditions. At that time, the earth had a reducing atmosphere, consisting of carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor, as opposed to the present-day atmosphere that consists primarily of nitrogen and oxygen. Though sunlight split the water vapor in the atmosphere into oxygen and hydrogen, the oxygen quickly reacted with methane and got locked into the earth’s crust, barely leaving any traces in the atmosphere. A silent, mysterious force worked to release oxygen steadily, until the very composition of the atmosphere changed. That mysterious entity happened to be a microbe: Cyanobacteria.

But as with everything, balance is key: too little nitrogen and plants cannot thrive, leading to low crop yields; but too much nitrogen can be toxic to plants, and can also harm our environment. Plants that do not have enough nitrogen become yellowish and do not grow well and can have smaller flowers and fruits. Farmers can add nitrogen fertilizer to produce better crops, but too much can hurt plants and animals, and pollute our aquatic systems.

28,584,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Community\nSouth Sudan's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, claimed publicly in October 2015 that, following evaluations and meetings of a special technical committee in May, June, August, September and October, the committee has recommended that South Sudan be allowed to join the East African Community. Those recommendations, however, had not been released to the public. It was reported that South Sudan could be admitted as early as November 2015 when the heads of East African States had their summit meeting. \x1b[92m[1] South Sudan was eventually approved for membership to the bloc in March 2016, and signed a treaty of accession in April 2016.\x1b[0m It had six months to ratify the agreement, which it did on 5 September, at which point it formally acceded to the community. It does not yet participate to the same extent as the other members.[timeframe?] Democratic Republic of the Congo's accession "", 'https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/SSD\nRelations with the international community and neighboring countries have been strained during the civil war. All neighboring countries have economic, political and strategic stakes in South Sudan and are, for this reason, directly or indirectly affected by the conflict. With multiple political conflicts within and among the states of the region, as well as recent political changes, it remains to be seen whether the new government of unity will be able to gain momentum and cooperate with its neighbors on the challenges ahead.After the start of the civil war in 2013, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) initiated and oversaw a mediation process. However, the neutrality of the IGAD’s efforts was compromised by the presence of the Ugandan army on South Sudanese soil. More broadly, a disconnection existed between the objectives of the regional IGAD body (which was responsible for the peace talks, as well as a monitoring and observation mission observing the earlier cease-fires) and those of the individual member states (each with their own interests). Following the new outbreak of violence in 2016, Ethiopia took the lead in IGAD’s mediation efforts. As a result of political changes in Ethiopia, the negotiations were handed over to Sudan, which exerted significant pressure on the opposition to agree to the peace deal. Khartoum found common ground with Kiir and supported a peace deal similar to the one in 2015, which favored the Kiir side. However, this changed once again after the revolution in Sudan, although Sudan has an interest in improving relations with South Sudan. Therefore, a window of opportunity exists for enhanced relations and cooperation in the region.South Sudan is an important trading partner, particularly for Uganda, but also for Kenya. Each of the neighbors has sought to further its own interests while pushing the regional body IGAD to find a permanent solution. At the moment, the instability in the country inhibits South Sudan’s potential economic role in the region. The country became a member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in 2011, but IGAD suspended South Sudan’s membership due to the country’s failure to pay its membership fee. \x1b[92m[0] In 2016, South Sudan joined the East African Community (EAC), but it did not send delegates to EAC meetings for several years.\x1b[0m The first delegates to the EAC were elected in September 2022. Within the EAC, there are discussions about ways to revitalize the landlocked state through new highways and oil pipelines, but these plans have been delayed for years due to the civil war. South Sudanese delegates often missed EAC meetings and did not pay fees to this organization either. However, since the conclusion of the peace deal and further driven by the necessity to cooperate on cross-border issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, South Sudan has appeared to be more willing to cooperate regionally than before.

Harrison co-wrote songs and music with Dylan, Clapton, Preston, Doris Troy, David Bromberg, Gary Wright, Wood, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty, among others.

Despite Lennon initially not convinced about George, he was allowed to join the band at just 14 years old. \x1b[92m[6] After a self-made recording of Buddy Holly covers, they moved from skiffle towards Rock and Roll causing all but John, Paul and George to leave and in 1960 they changed the name of the band for the final time to The Beatles.\x1b[0m From 1962 to 1965, Harold Hargreaves Harrison and his family which included George Harrison lived at 174 Macketts Lane, Liverpool while another George called George Rawlinson lived just nine doors away at 156 Macketts Lane with his mother, Esther and his father, also called George. \x1b[92m[5] During this period, The Beatles enjoyed huge success and developed into arguably the UK’s greatest band.\x1b[0m "", ""https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2021/03/case-for-prince\nThis was not a fluke.

This theory proposes that the story first formed during the 16th and 17th centuries when a large number of trials were being held throughout Europe in which men were accused of being werewolves who had molested or killed and eaten young children.

I say ‘wolf,' but there are various kinds of wolves. There are also those who are charming, quiet, polite, unassuming, complacent, and sweet, who pursue young women at home and in the streets.

65,536,"['https://byjus.com/physics/concave-convex-mirrors/\nMagnification and Image Formation: When a concave mirror is placed very close to the object, it forms a magnified, erect, and virtual image. The image appears larger than the actual object and is upright. The virtual image is formed as the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point behind the mirror. Changing Distance and Image Properties: As the distance between the object and the concave mirror increases, the size of the image decreases. Eventually, at a certain distance, the image transitions from virtual to real. In this case, a real and inverted image is formed on the opposite side of the mirror. \x1b[92m[4] Versatile Image Formation: Concave mirrors have the ability to create images that can vary in size, from small to large, and in nature, from real to virtual.\x1b[0m These characteristics make concave mirrors useful in various applications such as telescopes, shaving mirrors, and reflecting headlights. Convex Mirror Definition ', 'https://byjus.com/physics/concave-convex-mirrors/\nA concave mirror is a curved mirror where the reflecting surface is on the inner side of the curved shape. It has a surface that curves inward, resembling the shape of the inner surface of a hollow sphere. Concave mirrors are also converging mirrors because they cause light rays to converge or come together after reflection. \x1b[92m[2] Depending on the position of the object and the mirror, concave mirrors can form both real and virtual images.\x1b[0m Characteristics of Concave Mirrors Converging Mirror: A concave mirror is often referred to as a converging mirror because when light rays strike and reflect from its reflecting surface, they converge or come together at a specific point known as the focal point. This property of concave mirrors allows them to focus light to a point. ', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concave-and-convex-mirrors/\n\x1b[92m[0] The image formed by the concave mirror can be small or enlarged or can be either real or virtual.\x1b[0m Applications of Concave Mirrors Used in shaving mirrors: Converging mirrors are most widely used in shaving because they have reflective and curved surfaces. At the time of shaving, the concave mirror forms an enlarged as well as erect image of the face when the concave mirror is held closer to the face. The concave mirror used in the ophthalmoscope: These mirrors are used in optical instruments as in ophthalmoscopes for treatment. Uses of the concave mirrors in astronomical telescopes: These mirrors are also widely used in making astronomical telescopes. In an astronomical telescope, a converging mirror of a diameter of about 5 meters or more is used as the objective.

After this stinging defeat for the Union, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, the commander of the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia, was relieved and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who set about reorganizing and training what would become the Army of the Potomac.In contextAlthough the Civil War officially began when Confederate troops shelled Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, the fighting didn’t commence in earnest until the Battle of Bull Run, fought months later in Virginia, just 25 miles from Washington D.C. Under public pressure to end the war in 90 days, President Lincoln had pushed the cautious Gen. McDowell to embark on a campaign to capture the Confederate capital in Richmond, but McDowell’s troops were stopped at Bull Run by Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard’s Rebel forces.

79,477,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading\nSeafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate slab pull at subduction zones, rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. Plates that are not subducting are driven by gravity sliding off the elevated mid-ocean ridges a process called ridge push. \x1b[92m[1] At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed.\x1b[0m Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone.

Every few hundred thousand years the earthŌĆÖs magnetic field reverses, in a process known as geomagnetic reversal. Some bands of rock were produced during a time when the polarity of the earthŌĆÖs magnetic field was the reverse of its current polarity. Geomagnetic reversal allows scientists to study the movement of ocean floors over time. ┬Ā ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics\nTectonic plates are relatively rigid and float across the ductile asthenosphere beneath. Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection currents, the slow creeping motion of Earth's solid mantle. \x1b[92m[3] At a seafloor spreading ridge, plates move away from the ridge, which is a topographic high, and the newly formed crust cools as it moves away, increasing its density and contributing to the motion.\x1b[0m At a subduction zone the relatively cold, dense oceanic crust sinks down into the mantle, forming the downward convecting limb of a mantle cell, which is the strongest driver of plate motion. The relative importance and interaction of other proposed factors such as active convection, upwelling inside the mantle, and tidal drag of the Moon is still the subject of debate. Key principles "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading\nSeafloor spreading, or seafloor spread, is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. History of study Earlier theories by Alfred Wegener and Alexander du Toit of continental drift postulated that continents in motion 'plowed' through the fixed and immovable seafloor. The idea that the seafloor itself moves and also carries the continents with it as it spreads from a central rift axis was proposed by Harold Hammond Hess from Princeton University and Robert Dietz of the U.S. Naval Electronics Laboratory in San Diego in the 1960s.

Later, a large-scale rebellion broke out in May and turned into what may be called a full-fledged war in the affected region. \x1b[92m[5] This war brought about the end of the British East India Company’s rule in India, and led to the direct rule by the British Government (British Raj) of much of the Indian Subcontinent for the next 90 years.\x1b[0m ', 'https://unacademy.com/content/nda/study-material/indian-history/causes-of-1857-revolt/\nThe 1857 revolt was a turning point in the history of India. \x1b[92m[0] It was a result of years of discontent among the people against British rule.\x1b[0m There were many factors that contributed to this uprising, and it is important to understand all of them if we want to gain a better understanding of this important event. \x1b[92m[2] In this article, we will explore the causes of the 1857 revolt in detail and try to get a clearer picture of what led to this momentous event.A Short Note 0n Revolt of 1857The revolt of 1857 was the first major challenge to British rule in India.\x1b[0m It broke out on May 11, 1857, at Meerut, a small town near Delhi. Soon it spread to other parts of the country and became a full-fledged rebellion against the British. The main aim of the rebels was to drive the British out of India.The revolt was crushed after a long and hard-fought battle, but it left a deep impact on the course of Indian history. \x1b[92m[1] \x1b[92m[3] \x1b[92m[4] It showed the people of India that they could unitedly challenge British rule and also inspired future generations to fight for independence.\x1b[0m\x1b[0mCauses of Revolt of 1857The 1857 revolt was caused by a number of factors, both immediate and long term.\x1b[0m The following are some of the most important causes of the revolt:The Policy of AnnexationOne of the main reasons for the outbreak of the revolt was the policy of annexation pursued by the British. This policy led to the annexation of several native states, which made the people feel that their rights were being usurped.The Doctrine of LapseThe Doctrine of Lapse was another major cause of the revolt. This doctrine allowed the British to annex any native state whose ruler died without a male heir. This led to great unrest among the people, as they felt that their rights were being snatched away.Discrimination against IndiansThe British policy of discrimination against Indians was another important factor that led to the revolt. The British favoured Europeans over Indians in all aspects of life, which led to a feeling of resentment among the people.The Economic Policies of the BritishThe economic policies of the British also contributed to the outbreak of the revolt. The tax policies and other measures adopted by the British led to economic hardship for the people, which made them resentful of British rule.The Social Policies of the BritishThe social policies of the British also played a role in causing the revolt. The policy of introducing western education and culture led to a feeling of alienation among the people.Greased CartilagesThe introduction of greased cartridges was the immediate cause of the revolt. The cartridges used in the new rifles had to be greased with tallow, which is a substance derived from animal fat. This led to great resentment among the Hindu and Muslim soldiers, as they felt that this was against their religious beliefs.The rebellion was thus caused by a combination of factors, both immediate and long term. It is important to understand all of these factors if we want to get a clear picture of this historic event.Aftermath of the RevoltThe revolt of 1857 was a turning point in the history of India. \x1b[92m[3] \x1b[92m[4] It showed the people of India that they could unitedly challenge British rule and also inspired future generations to fight for independence.\x1b[0m\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] The revolt also led to a number of changes in British policy, which made the people feel that their rights were being safeguarded.The revolt of 1857 was thus a significant event in the history of India, and it is important to understand all its causes and effects.ConclusionThe 1857 revolt was caused by a number of factors, chief among them the increasing power of the British East India Company and the resentment it bred in Indian subjects.\x1b[0m The company’s monopoly on trade, its exemption from taxation, and its ever-growing landholdings created great inequality and injustice. In addition, British policies such as the Doctrine of Lapse and the Vernacular Press Act further angered Indians. Students studying this period should be aware of all these causes to gain a complete understanding of one of India’s most significant uprisings.

94,556,"[""https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/10-facts-french-and-indian-war\nThe French and Indian War remains a crucial but often forgotten piece of American history. Here are 10 facts about the French and Indian War, a conflict that is often regarded as a spark that led to the American Revolution. Fact #1: It was part of a global warThe French and Indian War refers to the North American theater of the overarching global war known as the Seven Years' War in Europe. \x1b[92m[0] The French and Indian War was fought between Great Britain and France and their colonists, as well as Native American tribes.\x1b[0m They fought over territories and expansion throughout North America.Fact #2: George Washington essentially set off the war in North America In 1754, Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, a 22 year old commander of British forces set off with his men towards the coveted Ohio River Valley to assist in building a fort. A small French company of soldiers led by Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville departed French Fort Duquesne to scout intelligence about British movements. When young Washington became aware of the French movement, he set out with his party to meet them, and ambushed them near Great Meadows in Pennsylvania. When the two sides met, Washington ordered his troops to fire, igniting a battle that resulted in the death of Ensign de Jumonville and 9 other French soldiers. After this battle, the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington moved his men into the Great Meadows, an open field, and crudely constructed Fort Necessity as a base. A few weeks later, French forces surrounded the British at Fort Necessity, forcing George Washington to surrender and unknowingly, due to poor translation, sign a document admitting to the assassination of Ensign de Jumonville.

96,530,"['https://opengeology.org/textbook/3-minerals/\nPrecipitation is the reverse process, in which ions in solution come together to form solid minerals. Precipitation is dependent on the concentration of ions in solution and other factors such as temperature and pressure. The point at which a solvent cannot hold any more solute is called saturation. \x1b[92m[0] Precipitation can occur when the temperature of the solution falls, when the solute evaporates, or with changing chemical conditions in the solution.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] An example of precipitation in our homes is when water evaporates and leaves behind a rind of minerals on faucets, shower heads, and drinking glasses.\x1b[0m ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain\nA wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually, their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. \x1b[92m[3] What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as ice pellets and snow, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground.\x1b[0m If there is a shallow near-surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result. Hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds 3,400 m (11,000 ft) above ground level. Convection Convective precipitation Orographic precipitation ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain\nThe major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. \x1b[92m[4] If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands.\x1b[0m In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes. ', 'https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/how-weather-works/weather-fronts\nSometimes a cold front follows right behind a warm front. \x1b[92m[5] A warm air mass pushes into a colder air mass (the warm front), and then another cold air mass pushes into the warm air mass (the cold front).\x1b[0m Because cold fronts move faster, the cold front is likely to overtake the warm front. This is known as an occluded front. At an occluded front, the cold air mass from the cold front meets the cool air that was ahead of the warm front. The warm air rises as these air masses come together. Occluded fronts usually form around areas of low atmospheric pressure. There is often precipitation along an occluded front from cumulonimbus or nimbostratus clouds. Wind changes direction as the front passes and the temperature either warms or cools. After the front passes, the sky is usually clearer, and the air is drier. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain\n\x1b[92m[1] The main ways water vapor is added to the air are wind convergence into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains.\x1b[0m Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.

Let me explain: There are three types of mammals, differentiated by the ways they reproduce. Humans, dogs, elephants, lions, tigers, bears, and many other mammals are placental mammals. Placentals reproduce by gestating their young inside a uterus, where the young are nourished by the placenta tissue via an umbilical cord. It’s a common reproductive method, used by the majority of living mammal species. Marsupials, however, do things a little bit differently. \x1b[92m[3] Young develop inside their mother in a uterus (or two) for a short time, but they are born early and finish developing inside a special pouch.\x1b[0m (More on that later.)

The lipid tails of one layer face the lipid tails of the other layer, meeting at the interface of the two layers. The phospholipid heads face outward, one layer exposed to the interior of the cell and one layer exposed to the exterior (Figure 3.3). Because the phosphate groups are polar and hydrophilic, they are attracted to water in the intracellular fluid. Intracellular fluid (ICF) is the fluid interior of the cell. The phosphate groups are also attracted to the extracellular fluid. Extracellular fluid (ECF) is the fluid environment outside the enclosure of the cell membrane. \x1b[92m[3] Interstitial fluid (IF) is the term given to extracellular fluid not contained within blood vessels.\x1b[0m Because the lipid tails are hydrophobic, they meet in the inner region of the membrane, excluding watery intracellular and extracellular fluid from this space. The cell membrane has many proteins, as well as other lipids (such as cholesterol), that are associated with the phospholipid bilayer.

Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance (osmotic balance) across membranes within the body’s fluids, which are composed of water plus electrolytes and non-electrolytes. An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water. A non-electrolyte, in contrast, does not dissociate into ions during water dissolution. Both electrolytes and non-electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance. \x1b[92m[0] The body’s fluids include blood plasma, the cytosol within cells, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body.\x1b[0m The membranes of the body (such as the pleural, serous, and cell membranes) are semi-permeable: they allow passage of certain types of solutes and water, but not others. Solutions on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by movement of solutes and/or water across the membrane.

Thus, only about 7-8% of total body water is intravascular. The composition of the ECF is what we measure when we obtain a set of electrolytes. The sodium content of the ECF is approximately 140 mEq/l, and the potassium is only 4-5 mEq/l. The predominant anions in the extracellular fluid are chloride and bicarbonate. The composition of the intracellular fluid (ICF) is dramatically different. Whereas there is a very small concentration of potassium in the extracellular fluid, the predominant cation of the intracellular fluid is potassium with an intracellular concentration of 140 mEq/l. The intracellular chloride concentration is very low in most cells. The bulk of the anions in the intracellular compartment is made up of charges on proteins and other impermeant molecules. II.

Osmosis. Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane down its concentration gradient. If a membrane is permeable to water, though not to a solute, water will equalize its own concentration by diffusing to the side of lower water concentration (and thus the side of higher solute concentration). In the beaker on the left, the solution on the right side of the membrane is hypertonic. \x1b[92m[1] The movement of water molecules is not itself regulated by cells, so it is important that cells are exposed to an environment in which the concentration of solutes outside of the cells (in the extracellular fluid) is equal to the concentration of solutes inside the cells (in the cytoplasm).\x1b[0m Tonicity is used to describe the variations of solute in a solution with the solute inside the cell.  Three terms—hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic—are used to compare the relative solute concentration of a cell to that of the extracellular fluid surrounding the cells.

120,442,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest\nTropical rainforests are located around and near the equator, therefore having what is called an equatorial climate characterized by three major climatic parameters: temperature, rainfall, and dry season intensity. Other parameters that affect tropical rainforests are carbon dioxide concentrations, solar radiation, and nitrogen availability. In general, climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. \x1b[92m[0] However, the abundance of rainfall changes throughout the year creating distinct moist and dry seasons.\x1b[0m Tropical forests are classified by the amount of rainfall received each year, which has allowed ecologists to define differences in these forests that look so similar in structure. According to Holdridge's classification of tropical ecosystems, true tropical rainforests have an annual rainfall greater than 2 m and annual temperature greater than 24 degrees Celsius, with a potential evapotranspiration ratio (PET) value of <0.25. However, most lowland tropical forests can be classified as tropical moist or wet forests, which differ in regards to rainfall. Tropical forest ecology- dynamics, composition, and function- are sensitive to changes in climate especially changes in rainfall.

Get to know ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest\n\x1b[92m[1] Moist seasonal tropical forests receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season.\x1b[0m These forests usually fall under tropical monsoon or tropical savanna climates. Some trees in these forests drop some or all of their leaves during the winter dry season, thus they are sometimes called 'tropical mixed forest'. They are found in parts of South America, in Central America and around the Caribbean, in coastal West Africa, parts of the Indian subcontinent, and across much of Indochina. Montane rainforests These are found in cooler-climate mountainous areas, becoming known as cloud forests at higher elevations. Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between 1500 and 2500 m while the upper limit is usually from 2400 to 3300 m. Flooded rainforests Tropical freshwater swamp forests, or 'flooded forests', are found in Amazon basin (the Várzea) and elsewhere.

For certain matters, such as patent and copyright infringement disputes and prosecutions for federal crimes, the jurisdiction of the district courts is exclusive of that of the state courts, meaning that only federal courts can hear those cases.[note 2] "", ""https://judiciallearningcenter.org/state-courts-vs-federal-courts/\nMost criminal activity falls in this category, such as robbery, assault, murder, and many drug-related crimes. \x1b[92m[1] A controversy arising out of the state constitution or other state laws.\x1b[0m A case in which the state is a party, such as state tax violations.

All did a fine job with what they'd been given--and all the characters seemed to have meaty personal conflicts to deal with--but the basic plot line was as poor as the initial series had been excellent. The plot felt hastily thrown together and contrived, as if the goal was simply to create crises and personal trauma. What made it frustrating for me was in order to get the characters in the conflicts, they had to behave illogically or stupidly. They couldn't follow basic police procedure, because then there would be no conflict. It was as if the whole series had been dumbed down. \x1b[92m[3] It felt like it had been transformed into a typical American tv detective series, where the main character is built up--every week he undergoes some challenge (physical or emotional), so that he can overcome it and show himself to be a heroic figure.\x1b[0m This was shame because the first series had been so exceptional.

Unfortunately mediocre, this series substitutes convolution for complexity and melodrama for psychodrama, drags out the suspenseful moments, doddles through the not-so-suspenseful moments, and never really digs into the minds or the guts of its protags. Obvious and contrived and lacking the edge of 'Wire in the Blood', the personality of 'Cracker', the realism of 'Prime Suspect', or the complexity of 'Foyle's War', this series is more sizzle than steak. \x1b[92m[4] Entertaining but not all it tries to be, 'Touching Evil' smells a bit too much like a pretentious and simple minded Hollywood soap opera.\x1b[0m (B-) "", ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118497/reviews\n\x1b[92m[0] 'Touching Evil' is such a wonderful series, but sometimes it's difficult to watch.\x1b[0m It's dark, gritty, atmospheric, sometimes sad, and sometimes heartbreaking. Bottom line: it's fantastic.The series stars heartthrob Robson Green, a quirky, intense, sexy actor who, in his role as Dave Creegan. Creegan is a divorced man with two beautiful little girls; his wife is involved with someone else. Previous to the series, he was shot and had a near death experience, which has affected him deeply as well as leaving him with a physical scar.When the series begins, he comes to work with the Organised & Serial Crime Unit, where he's teamed with Susan Taylor (Nicola Walker), an attractive, down to earth woman who realizes early on that Creegan is no typical detective. He works to get into the mind of the killer to figure out his next move.The various episodes have dealt with child kidnapping, euthanasia, murders resulting from a web game, a serial killer who communicates with a reporter, and PTSD. At one point, Creegan realizes that he must take desperate measures to protect his ex-wife and his family.Really excellent series, with absolutely no glamor, sometimes bizarrely photographed, dealing with Britain's underside.

The title of the play, R.U.R., stood for 'Rossum's Universal Robots,' a fictional company that manufactured robots. These humanlike machines were supposed to perform all the hard, dull, and dangerous work for people, but they finally became resentful and rebelled, killing all humans. \x1b[92m[0] Čapek formed the word robot from the Czech robota, meaning 'forced labor.'\x1b[0m The play was very popular and influential. As a result, the word robot came to have several meanings, including 'a human being who has become brutal and insensitive or machinelike because of overwork and mistreatment.'

', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration\nSubsequent to the decision, the remainder of Title I was extended until April 1, 1936, by joint resolution of Congress (49 Stat. 375), June 14, 1935, and NRA was reorganized by E.O. 7075, June 15, 1935, to facilitate its new role as a promoter of industrial cooperation and to enable it to produce a series of economic studies, which the National Recovery Review Board was already doing. Many of the labor provisions reappeared in the Wagner Act of 1935. Legacy The NRA tried to end the Great Depression by organizing thousands of businesses under codes drawn up by trade associations and industries. \x1b[92m[2] Hugh Johnson proved charismatic in setting up publicity that glorified his new NRA.\x1b[0m Johnson was recognized for his efforts when Time named him Man of the Year of 1933—choosing him instead of FDR. ', ""https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/national-industrial-recovery-act\nOn June 16, 1933, this act established the National Recovery Administration, which supervised fair trade codes and guaranteed laborers a right to collective bargaining. \x1b[92m[4] The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was enacted by Congress in June 1933 and was one of the measures by which President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to assist the nation's economic recovery during the Great Depression.\x1b[0m The passage of NIRA ushered in a unique experiment in U.S. economic history – the NIRA sanctioned, supported, and in some cases, enforced an alliance of industries. Antitrust laws were suspended, and companies were required to write industry-wide 'codes of fair competition' that effectively fixed prices and wages, established production quotas, and imposed restrictions on entry of other companies into the alliances. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration\n\x1b[92m[1] The first director of the NRA was Hugh S. Johnson, a retired United States Army general who had been in charge of supervising the wartime economy in 1917–1918.\x1b[0m He was named Time magazine's 'Man of the Year' in 1933. Johnson saw the NRA as a national crusade designed to restore employment and regenerate industry. Johnson called on every business establishment in the nation to accept a stopgap 'blanket code': a minimum wage of between 20 and 45 cents per hour, a maximum workweek of 35 to 45 hours, and the abolition of child labor. Johnson and Roosevelt contended that the 'blanket code' would raise consumer purchasing power and increase employment. Historian Clarence B.

Why not just mass produce one message that could be sent out en masse?

Horsley went to work, and, by December, 1843, he had come up with the prototype for the first commercial Christmas card.

In 1857, the U.S. Mint added nickel to the copper to cut cost, as the cost of copper was rising. In 1864, the Mint switched to tin and zinc (bronze) instead of nickel. In 1943, pennies were made of zinc-coated steel. Copper had become essential to the war effort during World War II. The Mint accidentally made 40 copper pennies, which have become highly sought-after collectibles. The record amount paid for a 1943 copper cent was $204,000 in 2019.

After 1864, the penny was made of bronze. Bronze is 95% copper and 5% zinc and tin. For one year, 1943, the penny had no copper in it due to the expense of the World War II. It was just zinc coated steel. After 1943 until 1982, the penny went through periods where it was brass or bronze. Today, the penny in America is 2.5% copper with 97.5% zinc.

Inflation has destroyed the value of nickels and dimes as well as pennies. And in some cases, they cost more than they are worth (nickels) and are money losers for the Mint (nickels, again). We could easily get rid of pennies, nickels, and dimes and be no more inconvenienced than the average person in 1913. Our pockets would be lighter by not having to make the additional change. Time spent at the register would be less without having to count out dimes, nickels, and pennies. And no one would have to wonder where to cash in coins. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which pennies are worth money? All pennies are worth money, but some have become collectible. Collectors may seek out coins that were minted under unusual circumstances or with outdated designs, thus adding value to some pennies. \x1b[92m[5] When did pennies stop being made of copper?\x1b[0m ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc\n\x1b[92m[1] In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but containing primarily zinc.\x1b[0m Zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1 kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12 grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins. ', 'https://www.money.org/explore-the-world-of-money-scouts-hints-for-completing-the-boy-scout-badge-requirements/\nThe metal used to make coins starts in a solid form called an ingot. This ingot is then fed into a rolling mill that exerts pressure and the ingot bar is reduced in thickness from over six inches to a long strip of metal the thickness of the final coin. Since 1965, U.S. dimes, quarters, half dollars, and dollars have been made from a core of copper, layered between and bonded to two thinner outer layers of copper-nickel (except the current Sacagawea dollar). \x1b[92m[2] Cents since 1982 have been made of a zinc core plated with copper.\x1b[0m Once the strips, called coils, are rolled to the proper thickness, they are about 13 inches wide and over 1,500 feet in length. They are then fed through a blanking press, which punches out circular discs, called blanks.

205,579,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastema\nA diastema (pl.\x1b[92m[2] : diastemata, from Greek διάστημα, 'space') is a space or gap between two teeth.\x1b[0m Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. More colloquially, the condition may be referred to as gap teeth or tooth gap. \x1b[92m[4] In humans, the term is most commonly applied to an open space between the upper incisors (front teeth).\x1b[0m It happens when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. In humans Causes 1. Oversized Labial Frenulum: Diastema is sometimes caused or exacerbated by the action of a labial frenulum (the tissue connecting the lip to the gum), causing high mucosal attachment and less attached keratinized tissue. This is more prone to recession or by tongue thrusting, which can push the teeth apart. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastema\n2. Periodontal Disease: Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, can result in bone loss that supports the teeth. If a person loses enough bone, the teeth can become loose and cause gaps to form. 3. Mesiodens: Mesiodens is an extra tooth that grows behind the front teeth. \x1b[92m[1] A mesiodens may push the front teeth apart to make room for itself thus creating a gap between the front teeth.\x1b[0m 4. Skeletal discrepancy: Dental skeletal discrepancy can be a cause behind gap teeth. If the upper jaw grows more than the lower jaw, teeth on the upper jaw will have more space to cover thus leaving gaps between them. 5. \x1b[92m[3] Proclination: If the front teeth are angled forward, a small gap between them may appear large.\x1b[0m This is called proclination; it may be a result of aggressive tongue thrusting. Treatment A diastema is not a pathology and doesn't require treatment. Any interventions to modify a diastema are purely cosmetic. 1. Determine the cause of the diastema, then treat the cause. "", 'https://www.briteorthodontics.com/blog/malocclusion-and-its-treatment/\nOverlapping on lower teeth to some extent is normal, but when this takes an abnormal form, it causes overbite. Your upper front teeth may bite down on your gums, or your lower front teeth may bite the roof of your mouth. Underbite An underbite which is also known as anterior crossbite occurs when your lower front teeth protrude far from your upper front teeth. Crossbite A crossbite can occur on either side of your jaw, front, or back teeth. When you suffer from a crossbite, your upper teeth bite inside your lower teeth. \x1b[92m[0] Diastema Generally known as gapping teeth, a diastema is a dental condition in which a space occurs between two adjacent teeth.\x1b[0m These teeth are most commonly the front two teeth.

By sundown, all Massachusetts beyond Boston was in open revolt. Hancock and Adams had new moral authority thanks to Gage’s botched attempt to have them arrested—probably for transportation to treason trials in England.

The retina is actually a part of the brain itself that extends into the eyes and connects to the rest of the brain via the optic nerves, one for each eye. \x1b[92m[2] The optic nerve is formed by the axons of the retinal ganglion cell neurons that form the last layer of the retina.\x1b[0m Axons are the long projections that connect a neuron to other down stream neurons. In the retina most neuron types do not have axons because the physical distances over which signals need to travel are short, but ganglion cells have long axons that project to the other parts of the visual system in the brain. \x1b[92m[0] All the ganglion cell axons bundled together form the optic nerve, one for each eye.\x1b[0m (In reality the optic nerves are misnamed, they are not actually nerves but central white matter tracts because they are part of the brain proper- the term 'nerve' is reserved for bundles of axons in the peripheral nervous system.) Photons enter the eye through the pupil and are focused onto the retina by the optics of the eye, the cornea and lens. Incoming photons are 'absorbed' by the first layer of specialized retinal neurons called photoreceptor neurons. These are the neurons in which phototransduction takes place, the transduction process of converting light into the language of the brain.

The central ganglion cell fibers run around the foveal slope and sweep in the direction of the optic nerve.  Peripheral ganglion cell axons continue this arcing course to the optic nerve with a dorso/ventral split along the horizontal meridian (Fig. 00).  Retinal topography is maintained in the optic nerve, through the lateral geniculate to the visual cortex. Fig. 00.  Schematic representation of the course of ganglion cell axons in the retina.  The retinotopic origin of these nerve fibers is respected throughout the visual pathway.  (Modified from Harrington DO, Drake MV.  The visual fields.  6th ed.

The ganglion cells originating temporal to the macula must also travel to the optic disc without crossing the median raphe. To do so they must arc around the papillomacular bundle, forming the appropriately named arcuate fibers. Ganglion cells originating in the areas of the retina nasal to the disc do not have to arc around the macula. They are therefore oriented radially, making a fairly straight path to the optic nerve. Visual field defects resulting from ganglion cell loss, such as those from glaucoma, correspond to these anatomical patterns.

Sensory information from the eyeball itself, carrying for example, touch, pain, and pressure information, is conveyed via the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Thus a total of 5 of the 12 cranial nerves (CN 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) play a role in eye and visual function. \x1b[92m[3] Recall that the neural components of the eye (retina and optic nerve) are derived from the central nervous system, so the retina contains not just the photoreceptors that transduce light, but also contains the complicated circuitry that begins to process visual information before the axons of the retinal ganglion cells leave the eyeball to form the optic nerve.\x1b[0m Review the layers of the retina and label them here. Recall that this initial part of the visual pathway is photoreceptor⇒bipolar cell⇒retinal ganglion cell.

This region of the retina is devoid of receptor cells and composed predominantly by the optic nerve layer. Consequently, it is the structural basis for the 'blind spot' in the visual field.

The Photoreceptors The human has two types of photoreceptors: "", 'https://eyewiki.org/Optic_Atrophy\nAnything that can compromise ganglion cell function can cause (over time) optic atrophy (and more broadly optic neuropathy). Optic atrophy can occur due to damage within the eye (glaucoma, optic neuritis, papilledema, etc.), along the path of the optic nerve to the brain (tumor, neurodegenerative disorder, trauma, etc.), or it can be congenital (Leber’s hereditary optic atrophy, autosomal dominant optic atrophy). Risk Factors Risk factors run the gamut from increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma), ischemia, compression (tumors), inflammation, infection, etc. See differential diagnosis below. \x1b[92m[4] General Pathology The optic nerve is a bundle of 1.2 million axons of retinal ganglion cells that carries visual information from the retina to the brain.\x1b[0m The optic nerve is myelinated by oligodendrocytes that do not regenerate after damage. In optic nerve atrophy there is loss of axons and shrinkage of myelin leading to gliosis and widening of the optic cup. Primary prevention ', 'https://byjus.com/neet/what-are-the-three-primary-layers-of-retina/\nAlso see: Difference between Rods and Cones Bipolar Cell Layer They constitute the middle layer and receive the signal from photoreceptor cells. The bipolar cells synapse with both rods and cones and ganglion cells. They transmit the signal from photoreceptor cells to ganglion cells. Apart from bipolar cells, there are two types of lateral interneurons present in the middle layer, namely horizontal cells and amacrine cells. They help in relaying information within the retina. Horizontal cells – they receive impulses from photoreceptor cells and transmit it to bipolar cells. Amacrine cells – they relay information between bipolar cells or from bipolar cells to ganglion cells. Ganglion cell layer Ganglion cells receive signals from bipolar cells. \x1b[92m[5] The axons of ganglion cells unite to form optic nerve, which transmits the signal to thalamus for further processing by the brain.\x1b[0m The visual cortex area of the brain processes the nerve impulses and the image is recognised.

This partial crossing at the chiasm brings together all the information from one visual field to be processed by the opposite thalamus and cortex. The vast majority of axons in the optic tract synapse in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, which in turn projects through direct radiations and through Meyer’s loop to the primary visual cortex in the banks of the calcarine fissure. This is the pathway that underlies conscious visual perception. Study the image and click on the 'i' symbols for more information.

This led to the Bangladesh Liberation War in March 1971. Yahya Khan was central to the perpetration of Bangladesh genocide, in which around 300,000–3,000,000 Bengalis were killed, and between 200,000 to 400,000 women were raped. In December 1971, Pakistan carried out pre-emptive strikes against the Bengali-allied Indian Army, culminating in the start of the Third India–Pakistan War. The wars resulted in the surrender of the Pakistani armed forces in East Pakistan, and East Pakistan seceded as Bangladesh. After the surrender, Khan resigned from the military command and transferred the presidency to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Khan remained under house surveillance prior to 1979 when he was released by Fazle Haq. Khan died the following year in Rawalpindi and was buried in Peshawar. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan\nWhen the news of Pakistan's surrender was broadcast by West Pakistani media, the spontaneous and overwhelming public anger over the nation's defeat by Bangladeshi rebels and the Indian Army, and over the breskup of Pakistan into two parts, boiled into street demonstrations throughout Pakistan. Rumors of an impending coup d'état by junior military officers against President Yahya Khan swept the country. \x1b[92m[1] To forestall further unrest, on 20 December 1971, he handed over the presidency and government to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the ambitious leader of the (at that time) powerful and popular People's Party.\x1b[0m Yahya became the highest-ranking official in what remained of Pakistan to be forced out due to the war.

Chart performance "", ""Share on FacebookShare on Twitter'She’s Always a Woman' is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful songs in Billy Joel’s repertoire. The Gordon Lightfoot inspired love ballad appears on Billy Joel’s fifth studio album 'The Stranger' and was released as a single in 1978. But what’s the story and meaning behind the song? Let’s find out!The Meaning of She’s Always a Woman'She’s Always a Woman' is about Billy Joel’s first wife Elizabeth Weber. Besides being Joel’s wife, she was also his manager. A woman as a manager was a unique occurrence in the music industry of the 1970s. And as a result, a lot of men in the music industry considered Elizabeth to be 'Unfeminine' and 'Tough'. Billy Joel wrote the song to defend his wife. He implies that Elizabeth may be 'tough' and 'unfeminine' to people in the industry, but she’s always a woman to him. The song is often misunderstood as misogynistic, beyond Joel’s understanding. In Fred Schruers’ book Billy Joel, he said: 'My take was ‘She can ruin your faith with her casual lies/and she only reveals what she wants you to see’ — all second person — but then it comes back to me: ‘She’s always a woman to me.' He later said in an interview: 'To me, it’s a very simple understandable lyric. She may be that to you, but she’s this to me.'Nowadays, 'She’s Always a Woman' is often interpreted as an honest love song. As a song that declares love to a woman, despite her imperfections.Billy Joel By Rob Mieremet / Anefo – CC0,Billy Joel and Elizabeth WeberAs said earlier, the song was written for Joel’s first wife Elizabeth Weber. Weber was initially married to a band member of Billy Joel, drummer Jon Small. Captivated by her intelligence and straightforwardness, Billy Joel started an affair with her. When Small found out about their affair, he decided to end his partnership with Joel. Weber initially decided to leave Billy Joel too, which made him suicidal. She later returned to him.Read more: The 10 Best Billy Joel Songs of All Time Billy Joel and Elizabeth Weber married in September 1973. She was the inspiration behind Billy Joel’s 'Just The Way You Are' and 'She’s Always a Woman'. These love ballads couldn’t save Joel’s marriage and they eventually went through a rough divorce in 1982.At the end of the 70s, 'Just The Way You Are' and 'She’s Always a Woman' were staples in Billy Joel’s live shows. But after his divorce from Elizabeth Weber, he scrapped the songs from the setlist. Joel stated that he lost the passion to play the songs. In recent years he brought 'She’s Always a Woman' back on the setlist, often stating 'And then we got divorced' at the end of the song.The Song’s Legacy'She’s Always a Woman' appears on Billy Joel’s fifth studio album 'The Stranger' and was released as a single in 1978. The song peaked at number 17 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also reached the charts in Canada, Belgium, and The Netherlands. In 1986, 'She’s Always a Woman' entered the UK charts when the song was released as a double A-side with 'Just the Way You Are'. In 2010 the song reached the UK charts again due to a cover by Fyfe Dangerfield. Joel’s original eventually reached number 29 on the UK singles chart.Tags: billy joelmeaningshe's always a womanstory "", ""The song made a remarkable comeback in 2010, charting again at #29 in the UK charts when Fyfe Dangerfield's abridged cover version of it was used in a commercial for the UK retailer John Lewis.

Chart performance "", ""https://songstoriesmatter.com/shes-always-a-woman-by-billy-joel-story/\nShare on FacebookShare on Twitter'She’s Always a Woman' is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful songs in Billy Joel’s repertoire. The Gordon Lightfoot inspired love ballad appears on Billy Joel’s fifth studio album 'The Stranger' and was released as a single in 1978. But what’s the story and meaning behind the song? Let’s find out!The Meaning of She’s Always a Woman'She’s Always a Woman' is about Billy Joel’s first wife Elizabeth Weber. Besides being Joel’s wife, she was also his manager. A woman as a manager was a unique occurrence in the music industry of the 1970s. And as a result, a lot of men in the music industry considered Elizabeth to be 'Unfeminine' and 'Tough'. Billy Joel wrote the song to defend his wife. He implies that Elizabeth may be 'tough' and 'unfeminine' to people in the industry, but she’s always a woman to him. The song is often misunderstood as misogynistic, beyond Joel’s understanding. In Fred Schruers’ book Billy Joel, he said: 'My take was ‘She can ruin your faith with her casual lies/and she only reveals what she wants you to see’ — all second person — but then it comes back to me: ‘She’s always a woman to me.' He later said in an interview: 'To me, it’s a very simple understandable lyric. She may be that to you, but she’s this to me.'Nowadays, 'She’s Always a Woman' is often interpreted as an honest love song. As a song that declares love to a woman, despite her imperfections.Billy Joel By Rob Mieremet / Anefo – CC0,Billy Joel and Elizabeth WeberAs said earlier, the song was written for Joel’s first wife Elizabeth Weber. Weber was initially married to a band member of Billy Joel, drummer Jon Small. Captivated by her intelligence and straightforwardness, Billy Joel started an affair with her. When Small found out about their affair, he decided to end his partnership with Joel. Weber initially decided to leave Billy Joel too, which made him suicidal. She later returned to him.Read more: The 10 Best Billy Joel Songs of All Time Billy Joel and Elizabeth Weber married in September 1973. She was the inspiration behind Billy Joel’s 'Just The Way You Are' and 'She’s Always a Woman'. These love ballads couldn’t save Joel’s marriage and they eventually went through a rough divorce in 1982.At the end of the 70s, 'Just The Way You Are' and 'She’s Always a Woman' were staples in Billy Joel’s live shows. But after his divorce from Elizabeth Weber, he scrapped the songs from the setlist. Joel stated that he lost the passion to play the songs. In recent years he brought 'She’s Always a Woman' back on the setlist, often stating 'And then we got divorced' at the end of the song.The Song’s Legacy'She’s Always a Woman' appears on Billy Joel’s fifth studio album 'The Stranger' and was released as a single in 1978. The song peaked at number 17 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also reached the charts in Canada, Belgium, and The Netherlands. In 1986, 'She’s Always a Woman' entered the UK charts when the song was released as a double A-side with 'Just the Way You Are'. In 2010 the song reached the UK charts again due to a cover by Fyfe Dangerfield.

That's how I feel about too, my kids grew up seeing me happy when listening to or playing music, especially Billy Joel.  His music will always be something special that we share.

Difference between a Bill and an Act Legislative proposals are brought before either house of the Parliament of India in the form of a bill. A bill is the draft of a legislative proposal, which, when passed by both houses of Parliament and assented to by the President, becomes an act of Parliament. As soon as the bill has been framed, it has to be published in the newspapers and the general public is asked to comment in a democratic manner. The bill may then be amended to incorporate the public opinion in a constructive manner and then may be introduced in the Parliament by ministers or private members. The former are called government bills and the latter, private member's bill. Bills may also be classified as public bills and private bills. A public bill is one referring to a matter applying to the public in general, whereas a private bill relates to a particular person or corporation or institution. The Orphanages and Charitable Homes Bill or the Muslim Waqfs Bills are examples of private bills. A bill introduced in Lok Sabha pending for any reason lapses when the Lok Sabha is dissolved. However, bills in the Rajya Sabha never lapse, and can remain pending for decades. "", ""A bill is the draft of a legislative proposal. It has to pass through various stages before it becomes an act of Parliament. There are three stages through which a bill has to pass in one house of Parliament. The procedure is similar for the legislative assemblies of states. First reading The legislative process begins with the introduction of a bill in either house of Parliament, i.e. the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. A bill can be introduced either by a minister or by a private member. In the former case it is known as a government bill and in the latter case it is known as a private member's bill. It is necessary for a member-in-charge of the bill to ask for the leave of the house to introduce the bill. If leave is granted by the house, the bill is introduced. This stage is known as the first reading of the bill. If the motion for leave to introduce a bill is opposed, the speaker may, in his discretion, allow a brief explanatory statement to be made by the member who opposes the motion and the member-in-charge who moved the motion. Where a motion for leave to introduce a bill is opposed on the ground that the bill initiates legislation outside the legislative competence of the house, the speaker may permit a full discussion thereon. Thereafter, the question is put to the vote of the house. However, the motion for leave to introduce a finance bill or an appropriation bill is forthwith put to the vote of the house. Money/appropriation bills and financial bills can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha per Articles 109, 110 and 117. The Speaker of Lok Sabha decides whether a bill is a money bill or not. The vice-president of India, who is ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, decides whether a bill is a money bill or not when the bill is introduced in the Rajya Sabha. After a bill has been introduced, the presiding officer of the concerned house (speaker of the Lok Sabha or the chairman of the Rajya Sabha or anyone acting on their behalf) can refer the bill to the concerned standing committee for examination and to prepare a report thereon. If a bill is referred to a standing committee, the committee shall consider the general principles and clauses of the bill referred to them and make a report thereon. The committee can also seek expert opinion or the public opinion of those interested in the measure. After the bill has thus been considered, the committee submits its report to the house. The report of the committee, being of persuasive value, shall be treated as considered advice. Second reading The second reading consists of consideration of the bill which occurs in two stages. First stage "", 'When a bill has been passed by both houses following the described process, it is sent to the President for his approval per Article 111. The President can assent or withhold his assent to a bill or he can return a bill, other than a money bill which is recommended by the President himself to the houses. However Article 255 says that prior recommendation of the President or the Governor of a state wherever stipulated is not compulsory for an act of Parliament or of the legislature of a state but the final consent of the President or Governor is mandatory. If the President is of the view that a particular bill passed under the legislative powers of Parliament violates the Constitution, he can return the bill with his recommendations to pass the bill under the constituent powers of Parliament following the Article 368 procedure. The President shall not withhold constitutional amendment bill duly passed by Parliament per Article 368. If the President gives his assent, the bill is published in The Gazette of India and becomes an act from the date of his assent. If he withholds his assent, the bill is dropped, which is known as absolute veto. The President can exercise absolute veto on aid and advice of the Council of Ministers per Article 111 and Article 74. The President may also effectively withhold his assent as per his own discretion, which is known as pocket veto. The pocket veto has only been exercised once by President Zail Singh in 1986, over the Postal Act which allowed the government to open postal letters without warrant by amending the Indian Post Office Act, 1898. If the President returns it for reconsideration, the Parliament must discuss once again, but if it is passed again and returned to the President, he must give his assent to it. If Parliament is not happy with the President for not assenting a bill passed by it under its legislative powers, the bill can be modified as a constitutional amendment bill and passed under its constituent powers for compelling the president to give assent. In case a constitutional amendment act is violating the basic structure of the Constitution, the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court would quash the act. When Parliament is of the view that the actions of the President are violating the Constitution, impeachment proceedings against the president could be taken up to remove him under Article 61 where at least two-thirds of the total membership of each house of Parliament should vote in favour of the impeachment when charges against the president are found valid in an investigation. ', 'Bills which exclusively contain provisions for imposition and abolition of taxes, for appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund, etc., are certified as money bills by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Money bills can be introduced only in Lok Sabha on the recommendation of the President per Articles 109, 110 and 117. For every fiscal year, the annual budget or annual financial statement with demand for grants on the recommendation of the President per Articles 112 to 116 shall be passed by the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha cannot make amendments to a money bill passed by the Lok Sabha and sent to it. It can, however, recommend amendments in a money bill, but must return all money bills to Lok Sabha within fourteen days from the date of their receipt. The Lok Sabha can choose to accept or reject any or all of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha with regard to a money bill. If the Lok Sabha accepts any of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha, the money bill is deemed to have been passed by both houses with amendments recommended by Rajya Sabha and accepted by Lok Sabha. If the Lok Sabha does not accept any of the recommendations of Rajya Sabha, the money bill is deemed to have been passed by both houses in the form in which it was passed by Lok Sabha without any of the amendments recommended by Rajya Sabha. If a money bill passed by the Lok Sabha and transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for its recommendations is not returned to the Lok Sabha within fourteen days, it is deemed to have been passed by both houses at the expiration of the period in the form in which it was passed by the Lok Sabha. When a money bill introduced in the Lok Sabha by the government fails to get its approval, the ruling party is treated as not commanding the majority support in the Lok Sabha or shall be dismissed by the President to pave way for new government / fresh elections or opposition would move no confidence motion. ', ""At the time of the bill’s passage, about 14 per cent of Lok Sabha legislators were women. While that represents India’s highest proportion since its independence, it was far below the global average of 26.5 per cent, or the Central and Southern Asia average of 19 per cent. Among the state legislative assemblies, Chhattisgarh has the highest level of women legislators, at 18 per cent, while Himachal Pradesh has just one woman legislator and Mizoram has none. The new legislation requires that, in each election, 33 per cent of seats in the assemblies and the Lok Sabha be assigned for only female candidates.

Personal jurisdiction is the requirement that a given court have power over the defendant, based on minimum contacts with the forum. Subject-matter jurisdiction is the requirement that a given court have power to hear the specific kind of claim that is brought to that court. While litigating parties may waive personal jurisdiction, they cannot waive subject-matter jurisdiction.

In fact, the court may dismiss a case sua sponte (on its own) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1). General and Limited Jurisdiction ', ""The two primary sources of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts are diversity jurisdiction and federal question jurisdiction. Diversity jurisdiction generally permits individuals to bring claims in federal court where the claim exceeds $75,000 and the parties are citizens of different states. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. So, if a citizen of New York sues a citizen of California for more than $75,000, a federal court would have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear that claim. Under federal question jurisdiction, a litigant—regardless of the value of the claim—may bring a claim in federal court if it arises under federal law, including the U.S. Constitution. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Federal question jurisdiction requires that the federal element appears on the face of a well-plead complaint, is a substantial component of the complainant's claim, and is of significant federal interest. Federal question subject-matter jurisdiction is frequently derived from federal statutes granting a cause of action to parties who have suffered a particular injury. Furthermore, it is important to note that 28 U.S.C. § 1367 provides for supplemental jurisdiction in federal courts. Supplemental jurisdiction allows a federal court to adjudicate a claim over which it does not have independent subject-matter jurisdiction, on the basis that the claim is related to a claim over which the federal court does have independent jurisdiction.

Iovine sought the opinions of musicians with 'great taste', such as M.I.A., Pharrell Williams, will.i.am, and Gwen Stefani during the early developmental stage. Beats initially partnered with inventor Noel Lee and his company Monster Cable, an audio and video component manufacturer based in Brisbane, California, to manufacture and develop the first Beats-branded products, and debuted its first product, Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones, on July 25, 2008. Jimmy Iovine and David Guetta "", ""In October 2012, Beats unveiled its first two self-developed products, 'Beats Executive' headphones and 'Beats Pill' wireless speakers—Iovine believed that the company would now have to 'control [its] own destiny' in order to continue its growth. Iovine also commented on how other headphone makers had attempted to emulate Beats' celebrity endorsement business model (including Monster themselves, who unveiled Earth, Wind and Fire and Miles Davis-themed headphones at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show), stating that 'some of our competitors are cheap engineers who have never been to a recording studio. You can't just stick someone's name on a headphone that doesn't know anything about sound.'

Beats headphones: A sonic revolution In 2006, famed hip-hop producer Dr. Dre felt listening audiences all deserved the same high-quality sound that he experienced  in the studio. So he partnered with industry mogul Jimmy Iovine to create Beats by Dre. Their goal was simple: create headphones that help people hear all the music. Achieving their goal meant creating electronics that could bring the experience and emotion of hearing music in a professional recording studio to the headphones used by everyday music fans. And it worked. Just as Dre imagined,  Beats Electronics has become known for its unparalleled audio quality, as well as its supreme style. In 2014, Apple acquired the brand, elevating Beats’ tech capabilities even further.

Updated versions of these original Beats headphones are available through Verizon and include Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones and Beats Studio3 Wireless Over-Ear Headphones. Beats by Dr. Dre Executive: Elevated sophistication. October 2012—Building on the success of its inaugural line, Beats introduced the Executive headphones. These wireless Beats headphones catered more to music professionals and discerning audiophiles.

Beats Pill: A portable speaker in a capsule. October 2012—The Beats Pill was the brand’s first, non-headset-related product release. This sleek, easily transportable speaker had a capsule-based design with a curved appearance and used Bluetooth to connect to other devices.

Beats initially partnered with inventor Noel Lee and his company Monster Cable, an audio and video component manufacturer based in Brisbane, California, to manufacture and develop the first Beats-branded products, and debuted its first product, Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones, on July 25, 2008. Jimmy Iovine and David Guetta "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Electronics\nIn October 2012, Beats unveiled its first two self-developed products, 'Beats Executive' headphones and 'Beats Pill' wireless speakers—Iovine believed that the company would now have to 'control [its] own destiny' in order to continue its growth. Iovine also commented on how other headphone makers had attempted to emulate Beats' celebrity endorsement business model (including Monster themselves, who unveiled Earth, Wind and Fire and Miles Davis-themed headphones at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show), stating that 'some of our competitors are cheap engineers who have never been to a recording studio. You can't just stick someone's name on a headphone that doesn't know anything about sound.' Following the decision to transform Beats into an autonomous entity, the company's revenues reached the $1 billion mark, according to Iovine.

Beats headphones: A sonic revolution In 2006, famed hip-hop producer Dr. Dre felt listening audiences all deserved the same high-quality sound that he experienced  in the studio. So he partnered with industry mogul Jimmy Iovine to create Beats by Dre. Their goal was simple: create headphones that help people hear all the music. Achieving their goal meant creating electronics that could bring the experience and emotion of hearing music in a professional recording studio to the headphones used by everyday music fans. And it worked. Just as Dre imagined,  Beats Electronics has become known for its unparalleled audio quality, as well as its supreme style. In 2014, Apple acquired the brand, elevating Beats’ tech capabilities even further. Over the years Beats has evolved and expanded its product line to cater to the diverse needs of many listening audiences. Here’s a wrap-up of Beats’ sonic journey. Beats by Dr. Dre Studio: Redefining audio luxury. July 2008—Beats headphones took the world by storm with the release of Beats by Dr. Dre Studio, the company’s first product. These over-ear headphones offered a blend of bass and precision that set a benchmark for audio quality. The headphones quickly became known for their comfort and noise isolation. Updated versions of these original Beats headphones are available through Verizon and include Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones and Beats Studio3 Wireless Over-Ear Headphones. Beats by Dr. Dre Executive: Elevated sophistication. October 2012—Building on the success of its inaugural line, Beats introduced the Executive headphones. These wireless Beats headphones catered more to music professionals and discerning audiophiles. With their sleek aluminum design, noise-canceling technology and impressive battery life, they became the go-to choice for those who demanded both performance and style. Beats Pill: A portable speaker in a capsule. October 2012—The Beats Pill was the brand’s first, non-headset-related product release. This sleek, easily transportable speaker had a capsule-based design with a curved appearance and used Bluetooth to connect to other devices. In 2013, the Beats Pill 2.0 was released, which featured longer battery life and a port for charging other USB devices. Other features included the ability to pair Pills together with near-field communication (NFC) to play the same audio either individually on other devices or to be able to play left and right stereo channels simultaneously. Beats Solo2: The beat goes on. ', ""https://www.verizon.com/articles/Accessories/history-of-beats-headphones/\n\x1b[102m[1] September 2016—The Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones brought a game-changing feature: the Apple W1 chip\x1b[0m. This technology made pairing the headphones with Apple devices seamless. The battery life also soared to an impressive 40 hours, allowing people to listen for way longer without having to worry about charging. Beats noise-canceling headphones were now firmly established as one of the strongest brands on the market for maximizing the potential of music. urBeats 3: Lightweight and elevated. September 2017—This affordable pair of wired audio headphones were meant to maximize the listening experience with a choice between 4 ear-tip sizes for an individualized, secure fit. Lightweight and ergonomic, urBeats3 Earphones made it easy and comfortable to listen to music for hours on end. The discontinuation of this model signaled a broader shift toward Bluetooth-based wireless audio. Beats X: Immersive and fit for life. February 2017—The Beats X neckband-style earphones were designed for clear sound throughout the day with a long battery life. Their unique flex-form cable provided all-day comfort. BeatsX also featured an incredibly sleek design and the secure-fit wingtips offer added stability. The headphones have a flat, no-tangle cable and Apple’s W1 wireless chip for stellar compatibility with iOS devices. They also featured Quick Charge, allowing for new buds to last up to two hours from a single five-minute charge. Beats Studio3 Wireless: Sound for any surrounding. June 2017—Beats Studio3 Wireless raised the bar yet again by introducing Pure Adaptive Noise Canceling (Pure ANC). This innovation ensured that the headphones adjusted their noise cancellation in real-time to match the listener's surroundings. This was a major benefit for travelers and commuters who wanted to truly immerse themselves in their music while moving through a variety of different locations and situations. Beats Powerbeats Pro: Unleash your workout. May 2019—Diving into the wireless earbud market, Beats introduced the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2019. These wireless earbuds became a favorite among athletes and fitness enthusiasts. They had adjustable secure-fit ear hooks for added comfort, exceptional sound quality and stability, and sweat and water resistance—all designed to stay keep up with athletes during their workouts.

How are Episcopal and Catholic views on social issues different? "", ""The chair (cathedra) of the Bishop of Rome (Pope) of the Catholic Church in the Archbasilica of St. John in Lateran in Rome, Italy, represents his episcopal authority. An episcopal polity is a hierarchical form of church governance ('ecclesiastical polity') in which the chief local authorities are called bishops. The word 'bishop' here is derived via the British Latin and Vulgar Latin term *ebiscopus/*biscopus, from the Ancient Greek ἐπίσκοπος epískopos meaning 'overseer'. It is the structure used by many of the major Christian Churches and denominations, such as the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Anabaptist, Lutheran, and Anglican churches or denominations, and other churches founded independently from these lineages.[citation needed] Many Methodist denominations have a form of episcopal polity known as connexionalism. History Bishops are considered to derive their authority from an unbroken, personal apostolic succession from the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Bishops with such authority are said to represent the historical episcopate or historic episcopate. Churches with this type of government usually believe that the Church requires episcopal government as described in the New Testament (see 1 Timothy 3 and 2 Timothy 1). In some systems, bishops may be subject in limited ways to bishops holding a higher office (variously called archbishops, metropolitans, or patriarchs, depending upon the tradition). They also meet in councils or synods. These gatherings, subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops, usually make important decisions, though the synod or council may also be purely advisory. For much of the written history of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the Reformation. Many Protestant churches are now organized by either congregational or presbyterian church polities, both descended from the writings of John Calvin, a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the Catholic Church precipitated by The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther. However, some people have disputed the episcopal polity before the reformation, such as Aerius of Sebaste in the 4th century. Overview of episcopal churches The government of a bishop is typically symbolized by a cathedral church, such as the bishops's see at Chartres Cathedral. The definition of the word episcopal has variation among Christian traditions. There are subtle differences in governmental principles among episcopal churches at the present time. To some extent the separation of episcopal churches can be traced to these differences in ecclesiology, that is, their theological understanding of church and church governance. For some, 'episcopal churches' are churches that use a hierarchy of bishops who identify as being in an unbroken, personal apostolic succession. 'Episcopal' is also commonly used to distinguish between the various organizational structures of denominations. For instance, 'Presbyterian' (Greek: πρεσβύτερος, presbýteros) is used to describe a church governed by a hierarchy of assemblies of elected elders, referred to as presbyterian polity. Similarly, 'episcopal' is used to describe a church governed by bishops. Self-governed local congregations, governed neither by elders nor bishops, are usually described as 'congregational'. "", ""The conciliar idea of episcopal government continues in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In Eastern Orthodoxy, all autocephalous primates are seen as collectively gathering around Christ, with other archbishops and bishops gathering around them, and so forth. There is no single primate with exclusive authority comparable to the Pope in Rome. However, the Patriarch of Constantinople (now Istanbul) is seen as the primus inter pares, the 'first among equals' of the autocephalous churches of Eastern Orthodoxy. Oriental Orthodox churches "", ""Functionally, Anglican episcopal authority is expressed synodically, although individual provinces may accord their primate with more or less authority to act independently. Called variously 'synods', 'councils', or 'conventions', they meet under episcopal chairmanship. In many jurisdictions, conciliar resolutions that have been passed require episcopal assent or consent to take force. Seen in this way, Anglicans often speak of 'the bishop-in-synod' as the force and authority of episcopal governance. Such conciliar authority extends to the standard areas of doctrine, discipline, and worship, but in these regards is limited by Anglicanism's tradition of the limits of authority. Those limits are expressed in Article XXI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, ratified in 1571 (significantly, just as the Council of Trent was drawing to a close), which held that 'General Councils ... may err, and sometimes have erred ... wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture.' Hence, Anglican jurisdictions have traditionally been conservative in their approach to either innovative doctrinal development or in encompassing actions of the church as doctrinal (see lex orandi, lex credendi). Anglican synodical government, though varied in expression, is characteristically representative. Provinces of the Anglican Communion, their ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses are governed by councils consisting not only of bishops, but also representatives of the presbyterate and laity. There is no international juridical authority in Anglicanism, although the tradition's common experience of episcopacy, symbolised by the historical link with the See of Canterbury, along with a common and complex liturgical tradition, has provided a measure of unity. This has been reinforced by the Lambeth Conferences of Anglican Communion bishops, which first met in 1867.

Extracellular fluid has two primary constituents: the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and the interstitial fluid (IF) that surrounds all cells not in the blood. Intracellular Fluid ', ""In cell biology, extracellular fluid (ECF) denotes all body fluid outside the cells of any multicellular organism. Total body water in healthy adults is about 50–60% (range 45 to 75%) of total body weight; women and the obese typically have a lower percentage than lean men. Extracellular fluid makes up about one-third of body fluid, the remaining two-thirds is intracellular fluid within cells. The main component of the extracellular fluid is the interstitial fluid that surrounds cells. Extracellular fluid is the internal environment of all multicellular animals, and in those animals with a blood circulatory system, a proportion of this fluid is blood plasma. Plasma and interstitial fluid are the two components that make up at least 97% of the ECF. Lymph makes up a small percentage of the interstitial fluid. The remaining small portion of the ECF includes the transcellular fluid (about 2.5%). The ECF can also be seen as having two components – plasma and lymph as a delivery system, and interstitial fluid for water and solute exchange with the cells. The extracellular fluid, in particular the interstitial fluid, constitutes the body's internal environment that bathes all of the cells in the body. The ECF composition is therefore crucial for their normal functions, and is maintained by a number of homeostatic mechanisms involving negative feedback. Homeostasis regulates, among others, the pH, sodium, potassium, and calcium concentrations in the ECF. The volume of body fluid, blood glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels are also tightly homeostatically maintained. The volume of extracellular fluid in a young adult male of 70 kg (154 lbs) is 20% of body weight – about fourteen liters. Eleven liters are interstitial fluid and the remaining three liters are plasma. Components The main component of the extracellular fluid (ECF) is the interstitial fluid, or tissue fluid, which surrounds the cells in the body. The other major component of the ECF is the intravascular fluid of the circulatory system called blood plasma. "", 'Intracellular compartment The intracellular fluid (ICF) is all fluids contained inside the cells, which consists of cytosol and fluid in the cell nucleus. The cytosol is the matrix in which cellular organelles are suspended. The cytosol and organelles together compose the cytoplasm. The cell membranes are the outer barrier. In humans, the intracellular compartment contains on average about 28 liters (6.2 imp gal; 7.4 U.S. gal) of fluid, and under ordinary circumstances remains in osmotic equilibrium. It contains moderate quantities of magnesium and sulfate ions. In the cell nucleus, the fluid component of the nucleoplasm is called the nucleosol. Extracellular compartment The interstitial, intravascular and transcellular compartments comprise the extracellular compartment. Its extracellular fluid (ECF) contains about one-third of total body water. Intravascular compartment ', ""The interstitial compartment (also called 'tissue space') surrounds tissue cells. It is filled with interstitial fluid, including lymph. Interstitial fluid provides the immediate microenvironment that allows for movement of ions, proteins and nutrients across the cell barrier. This fluid is not static, but is continually being refreshed by the blood capillaries and recollected by lymphatic capillaries. In the average male (70-kilogram or 150-pound) human body, the interstitial space has approximately 10.5 liters (2.3 imp gal; 2.8 U.S. gal) of fluid. Transcellular compartment "", 'While fluid compartments may share some characteristics with the divisions defined by the anatomical compartments of the body, these terms are not one in the same. Fluid compartments are defined by their position relative to the cellular membrane of the cells that make up the body’s tissues. Intracellular Fluid The intracellular fluid of the cytosol or intracellular fluid (or cytoplasm ) is the fluid found inside cells. It is separated into compartments by membranes that encircle the various organelles of the cell. For example, the mitochondrial matrix separates the mitochondrion into compartments. The contents of a eukaryotic cell within the cell membrane, excluding the cell nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles (e.g., mitochondria, plastides, lumen of endoplasmic reticulum, etc.), is referred to as the cytoplasm. The cytosol: The cytosol (11) is the fluid within the plasma membrane of a cell and contains the organelles. The cytosol includes dissolved molecules and water. ', 'Body fluids can be discussed in terms of their specific fluid compartment, a location that is largely separate from another compartment by some form of a physical barrier. The intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment is the system that includes all fluid enclosed in cells by their plasma membranes. Extracellular fluid (ECF) surrounds all cells in the body. Extracellular fluid has two primary constituents: the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and the interstitial fluid (IF) that surrounds all cells not in the blood (Figure 26.1.2).

Intracellular Fluid ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_fluid\nIn cell biology, extracellular fluid (ECF) denotes all body fluid outside the cells of any multicellular organism. Total body water in healthy adults is about 50–60% (range 45 to 75%) of total body weight; women and the obese typically have a lower percentage than lean men. Extracellular fluid makes up about one-third of body fluid, the remaining two-thirds is intracellular fluid within cells. The main component of the extracellular fluid is the interstitial fluid that surrounds cells. Extracellular fluid is the internal environment of all multicellular animals, and in those animals with a blood circulatory system, a proportion of this fluid is blood plasma. Plasma and interstitial fluid are the two components that make up at least 97% of the ECF. Lymph makes up a small percentage of the interstitial fluid. The remaining small portion of the ECF includes the transcellular fluid (about 2.5%). The ECF can also be seen as having two components – plasma and lymph as a delivery system, and interstitial fluid for water and solute exchange with the cells. The extracellular fluid, in particular the interstitial fluid, constitutes the body's internal environment that bathes all of the cells in the body. The ECF composition is therefore crucial for their normal functions, and is maintained by a number of homeostatic mechanisms involving negative feedback. Homeostasis regulates, among others, the pH, sodium, potassium, and calcium concentrations in the ECF. The volume of body fluid, blood glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels are also tightly homeostatically maintained. The volume of extracellular fluid in a young adult male of 70 kg (154 lbs) is 20% of body weight – about fourteen liters. Eleven liters are interstitial fluid and the remaining three liters are plasma. Components The main component of the extracellular fluid (ECF) is the interstitial fluid, or tissue fluid, which surrounds the cells in the body. The other major component of the ECF is the intravascular fluid of the circulatory system called blood plasma. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_compartments\nIntracellular compartment The intracellular fluid (ICF) is all fluids contained inside the cells, which consists of cytosol and fluid in the cell nucleus. The cytosol is the matrix in which cellular organelles are suspended. The cytosol and organelles together compose the cytoplasm. The cell membranes are the outer barrier. In humans, the intracellular compartment contains on average about 28 liters (6.2 imp gal; 7.4 U.S. gal) of fluid, and under ordinary circumstances remains in osmotic equilibrium. It contains moderate quantities of magnesium and sulfate ions. In the cell nucleus, the fluid component of the nucleoplasm is called the nucleosol. Extracellular compartment The interstitial, intravascular and transcellular compartments comprise the extracellular compartment. Its extracellular fluid (ECF) contains about one-third of total body water. Intravascular compartment ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_compartments\nThe interstitial compartment (also called 'tissue space') surrounds tissue cells. It is filled with interstitial fluid, including lymph. Interstitial fluid provides the immediate microenvironment that allows for movement of ions, proteins and nutrients across the cell barrier. This fluid is not static, but is continually being refreshed by the blood capillaries and recollected by lymphatic capillaries. In the average male (70-kilogram or 150-pound) human body, the interstitial space has approximately 10.5 liters (2.3 imp gal; 2.8 U.S. gal) of fluid.

Among South American rivers, it is second in length only to the Amazon River. It merges with the Paraguay River and then farther downstream with the Uruguay River to form the Río de la Plata and empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The first European to go up the Paraná River was the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot, in 1526, while working for Spain. A drought hit the river in 2021, causing a 77-year low. Etymology In eastern South America there is 'an immense number of river names containing the element para- or parana-', from Guarani language words meaning 'river' or 'sea'; attempts to derive a more precise meaning for the name of this, the largest of them, e.g. 'kin of the sea', have been discounted. Course The course is formed at the confluence of the Paranaiba and Rio Grande rivers in southern Brazil. From the confluence the river flows in a generally southwestern direction for about 619 km (385 mi) before encountering the city of Saltos del Guaira, Paraguay. This was once the location of the Guaíra Falls (Sete Quedas waterfalls, where the Paraná fell over a series of seven cascades. This natural feature was said to rival the world-famous Iguazu Falls to the south. The falls were flooded, however, by the construction of the Itaipu Dam, which began operating in 1984. After merging with the Iguazu, the Paraná becomes the natural border between Paraguay and Argentina. Overlooking the Paraná River from Encarnación, Paraguay, across the river, is downtown Posadas, Argentina. The river continues its general southward course for about 468 km (291 mi) before making a gradual turn to the west for another 820 km (510 mi), and then encounters the Paraguay River, the largest tributary along the course of the river. Before this confluence, the river passes through a second major hydroelectric project, the Yacyretá Dam, a joint project between Paraguay and Argentina. The massive reservoir formed by the project has been the source of a number of problems for people living along the river, most notably the poorer merchants and residents in the low-lying areas of Encarnación, a major city on the southern border of Paraguay. River levels rose dramatically upon completion of the dam, flooding out large sections of the city's lower areas. Together with its tributaries, the Rio Paraná forms a massive drainage basin that encompasses much of the southcentral part of South America, essentially including all of Paraguay, much of southern Brazil, northern Argentina, and the southeastern part of Bolivia. If the Uruguay River is counted as a tributary to the Paraná, this watershed extends to cover most of Uruguay as well. The volume of water flowing into the Atlantic Ocean through the Río de la Plata roughly equals the volume at the Mississippi River delta.

River levels rose dramatically upon completion of the dam, flooding out large sections of the city's lower areas. Together with its tributaries, the Rio Paraná forms a massive drainage basin that encompasses much of the southcentral part of South America, essentially including all of Paraguay, much of southern Brazil, northern Argentina, and the southeastern part of Bolivia. If the Uruguay River is counted as a tributary to the Paraná, this watershed extends to cover most of Uruguay as well. The volume of water flowing into the Atlantic Ocean through the Río de la Plata roughly equals the volume at the Mississippi River delta. This watershed contains a number of large cities, including São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Rosario, Asunción, Brasília, and La Plata.

Thakur’s remarks about the ‘burden’ being placed on the judiciary firmly brought the spotlight back on to the issue of judicial delays and backlogs in India. Photo: Hindustan Times Read Full Story In most years, the annual Joint Conference of Chief Ministers of the States and Chief Justices of the High Courts gets barely a passing mention in media outlets and is forgotten soon after. This year it was different. ', ""With India’s population being pegged at 1.2 billion as of May 2016, applying this benchmark, India should have approximately 60,000 judges. As on 1 January 2016, according to Court News, a publication of the Supreme Court of India, there were 16,119 judges in the subordinate judiciary, 598 in high courts and 26 in the Supreme Court. The latest figures (as on 11 July 2016), as seen from the National Judicial Data Grid and Department of Justice data, tell us that there are 16,438 judges at the subordinate judiciary level, 621 in high courts and 29 in the Supreme Court. All of this suggests that getting anywhere close to CJI’s benchmark of 70,000 or even 65,000 is going to be a herculean, if not impossible, task in the next few decades. However, a fundamental question needs to be answered: Do we actually need 70,000 judges to dispose of the pending 32 million cases in the Indian judicial system? The numbers suggest otherwise. For a start, even with the present strength, courts dispose of almost as many cases as are filed in a given year. For instance, between July 2014 and July 2015, with a working strength of between 15,500 and 15,600 judges, the subordinate courts in India disposed of about 18,730,046 cases as against 18,625,038 cases which were filed in the same period—just a little more than the number of cases filed. This must give us pause to question once again the basis for the figure of 70,000 judges. The Law Commission’s methodology The origin of the benchmark of '50 judges per million' lies in the 120th report of the Law Commission of India. That report itself is very laconic. It is all of five pages long. While it suggests rate of pendency or rate of litigation as a basis to fix judges’ strength, it doesn’t actually carry out the mathematical exercise of arriving at a number on the basis of available data. "", ""The Supreme Court of India is the apex judicial body under the Constitution of India. Article 124 of the Constitution states that 'There shall be a Supreme Court of India.' The Supreme Court came into existence on 26 January 1950 with the coming into force of the Constitution. The Supreme Court initially functioned from the old Parliament House till it moved to the present building located on Tilak Marg, New Delhi in 1958. On 28 January 1950, two days after India became a Sovereign Democratic Republic, the Supreme Court was inaugurated. The inauguration took place in the Chamber of Princes in the old Parliament building where the Federal Court of India sat for 12 years from 1937 to 1950. "", 'After its inauguration on 28 January 1950, the Supreme Court commenced its sittings in a part of the old Parliament House. The Court moved into a new building in 1958. The first President of India Dr. Rajendra Prasad inaugurated the present building of the Supreme Court of India on 4 August 1958. The building is shaped to project the image of scales of justice. It has a 27.6 metre high dome and a spacious colonnaded verandah. The Central Wing of the building is the centre beam of the scales. The Chief Justice’s Court is the largest of the courts located in the centre of the Central Wing. There is a life size figure of Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of truth and non-violence in the courtyard opposite the Chief Justice’s Court. The statue was unveiled by the 26th Chief Justice of India, Justice A.M. Ahmadi on 1 August 1996. There is also a 7-foot tall statue of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar which was unveiled by Hon’ble President of India, Smt. Droupadi Murmu in the presence of the 50th Chief Justice of India, Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud on 26 November 2023. The statue honours the architect of the Constitution and captures him in a lawyer’s gown, holding a copy of the Constitution in his hand. To visit the building, one may book a guided tour from the Supreme Court website or obtain the visitor’s pass from the SuSwagatam portal or the front desk of the Supreme Court. Three extensions were made to the original building- for the first time in 1979, then in 1994, and again in 2015. In 1979, two New Wings – the East Wing and the West Wing were added to the complex.

In 1994, the second extension of the building was made which connected the East and the West Wings.The third extension – the New Extension Block near the Supreme Court Museum was inaugurated by the then Chief Justice of India, Justice H.L. Dattu on 4 November 2015 and some of the Sections from the existing building were shifted to the new building. On 17 July 2019, Hon’ble President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the Additional Building Complex of the Supreme Court of India. The additional complex, with a total built up area of 1,80,700 sq. mts. has five functional blocks and one service block. The curvature of the building rises from the ground level in the colour scheme and sandstone external cladding, drawing inspiration from the original architecture of the Supreme Court. The Additional Building Complex also houses the New Judges’ Library. The original Constitution of 1950 envisaged a Supreme Court with a Chief Justice and 7 puisne Judges – leaving it to Parliament to increase this number. In the early years, all the Judges of the Supreme Court sat together (en banc) to hear the cases presented before them. Considering the increase in workload, Parliament increased the number of Judges from 8 in 1950 to 11 in 1956, 14 in 1960, 18 in 1978, 26 in 1986, 31 in 2009 and 34 in 2019 (current strength). Today, the Judges sit in Benches of two and three and come together in larger Benches of 5 and more (Constitution Bench) to decide any conflicting decisions between benches of the Supreme Court or any substantial questions concerning the interpretation of the Constitution. The proceedings of the Supreme Court are conducted in English. The practice and procedure of working of the Registry on the judicial side is regulated by the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 and Handbook on Practice and Procedure and Office Procedure.

Thakur’s remarks about the ‘burden’ being placed on the judiciary firmly brought the spotlight back on to the issue of judicial delays and backlogs in India. Photo: Hindustan Times Read Full Story In most years, the annual Joint Conference of Chief Ministers of the States and Chief Justices of the High Courts gets barely a passing mention in media outlets and is forgotten soon after. This year it was different. ', ""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/3B97SMGhseobYhZ6qpAYoN/How-many-judges-does-India-really-need.html\nWith India’s population being pegged at 1.2 billion as of May 2016, applying this benchmark, India should have approximately 60,000 judges. As on 1 January 2016, according to Court News, a publication of the Supreme Court of India, there were 16,119 judges in the subordinate judiciary, 598 in high courts and 26 in the Supreme Court. The latest figures (as on 11 July 2016), as seen from the National Judicial Data Grid and Department of Justice data, tell us that there are 16,438 judges at the subordinate judiciary level, 621 in high courts and 29 in the Supreme Court. All of this suggests that getting anywhere close to CJI’s benchmark of 70,000 or even 65,000 is going to be a herculean, if not impossible, task in the next few decades. However, a fundamental question needs to be answered: Do we actually need 70,000 judges to dispose of the pending 32 million cases in the Indian judicial system? The numbers suggest otherwise. For a start, even with the present strength, courts dispose of almost as many cases as are filed in a given year. For instance, between July 2014 and July 2015, with a working strength of between 15,500 and 15,600 judges, the subordinate courts in India disposed of about 18,730,046 cases as against 18,625,038 cases which were filed in the same period—just a little more than the number of cases filed. This must give us pause to question once again the basis for the figure of 70,000 judges. The Law Commission’s methodology The origin of the benchmark of '50 judges per million' lies in the 120th report of the Law Commission of India. That report itself is very laconic. It is all of five pages long. While it suggests rate of pendency or rate of litigation as a basis to fix judges’ strength, it doesn’t actually carry out the mathematical exercise of arriving at a number on the basis of available data. "", ""https://www.sci.gov.in/about-department/history/\nThe Supreme Court of India is the apex judicial body under the Constitution of India. Article 124 of the Constitution states that 'There shall be a Supreme Court of India.' The Supreme Court came into existence on 26 January 1950 with the coming into force of the Constitution. The Supreme Court initially functioned from the old Parliament House till it moved to the present building located on Tilak Marg, New Delhi in 1958. On 28 January 1950, two days after India became a Sovereign Democratic Republic, the Supreme Court was inaugurated. The inauguration took place in the Chamber of Princes in the old Parliament building where the Federal Court of India sat for 12 years from 1937 to 1950. "", 'https://www.sci.gov.in/about-department/history/\nAfter its inauguration on 28 January 1950, the Supreme Court commenced its sittings in a part of the old Parliament House. The Court moved into a new building in 1958. The first President of India Dr. Rajendra Prasad inaugurated the present building of the Supreme Court of India on 4 August 1958. The building is shaped to project the image of scales of justice. It has a 27.6 metre high dome and a spacious colonnaded verandah. The Central Wing of the building is the centre beam of the scales. The Chief Justice’s Court is the largest of the courts located in the centre of the Central Wing. There is a life size figure of Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of truth and non-violence in the courtyard opposite the Chief Justice’s Court. The statue was unveiled by the 26th Chief Justice of India, Justice A.M. Ahmadi on 1 August 1996. There is also a 7-foot tall statue of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar which was unveiled by Hon’ble President of India, Smt. Droupadi Murmu in the presence of the 50th Chief Justice of India, Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud on 26 November 2023. The statue honours the architect of the Constitution and captures him in a lawyer’s gown, holding a copy of the Constitution in his hand. To visit the building, one may book a guided tour from the Supreme Court website or obtain the visitor’s pass from the SuSwagatam portal or the front desk of the Supreme Court. Three extensions were made to the original building- for the first time in 1979, then in 1994, and again in 2015. In 1979, two New Wings – the East Wing and the West Wing were added to the complex. There are 19 courtrooms in the various wings of the building. In 1994, the second extension of the building was made which connected the East and the West Wings.The third extension – the New Extension Block near the Supreme Court Museum was inaugurated by the then Chief Justice of India, Justice H.L.

After this revelation, Luke connects the dots to realize that Leia is his sister, finally telling her in Return of the Jedi before leaving to face Vader one last time. From this point, Luke and Leia's connection becomes stronger, as does their oneness with the Force, as demonstrated in The Last Jedi through Leia's space travel and Luke's projection trick against Kylo Ren.

The characters' relationship may be a Star Wars staple, but their connection wasn't always planned. A New Hope set up the idea of them being attracted to each other before The Empire Strikes Back planted the seeds for their familial connection, which Episode VI ultimately confirmed. The fact that making Leia and Luke related wasn't originally planned is well-known, but the retcon's background is more obscure. However, 1997's Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays offered insight into how the twist influenced Episode VI.

The estranged siblings didn't know about their familial relationship until 'Return of the Jedi.' They even shared a passionate kiss in the previous movie, 'The Empire Strikes Back.' That kiss has been the subject of much discussion and has elicited more than a few 'Ick! You kissed your sister!' responses.

On December 23, 1942, the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played. That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed. Those in uniform were required to salute. On July 7, 1976, the law was simplified. Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts, men removing their hats, irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting. On August 12, 1998, the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions, but differentiating between 'those in uniform' and 'members of the Armed Forces and veterans' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed. Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegiance versus the National Anthem, throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem, and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand (or hat) over their heart. After 9/11, the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the national anthem became nearly universal. Since 1998, federal law (viz., the United States Code 36 U.S.C. § 301) states that during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present including those in uniform should stand at attention; non-military service individuals should face the flag with the right hand over the heart; members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present and not in uniform may render the military salute; military service persons not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart; and members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. The law further provides that when the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. Military law requires all vehicles on the installation to stop when the song is played and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face the direction of the music and either salute, in uniform, or place the right hand over the heart, if out of uniform. The law was amended in 2008, and since allows military veterans to salute out of uniform, as well.

In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that 'The Star-Spangled Banner' be played at military and other appropriate occasions. The playing of the song two years later during the seventh-inning stretch of Game One of the 1918 World Series, and thereafter during each game of the series is often cited as the first instance that the anthem was played at a baseball game, though evidence shows that the 'Star-Spangled Banner' was performed as early as 1897 at Opening Day ceremonies in Philadelphia and then more regularly at the Polo Grounds in New York City beginning in 1898. The tradition of performing the national anthem before every baseball game began in World War II. Between 1918 and 1929, John Charles Linthicum, the U.S. congressman from Maryland at the time, introduced a series of six unsuccessful bills to officially recognize 'The Star-Spangled Banner' as the national anthem. "", ""In 1930, Veterans of Foreign Wars started a petition for the United States to officially recognize 'The Star-Spangled Banner' as the national anthem. Five million people signed the petition. The petition was presented to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on January 31, 1930. On the same day, Elsie Jorss-Reilley and Grace Evelyn Boudlin sang the song to the committee to refute the perception that it was too high pitched for a typical person to sing. The committee voted in favor of sending the bill to the House floor for a vote. The House of Representatives passed the bill later that year. The Senate passed the bill on March 3, 1931. President Herbert Hoover signed the bill on March 4, 1931, officially adopting 'The Star-Spangled Banner' as the national anthem of the United States of America. As currently codified, the United States Code states that '[t]he composition consisting of the words and music known as the Star-Spangled Banner is the national anthem.' Although all four stanzas of the poem officially compose the National Anthem, only the first stanza is generally sung, the other three being much lesser known. Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of U.S. officialdom. 'Hail, Columbia' served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee', whose melody is identical to 'God Save the King', the United Kingdom's national anthem, also served as a de facto national anthem. Following the War of 1812 and subsequent U.S. wars, other songs emerged to compete for popularity at public events, among them 'America the Beautiful', which itself was being considered before 1931 as a candidate to become the national anthem of the United States. In the fourth verse, Key's 1814 published version of the poem is written as, 'And this be our motto-'In God is our trust!'' In 1956 when 'In God We Trust' was under consideration to be adopted as the national motto of the United States by the US Congress, the words of the fourth verse of The Star Spangled Banner were brought up in arguments supporting adoption of the motto.

"", ""The word robot was introduced to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people called robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans). "", ""The word robotics, used to describe this field of study, was coined by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Asimov created the Three Laws of Robotics which are a recurring theme in his books. These have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction. (The three laws are pure fiction, and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them, and in fact most robots serve military purposes, which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law. 'People think about Asimov's laws, but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn't work. If you read the short stories, every single one is about a failure, and they are totally impractical,' said Dr. Joanna Bryson of the University of Bath.) Modern robots A laparoscopic robotic surgery machine Mobile robot Main articles: Mobile robot and Automated guided vehicle "", ""The first reference in Western literature to mechanical servants appears in Homer's Iliad. In Book XVIII, Hephaestus, god of fire, creates new armor for the hero Achilles, assisted by robots. According to the Rieu translation, 'Golden maidservants hastened to help their master. They looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods.' The words 'robot' or 'android' are not used to describe them, but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance. 'The first use of the word Robot was in Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (written in 1920)'. Writer Karel Čapek was born in Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic). "", '‘Robot’ makes its debut in the English language, perhaps surprisingly, during the Victorian age: the first citation is from 1839. But it doesn’t refer to the humanoid machines of a million science-fiction novels and films made since, but rather to a ‘central European system of serfdom, by which a tenant’s rent was paid in forced labour or service’ (OED). This word came to English via the German, though the word ultimately derives from the Czech robota meaning ‘forced labour’ or ‘slavery’. Not a very pleasant etymology; though the Austrian Empire banned slavery in 1848, which is something. The modern meaning of the word ‘robot’ has its origins in a 1920 play by the remarkable and fascinating Czech writer Karel Čapek. The play, titled R. U. R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), begins in a factory which manufactures artificial people, the ‘universal robots’ of the play’s title. The robots are designed to serve humans and work for them, but the robots eventually turn on their masters, wiping out the human race (shades, or rather foreshadowings, of The Terminator here). This sense of ‘robot’ is taken from the earlier one defined above – namely, the Czech for ‘slave worker’ or ‘drudge’. But Karel Čapek himself didn’t coin the word. As we’ve already seen, the word was in existence before he wrote his play. But nor did Čapek come up with the idea of taking the word ‘robot’ and using it to describe the man-made beings that feature in R. U. R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots). He originally called them labori, from the Latin for ‘work’, but it was his brother, Josef Čapek, who suggested roboti. ', ""The term 'robot' was ushered into existence by Karel Capek in his play Rossum's Universal Robots. Capek was a Czech science fiction w riter in the early 19th century. Contrary to popular belief, Capek did not invent the word 'robot'. His elder brother Josef Capek derived the word from the Czech noun 'robota' meaning 'labour', and 'robotnik' meaning 'workman' (Dudek & Jenkin 2010).Robots have come a long way from being just machines capable of performing predefined tasks. Today's robots are more intelligent, versatile, and better equipped than they have ever been. But what is a robot? The definition that best fits the work presented in this thesis is from Ronald Arkin's Behaviour Based Robotics: 'An intelligent Robot is a machine able to extract information from its environment and use knowledge about its world to move safely in a meaningful and purposive manner.' A robot's ability to perceive its environment depends on the sensors with which it is outfitted. Modern robots are equipped with a variety of sensors such as sonar, radar, contact sensors, laser range finders, cameras, etc. Robots that are developed following the same general structure as humans are known as humanoid robots.

But where did the idea for robotics come from? More importantly, where is it headed? Let’s take a look at the history of robotics, and what their future looks like. History of Robotics \x1b[92m[1] The word 'robot' comes from the Czech word 'robota', meaning forced labor\x1b[0m. That word is itself derived from the Proto-Slavic word 'orbota', meaning hard work. \x1b[92m[2] The term robot was originally introduced by Karel Capek in his 1920 play Rossumovi Univerzáln Roboti, which can be translated to 'Rossum’s Universal Robots.'\x1b[0m The play talked about a time when artificial organic humanoid robots were built, but they quickly grew dissatisfied, leading to a robot revolution and a new robot society. In 1942, American writer Isaac Asimov used the term 'robotics' for the first time in a short story titled 'Runabout.' He suggested the 'Three Laws of Robotics' as a guideline for all sci-fi robot characters in his stories. Law One "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot\nThe term comes from a Slavic root, robot-, with meanings associated with labor. \x1b[96m[3] The word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R\x1b[0m. \x1b[96m[4] (Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti – Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek, though it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor\x1b[0m. Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen. The first commercial, digital and programmable robot was built by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate. It was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot\nThe word robot was introduced to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people called robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans). "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot\nThe word robotics, used to describe this field of study, was coined by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Asimov created the Three Laws of Robotics which are a recurring theme in his books. These have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction. (The three laws are pure fiction, and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them, and in fact most robots serve military purposes, which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law. 'People think about Asimov's laws, but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn't work. If you read the short stories, every single one is about a failure, and they are totally impractical,' said Dr. Joanna Bryson of the University of Bath.) Modern robots A laparoscopic robotic surgery machine Mobile robot Main articles: Mobile robot and Automated guided vehicle "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot\nThe first reference in Western literature to mechanical servants appears in Homer's Iliad. In Book XVIII, Hephaestus, god of fire, creates new armor for the hero Achilles, assisted by robots. According to the Rieu translation, 'Golden maidservants hastened to help their master. They looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods.' The words 'robot' or 'android' are not used to describe them, but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance. 'The first use of the word Robot was in Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (written in 1920)'. Writer Karel Čapek was born in Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic). "", 'https://interestingliterature.com/2016/03/the-curious-origin-of-the-word-robot/\n‘Robot’ makes its debut in the English language, perhaps surprisingly, during the Victorian age: the first citation is from 1839. But it doesn’t refer to the humanoid machines of a million science-fiction novels and films made since, but rather to a ‘central European system of serfdom, by which a tenant’s rent was paid in forced labour or service’ (OED). This word came to English via the German, though the word ultimately derives from the Czech robota meaning ‘forced labour’ or ‘slavery’. Not a very pleasant etymology; though the Austrian Empire banned slavery in 1848, which is something. The modern meaning of the word ‘robot’ has its origins in a 1920 play by the remarkable and fascinating Czech writer Karel Čapek. The play, titled R. U. R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), begins in a factory which manufactures artificial people, the ‘universal robots’ of the play’s title. The robots are designed to serve humans and work for them, but the robots eventually turn on their masters, wiping out the human race (shades, or rather foreshadowings, of The Terminator here). This sense of ‘robot’ is taken from the earlier one defined above – namely, the Czech for ‘slave worker’ or ‘drudge’. But Karel Čapek himself didn’t coin the word. As we’ve already seen, the word was in existence before he wrote his play. But nor did Čapek come up with the idea of taking the word ‘robot’ and using it to describe the man-made beings that feature in R. U. R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots). He originally called them labori, from the Latin for ‘work’, but it was his brother, Josef Čapek, who suggested roboti. ', ""https://research.library.fordham.edu/dissertations/AAI13853146/\nThe term 'robot' was ushered into existence by Karel Capek in his play Rossum's Universal Robots. Capek was a Czech science fiction w riter in the early 19th century. Contrary to popular belief, Capek did not invent the word 'robot'. His elder brother Josef Capek derived the word from the Czech noun 'robota' meaning 'labour', and 'robotnik' meaning 'workman' (Dudek & Jenkin 2010).Robots have come a long way from being just machines capable of performing predefined tasks. Today's robots are more intelligent, versatile, and better equipped than they have ever been. But what is a robot? The definition that best fits the work presented in this thesis is from Ronald Arkin's Behaviour Based Robotics: 'An intelligent Robot is a machine able to extract information from its environment and use knowledge about its world to move safely in a meaningful and purposive manner.' A robot's ability to perceive its environment depends on the sensors with which it is outfitted. Modern robots are equipped with a variety of sensors such as sonar, radar, contact sensors, laser range finders, cameras, etc. Robots that are developed following the same general structure as humans are known as humanoid robots.

A virus is a microscopic infectious agent that invades the cells of your body and makes you sick. The flu is often confused with another virus, the common cold, because of the similarity in symptoms, which can include a cough, sore throat, and stuffy nose. However, flu symptoms also include fever, cold sweats, aches throughout the body, headache, exhaustion, and even some gastro-intestinal symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea (1). The flu is highly contagious. Adults are able to spread the virus one day prior to the appearance of symptoms and up to seven days after symptoms begin. Influenza is typically spread via the coughs and sneezes of an infected person (1). Around 200,000 people in the United States are hospitalized each year because of the flu, and of these people, about 36,000 die.  The flu is most serious for the elderly, the very young, or people who have a weakened immune system (1). The Flu Season The flu season in the U.S. can begin as early as October, but usually does not get into full swing until December. The season generally reaches its peak in February and ends in March (2). In the southern hemisphere, however, where winter comes during our summer months, the flu season falls between June and September. In other words, wherever there is winter, there is flu (3). In fact, even its name, 'influenza' may be a reference to its original Italian name, influenza di freddo, meaning 'influence of the cold' (4).

Disneyland Paris is also the only Disney resort outside of the United States to be completely owned by the company. Disneyland Park, opened in 1992, is the original theme park of the complex. A second theme park, Walt Disney Studios Park, opened in 2002. The resort is located on approximately 2,100 hectares (5,200 acres) of land which is being developed under a master agreement with French governmental authorities. About half of the land has been developed, including a planned community, Val d'Europe. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most-visited tourist destination, and the largest single-site employer in France with 17,000 employees. It generated $343 million in profit for Disney in 2023. By 2022, 375 million people had visited the park. Ownership The Walt Disney Company announced a €1 billion plan (equivalent to US$1.25 billion at the time) to rescue the financially struggling Disneyland Paris resort, the Financial Times reported on 6 October 2014.

"", ""In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times. "", ""Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million. After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by 'mutual agreement'. On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as 'La Décima' (Spanish: 'The Tenth,' [la ˈðeθima]). Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals. After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, 'If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, 'We must start again from zero.' After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season. In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals. Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012. Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals, several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015. Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as 'La Duodécima'. The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season. Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season. On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy. In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's 'need for change' as his rationale for departing. Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history, and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage. Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners. "", 'Real Madrid has had the most success in the European Cup, winning the trophy for a record fifteen times. Real was the winner of the inaugural edition of the tournament and remains the only club to win the trophy five times in a row (the first five editions). It also holds the distinction of being the only club to defend the title in the Champions League era, as well as to win it three times in a row.

Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (42), a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored. \x1b[96m[1] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18\x1b[0m. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by the Guinness World Records. Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions. As of March 2023,[update] Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF\nIn 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF\nReal Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million. After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by 'mutual agreement'. On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as 'La Décima' (Spanish: 'The Tenth,' [la ˈðeθima]). Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals. After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, 'If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, 'We must start again from zero.' After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season. In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals. Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012. Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals, several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015. Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as 'La Duodécima'. The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season. Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season. On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy. In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's 'need for change' as his rationale for departing. Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history, and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage. Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF_in_international_football\nReal Madrid has had the most success in the European Cup, winning the trophy for a record fifteen times. Real was the winner of the inaugural edition of the tournament and remains the only club to win the trophy five times in a row (the first five editions). It also holds the distinction of being the only club to defend the title in the Champions League era, as well as to win it three times in a row.

It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India,[b][c] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.[d] The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region,[e] and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.[f] The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, and scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule.[g] Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule.[h] Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.[i] After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm.[j] In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support.[k] The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as 'breakwaters in a storm'.

Consequences of the 1857 Revolt The important consequences of the Revolt of 1857 are as follows: British Crown Came to Power The revolt of 1857 caused the transfer of power from the East India Company to the crown of England and the achievement was possible under the Government of India Act of 1858; under which India came under the direct rule of the English crown. New Structure for the Indian Government The Indian council was formulated with 15 members, nine to serve India for at least ten years, and consisted of a state secretary, which was assisted by the council of India.

Indian Army Reconstruction The Revolt of 1857 instilled a level of fear in the British government.

Q 2. What are the causes of the revolt of 1867? Answer- The discrimination that the lower cast people faced in the east Indian company army. The army practices various higher cast rituals and took measures to segregate the people based on caste. With the increasing expansion plans of the British Government, there was a scope that the power of Nawabs and Zamindars in various places will be reduced or completely taken away. Q 3.

Later, a large-scale rebellion broke out in May and turned into what may be called a full-fledged war in the affected region. This war brought about the end of the British East India Company’s rule in India, and led to the direct rule by the British Government (British Raj) of much of the Indian Subcontinent for the next 90 years.

Feeling their lives are 'irredeemably spoiled' and believing there is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual, true believers seek 'self-renunciation'. Thus, such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives in a larger collective. \x1b[92m[1] Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts\x1b[0m. While mass movements are usually some blend of nationalist, political and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: 'All mass movements are competitive' and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and 'all mass movements are interchangeable'. As examples of the interchangeable nature of mass movements, Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for the same type of angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals.

Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts. While mass movements are usually some blend of nationalist, political and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: 'All mass movements are competitive' and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and 'all mass movements are interchangeable'. As examples of the interchangeable nature of mass movements, Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for the same type of angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals.

Hoffer identifies this communal sensibility as the reappearance of a 'primitive state of being' common among pre-modern cultures. Mass movements also use play-acting and spectacle designed to make the individual feel overwhelmed and awed by their membership in the tribe, as with the massive ceremonial parades and speeches of the Nazis.

Hoffer argues that 'the fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure' and thus uses uncompromising action and personal sacrifice to give meaning to his life. Part 4. Beginning and End Hoffer identifies three main personality types as the leaders of mass movements, 'men of words', 'fanatics', and 'practical men of action'. No person falls exclusively into one category, and their predominant quality may shift over time. Mass movements begin with 'men of words' or 'fault-finding intellectuals' such as clergy, journalists, academics, and students who condemn the established social order (such as Trotsky, Mohammed, and Lenin). The men of words feel unjustly excluded from or mocked and oppressed by the existing powers in society, and they relentlessly criticize or denigrate present institutions. Invariably speaking out in the name of disadvantaged commoners, the man of words is actually motivated by a deep personal grievance. The man of words relentlessly attempts to 'discredit the prevailing creeds' and creates a 'hunger for faith' which is then fed by 'doctrines and slogans of the new faith'. A cadre of devotees gradually develops around the man of words, leading to the next stage in a mass movement. Eventually, the fanatic takes over leadership of the mass movement from the man of words. While the 'creative man of words' finds satisfaction in his literature, philosophy or art, the 'noncreative man of words' feels unrecognized or stifled and thus veers into an extremism against the social order. Though the man of words and the fanatic share a discontent with the world, the fanatic is distinguished by his viciousness and urge to destroy. The fanatic feels fulfilled only in a perpetual struggle for power and change. Examples include Jean-Paul Marat, Maximilien de Robespierre, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler.

For example, proto-Christians were fanatics, predicting the end of the world, condemning idolatry, demanding celibacy and sowing discontent between family members, yet from those roots grew Roman Catholicism, which mimicked the elaborate bureaucratic structure of the Roman Empire, canonized early Christians as saints, and borrowed pagan holidays and rites. In the absence of a practical man of action, the mass movement often withers and dies with the fanatic (Nazism died as a viable mass movement with Hitler's death). There are, of course, rare leaders such as Lincoln, Gandhi, even F.D.R., Churchill, and Nehru. They do not hesitate to harness man's hungers and fears to weld a following and make it zealous unto death in service of a holy cause; but unlike a Hitler, a Stalin, or even a Luther and a Calvin, they are not tempted to use the slime of frustrated souls as mortar in the building of a new world....

Mass movements with a specific goal tend to be shorter-lived and feature less terror and bloodshed (such as the American Revolution).

Plot Facing foreclosure of their homes in the 'Goon Docks' area of Astoria, Oregon to an expanding country club, a group of kids who call themselves 'the Goonies'—Mike 'Mikey' Walsh, Richard 'Data' Wang, Clark 'Mouth' Devereaux, and Lawrence 'Chunk' Cohen—gather for a final weekend together. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies\nPrincipal photography on The Goonies began on October 22, 1984, and lasted five months. An additional six weeks of audio dubbing and recording were used. The shooting script was lengthy, at more than 120 pages, to which several sequences were eventually cut from the final theatrical version. During the film's dénouement, mention is made of an octopus, which refers to a scene that was excised from the final cut. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies\nSome of the on-location filming was done in Astoria. The interior and exterior of the old Clatsop County Jail features as the holding place of Jake Fratelli at the start of the film. (The building was later converted into the Oregon Film Museum, which opened on the 25th anniversary of The Goonies with memorabilia from this and other local films.) The museum where Mikey's father works is, in reality, the Captain George Flavel House Museum. The Walsh family home is a real home on the eastern end of the town, at 368 38th Street. The road leading to the home was closed to tours in 2015. The scenes along the coast were filmed in Oregon, but they were a considerable distance from Astoria. The Goonies bicycle to Ecola State Park (in reality, over 26 miles south of Astoria) and then find the starting location of the map using Haystack Rock as a guide. Underground scenes were filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, including the cavernous set where the Goonies find One-Eyed Willy's ship, which was in Stage 16, one of the largest sound stages in the United States. \x1b[95m[1] The final scene was shot at Goat Rock State Beach in Sonoma County, California\x1b[0m.

Once again, we don’t want to give away too many plot details in case you’ve never seen the film, but just as the action seems to be wrapping up, the sheriff notices something in the distance.'Holy Mary mother of God. Look at that!' he exclaims, as we see One-Eyed Willy’s legendary ship drifting out to sea. And as the Inferno sails into the sunset, a tearful Mikey waves him farewell: 'Bye, Willy. Thanks.'Given that much of the film was shot on location in Oregon, you might be surprised to learn that this part of the movie was shot in California. The final beach scenes after the Goonies escape the tunnel network and their fate is decided were actually filmed on the Sonoma Coast. With its craggy rock formations, Goat Rock Beach is the ideal setting for the conclusion to this thrilling adventure. However, given that it’s over 700 miles away from Astoria, it’s a site you’ll probably want to explore on a separate trip to your main Goonies adventure.

(Though the U.S. brethren of this species are called American bison, they’re often referred to as buffalo.) Then bison hides became a popular fashion item, and the animals were hunted to near extinction by frontiersmen eager to make a buck—until the wares fell out of fashion. By 1902, less than 100 wild bison remained. This threatened the livelihood of Indigenous tribes who relied on the animals for sustenance, warmth, and ceremonial purposes.

So my review is solely for the film and not the adaptation. I think the cinematography and the production design were the film's highlights. The film is stunning from start to finish, a director and cinematographer which has an eye for visuals and puts the nature above everything else except for the actors of course. The West is dirty, muddy and overall an accurate depiction of the Old West.In 1874, Will Andrews, the naive son of a pastor, has dropped out of Harvard and travels to Butcher's Crossing, a tiny frontier town in Kansas built on the buffalo hide trade. Where he joins a team of buffalo hunters on a journey that puts his life and sanity at risk.What's so interesting about this film is the setting and how it delves into the characters psyche, it's a character study of sorts which shows the horrible nature of men and how they shot buffalo for sport. Nicholas Cage portrays the leader of the group, a terrific performance. The skinner, Fred Schneider, is portrayed by Jeremy Bobb and his character is probably the most well written one. He has this small amount of toxic masculinity and is a flawed character but when it comes to nature and animals, he's good. Xander Berkley's character serves no real purpose, making up for scenes which could easily be cut, only purpose he got is the role he got at the camp. My criticism is of the pacing, although I liked it I'm quite sure most will find it off putting. Also some of the writing, dialogue for example is often too modern but works, but also the writing of Nicolas Cage's character Miller, as the writing takes a nose dive for his character after half the film. I've read how some critics find the film's direction to be unfocused and it's noticeable in the second half. I still think the film is good, with Nicolas Cage doing a terrific job as well as the rest of the cast, along with the cinematography never disappointing. With a good message and themes, about masculinity and a warning about what happens when people fail to tread lightly in the natural world, both as a consequence of nature and themselves. Leo Birenberg composed the film and it has a great score.Bear in mind if you watch this film, Butcher's Crossing is flawed around the edges but mostly a good if not a great film. I just wish the second half was as great as the first half, which is not, it becomes a bit strange. Scenes which go hand in hand with the story, the psyche of these men and especially that of Will Andrews. Butcher's Crossing is a hard watch and not much really happens, nor does the characters get fleshed out. Yet, with the low budget that it got and how it uses real buffaloes along with shooting on-location, this film is a great good drama.

"", ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462759/reviews\nI've never read Butcher's Crossing, the novel, but I own it. So my review is solely for the film and not the adaptation. I think the cinematography and the production design were the film's highlights. The film is stunning from start to finish, a director and cinematographer which has an eye for visuals and puts the nature above everything else except for the actors of course. The West is dirty, muddy and overall an accurate depiction of the Old West.In 1874, Will Andrews, the naive son of a pastor, has dropped out of Harvard and travels to Butcher's Crossing, a tiny frontier town in Kansas built on the buffalo hide trade. Where he joins a team of buffalo hunters on a journey that puts his life and sanity at risk.What's so interesting about this film is the setting and how it delves into the characters psyche, it's a character study of sorts which shows the horrible nature of men and how they shot buffalo for sport. Nicholas Cage portrays the leader of the group, a terrific performance. The skinner, Fred Schneider, is portrayed by Jeremy Bobb and his character is probably the most well written one. He has this small amount of toxic masculinity and is a flawed character but when it comes to nature and animals, he's good. Xander Berkley's character serves no real purpose, making up for scenes which could easily be cut, only purpose he got is the role he got at the camp. My criticism is of the pacing, although I liked it I'm quite sure most will find it off putting. Also some of the writing, dialogue for example is often too modern but works, but also the writing of Nicolas Cage's character Miller, as the writing takes a nose dive for his character after half the film. I've read how some critics find the film's direction to be unfocused and it's noticeable in the second half. I still think the film is good, with Nicolas Cage doing a terrific job as well as the rest of the cast, along with the cinematography never disappointing. With a good message and themes, about masculinity and a warning about what happens when people fail to tread lightly in the natural world, both as a consequence of nature and themselves. Leo Birenberg composed the film and it has a great score.Bear in mind if you watch this film, Butcher's Crossing is flawed around the edges but mostly a good if not a great film. I just wish the second half was as great as the first half, which is not, it becomes a bit strange. Scenes which go hand in hand with the story, the psyche of these men and especially that of Will Andrews. Butcher's Crossing is a hard watch and not much really happens, nor does the characters get fleshed out. Yet, with the low budget that it got and how it uses real buffaloes along with shooting on-location, this film is a great good drama.

Present-day distribution of marsupials Introduced Native \x1b[92m[1] Marsupials are a diverse group of mammals belonging to the infraclass Marsupialia\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] They are natively found in Australasia, Wallacea, and the Americas\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] One of the defining features of marsupials is their unique reproductive strategy, where the young are born in a relatively undeveloped state and then nurtured within a pouch on their mother's abdomen\x1b[0m. Living marsupials encompass a wide range of species, including kangaroos, koalas, opossums, Tasmanian devils, wombats, wallabies, and bandicoots, among others. Marsupials constitute a clade stemming from the last common ancestor of extant metatherians, which encompasses all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals. This evolutionary split between placentals and marsupials occurred at least 125 million years ago, possibly dating back over 160 million years to the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous period. \x1b[92m[4] Presently, close to 70% of the 334 extant species of marsupials are concentrated on the Australian continent, including mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and nearby islands\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] The remaining 30% are distributed across the Americas, primarily in South America, with thirteen species in Central America and a single species, the Virginia opossum, inhabiting North America north of Mexico\x1b[0m. Marsupials range in size from a few grams in the long-tailed planigale, to several tonnes in the extinct Diprotodon. The word marsupial comes from marsupium, the technical term for the abdominal pouch. It, in turn, is borrowed from the Latin marsupium and ultimately from the ancient Greek μάρσιππος mársippos, meaning 'pouch'. Anatomy Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) Marsupials have the typical characteristics of mammals—e.g., mammary glands, three middle ear bones, (and ears that usually have tragi, varying in hearing thresholds) and true hair. There are, however, striking differences as well as a number of anatomical features that separate them from eutherians. Most female marsupials have a front pouch, which contains multiple teats for the sustenance of their young. Marsupials also have other common structural features. Ossified patellae are absent in most modern marsupials (though a small number of exceptions are reported) and epipubic bones are present. Marsupials (and monotremes) also lack a gross communication (corpus callosum) between the right and left brain hemispheres. Skull and teeth Marsupials exhibit distinct cranial features compared to placental mammals. Generally, their skulls are relatively small and compact. Notably, they possess frontal holes known as foramen lacrimale situated at the front of the orbit. Marsupials also have enlarged cheekbones that extend further to the rear, and their lower jaw's angular extension (processus angularis) is bent inward toward the center. The hard palate of marsupials contains more openings compared to placental mammals.

In 1816, French zoologist George Cuvier classified all marsupials under the order Marsupialia. In 1997, researcher J. A. W. Kirsch and others accorded infraclass rank to Marsupialia.

Marsupials exist in North America because of migration, a process described in this very chapter, but ignored now when the authors find it inconvenient. Around 3 million years ago, a combination of continental drift and the rising Andes brought South America into contact with North America. For the first time in 50 million years, North American species and South American species came into contact.

Australia boasts the most diverse population of marsupials in the world, with more than 200 different species roaming, climbing and hopping about the continent, out of about 334 such species worldwide. In the United States, it’s a different story. The only marsupial anywhere in the country is the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana). These two- to three-foot-long mammals are the only animals north of Mexico that carry their young in pouches, a characteristic of marsupials that allows their babies to more fully grow and develop before living independently from their mothers. All other mammals have placentas, which nourish the young while still in the womb. After an opossum’s babies are developed enough to live outside its pouch, the mother will continue to carry the young on her back for another month or two while they nurse. #{image.caption} ', 'Scientists believe that modern marsupials, including the opossum, may have actually descended from ancestors that originated in North America. Around 65 million to 68 million years ago, many of these ancestor species went extinct and some migrated to South America, a continent that is now home to about 100 different marsupial species. At that time, South America, Antarctica and Australia were connected as one large landmass; all of Australia’s marsupials may have evolved from a single species that crossed over from South America, whereas the Virginia opossum is believed to have migrated north much later, roughly 3 million years ago.

Function Fluoride is absorbed in the stomach and ', 'Research has indicated that the primary action of fluoride occurs topically after the teeth erupt into the mouth. Ingested fluoride is secreted in the saliva and contributes to topical protection. When enamel is partially demineralized by organic acids, fluoride in the saliva can enhance the remineralization of enamel through its interactions with calcium and phosphate. Fluoride containing remineralized enamel is more resistant to acid attack and demineralization. In salivary concentrations associated with optimum fluoride intake, fluoride has been found to inhibit bacterial enzymes, resulting in reduced acid production by cariogenic bacteria (7, 17). ', 'Dental fluorosis Dental fluorosis, also called enamel fluorosis, is a result of excess fluoride intake during the period of tooth formation, with the critical window of susceptibility being the first eight years of life, as this corresponds to the eruption of the permanent teeth (86). Once the tooth enamel has formed, dental fluorosis cannot develop (87). The mildest form of dental fluorosis is detectable only to the trained observer and is characterized by small opaque white flecks or spots on the enamel of the teeth. Moderate dental fluorosis is characterized by mottling and mild staining of the teeth, and severe dental fluorosis results in marked staining and pitting of the teeth. In its moderate to severe forms, dental fluorosis becomes a cosmetic concern when it affects the incisors and canines (front teeth). Dental fluorosis is a dose-dependent condition, with higher fluoride intakes being associated with more pronounced effects on the teeth. ', 'Most toothpaste sold in the United States contains fluoride in the form of sodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate, most commonly at a level of 1,000 to 1,100 mg/L (about 1.3 mg in a quarter teaspoon, a typical amount of toothpaste used for one brushing) [3]. The amount of fluoride ingested from toothpaste depends on the amount used, the person’s swallowing control, and how often the person uses toothpaste. Estimated typical amounts of fluoride ingested daily from toothpaste are 0.1 mg to 0.25 mg for infants and children age 0 to 5 years, 0.2 to 0.3 mg for children age 6 to 12 years, and 0.1 mg for adults [3]. Fluoride in toothpaste, regardless of its form, is well absorbed [1]. ', 'Fluoride enters the body through water, food or oral hygiene products such as toothpastes, mouthwashes or dental treatments. In some countries in Europe and South America, fluoride may also be found in table salt. Once absorbed in the digestive tract, some fluoride gets stored in the bones and teeth, where it stimulates new bone growth and strengthens teeth. Over time, that strength helps fight tooth decay that occurs during eating. While fluoride has proven benefits for dental health, there is such a thing as too much fluoride—particularly for children. One common problem associated with too much fluoride is fluorosis, a condition that causes a range of changes to the appearance of tooth enamel, from little white spots to brown stains or even a rough, sanded-away appearance on the tooth surface. Fluorosis results from excessive fluoride exposure as a child (while adult teeth are still forming), usually through a combination of fluoride sources such as toothpaste and drinking water. ', 'in the mouth, is also retained and concentrated in plaque. Fluoride works to control early dental caries in several ways. Fluoride concentrated in plaque and saliva inhibits the demineralization of sound enamel and enhances the remineralization (i.e., recovery) of demineralized enamel (12,13). As cariogenic bacteria metabolize carbohydrates and produce acid, fluoride is released from dental plaque in response to lowered pH at the tooth-plaque interface (14). The released fluoride and the fluoride present in saliva are then taken up, along with calcium and phosphate, by de-mineralized enamel to establish an improved enamel crystal structure. This improved structure is more acid resistant and contains more fluoride and less carbonate (12,15--19) (Figure 1). Fluoride is more readily taken up by demineralized enamel than by sound enamel (20). Cycles of demineralization and remineralization continue throughout the lifetime of the tooth. ', 'fluoride toothpaste, or using other fluoride dental products can raise the concentration of fluoride in saliva present in the mouth 100- to 1,000-fold. The concentration returns to previous levels within 1--2 hours but, during this time, saliva serves as an important source of fluoride for concentration in plaque and for tooth remineralization (28). Applying fluoride gel or other products containing a high concentration of fluoride to the teeth leaves a temporary layer of calcium fluoride-like material on the enamel surface. The fluoride in this material is released when the pH drops in the mouth in response to acid production and is available to remineralize enamel (29). In the earliest days of fluoride research, investigators hypothesized that fluoride affects enamel and inhibits dental caries only when incorporated into developing dental enamel (i.e., preeruptively, before the tooth erupts into the mouth) (30,31). Evidence supports this hypothesis ', 'children ingest excess fluoride, from any source, during critical periods of tooth development. The occurrence of enamel fluorosis is reported to be most strongly associated with cumulative fluoride intake during enamel development, but the severity of the condition depends on the dose, duration, and timing of fluoride intake. The transition and early maturation stages of enamel development appear to be most susceptible to the effects of fluoride (51); these stages occur at varying times for different tooth types. For central incisors of the upper jaw, for example, the most sensitive period is estimated at age 15--24 months for boys and age 21--30 months for girls (51,52). Concerns regarding the risk for enamel fluorosis are limited to children aged <8 years; enamel is no longer susceptible once its preeruptive maturation is complete (11). Fluoride sources for children aged <8 years are drinking water, processed ', 'Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that helps to prevent cavities by promoting mineralization and making tooth enamel more resistant to acid. It is added to drinking water around the world—the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends a level of 0.7 parts per million—and all toothpastes backed by the American Dental Association’s Seal of Acceptance contain fluoride. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) named water fluoridation one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century for its role in reducing tooth decay. ', 'Fluorides are properly defined as binary compounds or salts of fluorine and another element. Examples of fluorides include sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride. Both are white solids. Sodium fluoride readily dissolves in water, but calcium fluoride does not. Sodium fluoride is often added to drinking water supplies and to a variety of dental products, including toothpastes and mouth rinses to prevent dental cavities.

Although its role in the prevention of dental caries (tooth decay) is well established, fluoride is not generally considered an essential mineral element because humans do not require it for growth or to sustain life (2). However, if one considers the prevention of chronic disease (dental caries) an important criterion in determining essentiality, then fluoride might well be considered an essential trace element (3). Function Fluoride is absorbed in the stomach and ', 'https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/book/export/html/218\nResearch has indicated that the primary action of fluoride occurs topically after the teeth erupt into the mouth. Ingested fluoride is secreted in the saliva and contributes to topical protection. When enamel is partially demineralized by organic acids, fluoride in the saliva can enhance the remineralization of enamel through its interactions with calcium and phosphate. Fluoride containing remineralized enamel is more resistant to acid attack and demineralization. In salivary concentrations associated with optimum fluoride intake, fluoride has been found to inhibit bacterial enzymes, resulting in reduced acid production by cariogenic bacteria (7, 17). ', 'https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/book/export/html/218\nDental fluorosis Dental fluorosis, also called enamel fluorosis, is a result of excess fluoride intake during the period of tooth formation, with the critical window of susceptibility being the first eight years of life, as this corresponds to the eruption of the permanent teeth (86). Once the tooth enamel has formed, dental fluorosis cannot develop (87). The mildest form of dental fluorosis is detectable only to the trained observer and is characterized by small opaque white flecks or spots on the enamel of the teeth. Moderate dental fluorosis is characterized by mottling and mild staining of the teeth, and severe dental fluorosis results in marked staining and pitting of the teeth. In its moderate to severe forms, dental fluorosis becomes a cosmetic concern when it affects the incisors and canines (front teeth). Dental fluorosis is a dose-dependent condition, with higher fluoride intakes being associated with more pronounced effects on the teeth. ', 'https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Fluoride-HealthProfessional/\nMost toothpaste sold in the United States contains fluoride in the form of sodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate, most commonly at a level of 1,000 to 1,100 mg/L (about 1.3 mg in a quarter teaspoon, a typical amount of toothpaste used for one brushing) [3]. The amount of fluoride ingested from toothpaste depends on the amount used, the person’s swallowing control, and how often the person uses toothpaste. Estimated typical amounts of fluoride ingested daily from toothpaste are 0.1 mg to 0.25 mg for infants and children age 0 to 5 years, 0.2 to 0.3 mg for children age 6 to 12 years, and 0.1 mg for adults [3]. Fluoride in toothpaste, regardless of its form, is well absorbed [1]. ', 'https://www.cancercenter.com/risk-factors/fluoride\nFluoride enters the body through water, food or oral hygiene products such as toothpastes, mouthwashes or dental treatments. In some countries in Europe and South America, fluoride may also be found in table salt. Once absorbed in the digestive tract, some fluoride gets stored in the bones and teeth, where it stimulates new bone growth and strengthens teeth. Over time, that strength helps fight tooth decay that occurs during eating. While fluoride has proven benefits for dental health, there is such a thing as too much fluoride—particularly for children. One common problem associated with too much fluoride is fluorosis, a condition that causes a range of changes to the appearance of tooth enamel, from little white spots to brown stains or even a rough, sanded-away appearance on the tooth surface. Fluorosis results from excessive fluoride exposure as a child (while adult teeth are still forming), usually through a combination of fluoride sources such as toothpaste and drinking water.

Fluoride works to control early dental caries in several ways. \x1b[1;35;40m[2] Fluoride concentrated in plaque and saliva inhibits the demineralization of sound enamel and enhances the remineralization (i.e., recovery) of demineralized enamel\x1b[0m (12,13). As cariogenic bacteria metabolize carbohydrates and produce acid, fluoride is released from dental plaque in response to lowered pH at the tooth-plaque interface (14). The released fluoride and the fluoride present in saliva are then taken up, along with calcium and phosphate, by de-mineralized enamel to establish an improved enamel crystal structure. This improved structure is more acid resistant and contains more fluoride and less carbonate (12,15--19) (Figure 1). Fluoride is more readily taken up by demineralized enamel than by sound enamel (20). Cycles of demineralization and remineralization continue throughout the lifetime of the tooth. ', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm\nfluoride toothpaste, or using other fluoride dental products can raise the concentration of fluoride in saliva present in the mouth 100- to 1,000-fold. The concentration returns to previous levels within 1--2 hours but, during this time, saliva serves as an important source of fluoride for concentration in plaque and for tooth remineralization (28). Applying fluoride gel or other products containing a high concentration of fluoride to the teeth leaves a temporary layer of calcium fluoride-like material on the enamel surface. The fluoride in this material is released when the pH drops in the mouth in response to acid production and is available to remineralize enamel (29). In the earliest days of fluoride research, investigators hypothesized that fluoride affects enamel and inhibits dental caries only when incorporated into developing dental enamel (i.e., preeruptively, before the tooth erupts into the mouth) (30,31). Evidence supports this hypothesis ', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm\nchildren ingest excess fluoride, from any source, during critical periods of tooth development. The occurrence of enamel fluorosis is reported to be most strongly associated with cumulative fluoride intake during enamel development, but the severity of the condition depends on the dose, duration, and timing of fluoride intake. The transition and early maturation stages of enamel development appear to be most susceptible to the effects of fluoride (51); these stages occur at varying times for different tooth types. For central incisors of the upper jaw, for example, the most sensitive period is estimated at age 15--24 months for boys and age 21--30 months for girls (51,52). Concerns regarding the risk for enamel fluorosis are limited to children aged <8 years; enamel is no longer susceptible once its preeruptive maturation is complete (11). Fluoride sources for children aged <8 years are drinking water, processed ', 'https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2020/february/fluorosis.html\nFluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that helps to prevent cavities by promoting mineralization and making tooth enamel more resistant to acid. It is added to drinking water around the world—the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends a level of 0.7 parts per million—and all toothpastes backed by the American Dental Association’s Seal of Acceptance contain fluoride. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) named water fluoridation one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century for its role in reducing tooth decay.

You go in with the best intentions, but the more money you spend on the movie, the more people you have to answer to. If you're working for a studio or a lot of independent producers, chances are you'll have to compromise your vision. Unless you are entitled to make a director's cut. Final cut on a movie means that no matter what, the director gets to say what is released. Very few people in Hollywood have this. Most times, the studio will release their version, and then much later either on Blu-ray or digital, the director will release their version. That's where the director's cut comes into play. But what is the definition of a director's cut? And how does it happen in Hollywood? Today we're going to define that term, look at a few examples, and talk about how directors get their vision to the audience. 'Aliens'Credit: 20th Century Fox What Is a Director's Cut? (Definition and Examples) These are important terms to know if you want to work in Hollywood. Let's dig deep into definitions before we get into the examples. Director's Cut Definition A director's cut is \x1b[95m[1] a version of a film that represents the director's own approved edit\x1b[0m. A director's cut may include \x1b[95m[2] scenes that were not in the theatrical cut of the movie, which was altered by the studio for time or content\x1b[0m. What Does the Director’s Cut Mean? It means that this version of a film \x1b[95m[3] has been edited in exact accordance with the director's wishes\x1b[0m. \x1b[95m[4] They have decided on the order of scenes, cuts, and length, without any interference from producers or studios\x1b[0m. Maybe scenes that got cut from the theatrical release get added back to the director's cut. Where did Director's Cut come from? According to Wikipedia, 'The trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the 'director's cut' of The Wild Bunch was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences.' It evolved from there with directors and studios battling it out over the decades. What Is Final Cut? Final cut means that a director takes on a project knowing they will be allowed to release the director's cut to the public without interference. If a director has a final cut, there can be no fight with the studio over what goes into the movie. Only their say matters. Credit: Warner Bros. What Is the Difference Between a Theatrical Cut and Director's Cut? The theatrical cut of a movie is what the studio has decided to release to theaters. Sometimes, but not every time, the producers or studio will create their own edit to change a director's vision. They may cut out sex, violence, or just trim movies for time, so they can show more often. The director's cut means that the director chose what cut is on the screen. What's Different Between the Director's Cut and the Extended Cut? An extended cut of a movie might add scenes cut for rating or time. They are often released by the studio to capitalize on a big title, like a comedy, where more outrageous scenes could be added. If the director wanted them added in, then they would be in the director's cut. Lots of times, extended cuts are made without the director, unless specifically advertised. Something like The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition was made with director Peter Jackson, and it bridges the gap between extended and director's cut. Credit: New Line CinemaDirector's Cut Examples There are lots of examples of director's cuts out there. One that comes to mind immediately is that of Blade Runner, which Ridley Scott famously keeps releasing director's cuts of, as he goes back and tweaks voiceover, dream sequences, and lots of other nuances. Scott also released a far superior director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven, which turned the average film into a masterpiece.

This sometimes means a happier ending or less ambiguity, or excluding scenes that would earn a more audience-restricting rating, but more often means that the film is simply shortened to provide more screenings per day. With the rise of home video, the phrase became more generically used as a marketing term (including media such as comic books and music albums, neither of which actually have directors), and the most commonly seen form of director's cut is a cut where extra scenes and characters are added in, often making the director's cut considerably longer than the final cut. Origin of the phrase Traditionally, the 'director's cut' is not, by definition, the director's ideal or preferred cut. The editing process of a film is broken into stages: First is the assembly/rough cut, where all selected takes are put together in the order in which they should appear in the film. Next, the editor's cut is reduced from the rough cut; the editor may be guided by their own choices or following notes from the director or producers. Eventually is the final cut, which actually gets released or broadcast. In between the editor's cut and the final cut can come any number of fine cuts, including the director's cut.

Inception The trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the 'director's cut' of The Wild Bunch was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences. The theatrical release of the film had cut 10 minutes to get an R rating, but this cut was hailed as superior and has now become the definitive one. Other early examples include George Lucas's first two films being re-released following the success of Star Wars, in cuts which more closely resembled his vision, or Peter Bogdanovich re-cutting The Last Picture Show several times. Charlie Chaplin also re-released all of his films in the 1970s, several of which were re-cut (Chaplin's re-release of The Gold Rush in the 1940s is almost certainly the earliest prominent example of a director's re-cut film being released to the public). A theatrical re-release of Close Encounters of the Third Kind used the phrase 'Special Edition' to describe a cut which was closer to Spielberg's intent but had a compromised ending demanded by the studio. As the home video industry rose in the early 1980s, video releases of director's cuts were sometimes created for the small but dedicated cult fan market. Los Angeles cable station Z Channel is also cited as significant in the popularization of alternate cuts. Early examples of films released in this manner include Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, where a longer cut was recalled from theatres but subsequently shown on cable and eventually released to home video; James Cameron's Aliens, where a video release restored 20 minutes the studio had insisted on cutting; Cameron also voluntarily made cuts to the theatrical version of The Abyss for pacing but restored them for a video release, and most famously, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, where an alternate workprint version was released to fan acclaim, ultimately resulting in the 1992 recut. Scott later recut the film once more, releasing a version dubbed 'The Final Cut' in 2007.

The engrossed copy is not the first published Declaration of Independence. The first published version is known as the Dunlap broadside and was signed only by John Hancock, who was the president of the Continental Congress, and Charles Thomson, its secretary. It was set in type and printed on July 4, 1776, then distributed to the colonies. After the Dunlap broadside was published, the Declaration was handwritten on a piece of parchment and confirmed by the members of the congress to be identical to the typeset original. This handwritten version is the engrossed copy. It—or an engraved copy of it made in the early 19th century, when the original started to fade—is what you are most likely used to seeing in textbooks or patriotic montages. Unlike the Dunlap broadside, the engrossed copy bears the names of 56 signers, including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams. It’s currently on display at the National Archives. "", 'We know this much: You can’t fit 56 Hancock-sized signatures onto the parchment. If all 56 men signed the declaration at that size, the document would have needed approximately 5.5 more inches of vertical space to accommodate all the names—even with crammed spacing and slim margins: Advertisement If Hancock had wanted all 56 signatories to sign at maximum size and still have everyone fit, his signature and theirs should have been closer to 3.1 square inches in size. This is about half the size of Hancock’s original, though it’s larger than most of the signatures on the document. It’s roughly in line with William Ellery’s autograph, which is the second largest on the Declaration. ', ""The engrossed parchment is what most people think of as 'the' Declaration of Independence: the document on display in the National Archives, alongside the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights. It is a parchment sheet measuring 29 3/4 inches high by 24 1/4 inches wide. Unlike paper, parchment was a sturdier, longer-lasting material, and was also used for the Articles of Confederation, United States Constitution, and Bill of Rights. To 'fairly engross' means to copy in large, legible script, to create an official copy of a document. The person tasked with engrossing the Declaration of Independence was most likely Timothy Matlack. No official record exists, so historians rely on comparisons of Matlack's handwriting and his position as an assistant to Secretary of Congress Charles Thomson as evidence. Matlack used an English Roundhand script, and neatly wrote with a quill pen, making only two errors. He also engrossed the 1774 Petition to the King and George Washington's Commission as Commander-in-Chief. National Treasure fans may remember Matlack's name from a riddle Nicholas Cage's character discovered in the pipe from the Charlotte: 'The legend writ, the stain affected. The key in Silence undetected. Fifty-five in iron pen, Mr. Matlack cannot offend.' Technically it should be fifty-six, but if we start quibbling with National Treasure, this blog will be too long... And for the record, here is what the back of the engrossed parchment looks like (no treasure map...). When was the Declaration of Independence signed? Historians believe that the Declaration of Independence was signed by the majority of the delegates on August 2nd, 1776. Timothy Matlack engrossed the Declaration on parchment sometime between July 19th and August 1st. According to the Journals of the Continental Congress, on August 2nd,'The declaration of independence being engrossed and compared at the table was signed.'49 delegates most likely signed on August 2nd, including President of Congress John Hancock. Seven delegates were absent from Continental Congress on August 2nd, and must have signed later. Due to his exclusion from the Goddard broadside, we believe Thomas McKean was the last delegate to sign, sometime after January 1777. Who signed? 56 delegates (including President of Congress John Hancock) representing each of the United States signed the Declaration of Independence. But as we explored in No John Trumbull, not every signer was present for the debates and the vote for independence, and not everyone who voted for independence went on to sign the engrossed parchment.Eight men who were present on July 2nd never signed the Declaration, including most of the Pennsylvanians who either abstained from voting or voted against independence: John Dickinson, Charles Humphreys, and Thomas Willing. The other Pennsylvanian delegate who abstained -- Robert Morris -- signed on August 2nd. The New York delegation abstained from voting on July 2nd, and four delegates -- John Alsop, George Clinton, Robert R. Livingston, and Henry Wisner -- never signed the Declaration of Independence. Remember, Robert R. Livingston was a member of the Committee of Five, and yet not a signer. Conversely, eight men signed who weren't even elected to Congress until after July 4th: Matthew Thornton (NH), William Williams (CT), Benjamin Rush (PA), George Clymer (PA), James Smith (PA), George Taylor (PA), George Ross (PA), and Charles Carroll of Carrollton (MD). Thornton famously requested permission to sign the Declaration of Independence, even though he wasn't elected to the Continental Congress until September 1776.The one delegate who voted for independence and never signed the Declaration of Independence was John Rogers of Maryland. The one delegate who voted against independence and still signed the Declaration of Independence was George Read of Delaware. "", ""To begin, the legend of Hancock signing his name large enough for King George III to read it without his spectacles is just that -- legend. There is no contemporary evidence for what Hancock said as he signed, and at the very least, we know that the engrossed parchment was not sent to King George III. But Hancock did sign front and center, and it is assumed that, as President of Congress, he signed the Declaration of Independence first. The next signature would have likely been Josiah Bartlett of New Hampshire. Perhaps it was his signature that started the trend of signing slightly smaller than Hancock. Besides the spectacles comment, there are a number of quotations from the signing for which we have no evidence. Stephen Hopkins declaring 'My hand trembles, but my heart does not!' Benjamin Franklin's acknowledgement that, 'We must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.' The rotund Benjamin Harrison commenting that, should they hang, he would have the advantage of dying quickly while skinnier delegate Elbridge Gerry would 'kick in the air half an hour after it is over with me.' Though there may have been one-liners such as these and moments of levity, according to Benjamin Rush, the mood was somber on August 2nd. In a letter to John Adams in 1811, Rush recalled, 'the solicitude and labors, and fears, and sorrows and sleepless nights of the men who projected, proposed, defended, and Subscribed the declaration of independance...' and asked Adams, 'Do you recollect the pensive and awful silence which pervaded the house when we were called up, one after another, to the table of the President of Congress, to subscribe what was believed by many at that time to be our own death warrants?' "", 'By the time I make my way to the hallowed hall, the crowds have cleared and I have the opportunity to survey the 56 signatures of the men who composed the Second Continental Congress. One name stands out among them and it just so happens that it belongs to my namesake, John Hancock. His signature has become synonymous with patriotism and defiance in the face of tyranny. But very few people from the first two generations of Americans ever viewed the actual document that signaled the break from England. For them, the Declaration was broadcast aloud from the steps of their local government buildings or as printed text. The great portion of citizens were provided with a printed copy of the Declaration of Independence, not the original parchment that was once handled by our founders. John Hancock by Alonzo Chapel.

The signing of the document became just as significant as Congress’s votes to approve the measure, although the signing did not commence until August 2. Those 56 members of Congress have become figures of immense historical significance and elevated in public memory above all of the other delegates at that time. And dramatic tales of how they put pen to parchment have become almost mythical in nature. Soon after the Colonial Revival of the late 1800s, many historians became skeptical of these stories. One narrative that received particular scrutiny was John Hancock’s motivation for producing his large signature. One anecdote provides the following: ', ""Of the fifty-five delegates who attended the convention 34 were lawyers, 8 had signed the Declaration of Independence, and almost half were Revolutionary War veterans. The remaining members were planters, educators, ministers, physicians, financiers, judges and merchants. About a quarter of them were large land owners and all of them held some type of public office (39 were former Congressmen and 8 were present or past governors). William Few of Georgia was the only member to represent the yeoman farmer class which comprised the majority of the population of the country. Nineteen of the members who were chosen to represent their state never attended a meeting. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania was known as the 'Sage of the Constitutional Convention.'

The engrossed copy is not the first published Declaration of Independence. The first published version is known as the Dunlap broadside and was signed only by John Hancock, who was the president of the Continental Congress, and Charles Thomson, its secretary. It was set in type and printed on July 4, 1776, then distributed to the colonies. After the Dunlap broadside was published, the Declaration was handwritten on a piece of parchment and confirmed by the members of the congress to be identical to the typeset original. This handwritten version is the engrossed copy. It—or an engraved copy of it made in the early 19th century, when the original started to fade—is what you are most likely used to seeing in textbooks or patriotic montages. Unlike the Dunlap broadside, the engrossed copy bears the names of 56 signers, including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams. It’s currently on display at the National Archives. "", 'http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2014/08/john_hancock_s_declaration_of_independence_signature_was_it_too_big.html\nWe know this much: You can’t fit 56 Hancock-sized signatures onto the parchment. If all 56 men signed the declaration at that size, the document would have needed approximately 5.5 more inches of vertical space to accommodate all the names—even with crammed spacing and slim margins: Advertisement If Hancock had wanted all 56 signatories to sign at maximum size and still have everyone fit, his signature and theirs should have been closer to 3.1 square inches in size. This is about half the size of Hancock’s original, though it’s larger than most of the signatures on the document. It’s roughly in line with William Ellery’s autograph, which is the second largest on the Declaration. ', ""https://declaration.fas.harvard.edu/blog/signing\nThe engrossed parchment is what most people think of as 'the' Declaration of Independence: the document on display in the National Archives, alongside the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights. It is a parchment sheet measuring 29 3/4 inches high by 24 1/4 inches wide. Unlike paper, parchment was a sturdier, longer-lasting material, and was also used for the Articles of Confederation, United States Constitution, and Bill of Rights. To 'fairly engross' means to copy in large, legible script, to create an official copy of a document. The person tasked with engrossing the Declaration of Independence was most likely Timothy Matlack. No official record exists, so historians rely on comparisons of Matlack's handwriting and his position as an assistant to Secretary of Congress Charles Thomson as evidence. Matlack used an English Roundhand script, and neatly wrote with a quill pen, making only two errors. He also engrossed the 1774 Petition to the King and George Washington's Commission as Commander-in-Chief. National Treasure fans may remember Matlack's name from a riddle Nicholas Cage's character discovered in the pipe from the Charlotte: 'The legend writ, the stain affected. The key in Silence undetected. Fifty-five in iron pen, Mr. Matlack cannot offend.' Technically it should be fifty-six, but if we start quibbling with National Treasure, this blog will be too long... And for the record, here is what the back of the engrossed parchment looks like (no treasure map...). When was the Declaration of Independence signed? Historians believe that the Declaration of Independence was signed by the majority of the delegates on August 2nd, 1776. Timothy Matlack engrossed the Declaration on parchment sometime between July 19th and August 1st. According to the Journals of the Continental Congress, on August 2nd,'The declaration of independence being engrossed and compared at the table was signed.'49 delegates most likely signed on August 2nd, including President of Congress John Hancock. Seven delegates were absent from Continental Congress on August 2nd, and must have signed later. Due to his exclusion from the Goddard broadside, we believe Thomas McKean was the last delegate to sign, sometime after January 1777. Who signed? 56 delegates (including President of Congress John Hancock) representing each of the United States signed the Declaration of Independence. But as we explored in No John Trumbull, not every signer was present for the debates and the vote for independence, and not everyone who voted for independence went on to sign the engrossed parchment.Eight men who were present on July 2nd never signed the Declaration, including most of the Pennsylvanians who either abstained from voting or voted against independence: John Dickinson, Charles Humphreys, and Thomas Willing.

It was the first a cappella song to reach number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, a position it held for two weeks. Originally released in conjunction with the film Cocktail, the song peaked at number-one on September 24, 1988, displacing 'Sweet Child o' Mine' by Guns N' Roses. The song also peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart and number seven on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. It hit number one in Australia and stayed there for 7 weeks. It was also a hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number two during its fifth week on the UK Singles Chart. In Canada, the song reached number one in its eighth week. One critic noted it as a 'formula for facing life's trials'. At the 1989 Grammy Awards, 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' won the awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. In 2024, the single was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'.

Six weeks before it topped the Hot 100, Bobby McFerrin’s 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' became the ultimate left-field #1, 30 years ago this week. The first chart-topper without any instrumentation, it sounded, almost by definition, unlike anything else on the radio. (Haters of UB40’s 'Red Red Wine,' which hit #1 a month later, may disagree.) Like 'Kokomo,' 'Don’t Worry' was created by the product of a musical family, offered ersatz island flavor, and promised some sort of getaway from modern ills. (As such, it was anathema to Chuck D, who dissed the song in Public Enemy’s earthshaking 'Fight The Power.') Unlike the Beach Boys, however, McFerrin essentially declined to attempt a suitable follow-up. Already a Grammy-garlanded jazz musician, he quickly returned to that world rather than, say, guesting on Baywatch. "", ""It was a phrase popularized by Meher Baba, an Indian spiritual master who had developed a sizable American following prior to his death in 1969. I say 'phrase' and not 'saying' because, in 1925, Meher Baba ceased speaking. 'Don’t worry, be happy' was something he would send his Western adherents, and because they were Western, the phrase started appearing on posters and cards. (Wikipedia claims that McFerrin was inspired by one such poster hanging in jazz duo Tuck & Patti’s apartment. That lacks a citation, but it’s fun to think of think of 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' being born in St. Vincent’s aunt and uncle’s home.) McFerrin reportedly called it 'a pretty neat philosophy in four words,' and he wasn’t alone in thinking so. Meher Baba’s most famous devotee was the Who’s Pete Townshend, who structured an entire rock opera (1969’s Tommy) around the man’s teachings, and later titled a song after his two heroes: Baba and Terry Riley. Thankfully, the phrase didn’t send McFerrin off to write his own 'Underture.' Instead, he created possibly the sunniest song about survival ever written. He tosses out scenarios straight from the blues — no girlfriend, late rent, no cash — and smashes them with optimism straight from the spiritual tradition. By now, McFerrin was an old hand at overdubs, and he fleshed out the simple, lilting topline with a host of embellishments. There’s the soothing multi-tracked coos, straight out of doo-wop. There’s the infernally catchy whistling that starts the track, and his astounding approximation of a popping bassline. And, of course, there’s the vague Jamaican syncopation of his pats and snaps, and the even more vague Caribbean accent he affects — you could make the perverse argument that 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' was America’s first reggae #1. According to McFerrin’s longtime manager and producer Linda Goldstein, he was actually going for a Spanish accent, inspired by a recent viewing of The Three Amigos. True or not, America heard Jamaican — a YouTube upload of the song, credited to Bob Marley, has over 100 million views. Marley never recorded 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' — due to dying in 1981, for starters — but you can still find people who swear he performed the song. "", ""But in 1988 as in 2018, 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' sounds like nothing else. Because the music industry likes nothing more than pop songs with a high degree of professionalism, McFerrin added three more Grammys to his collection: Pop Vocal Performance (Male), Record Of The Year, and Song Of The Year. It didn’t hurt that the song’s accompanying video was brutally charming. Alongside comedians Bill Irwin and Robin Williams, McFerrin goofs around a gigantic apartment, shoeless in a white tux.

It was the first a cappella song to reach number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, a position it held for two weeks. Originally released in conjunction with the film Cocktail, the song peaked at number-one on September 24, 1988, displacing 'Sweet Child o' Mine' by Guns N' Roses. The song also peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart and number seven on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. It hit number one in Australia and stayed there for 7 weeks. It was also a hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number two during its fifth week on the UK Singles Chart. In Canada, the song reached number one in its eighth week. One critic noted it as a 'formula for facing life's trials'. At the 1989 Grammy Awards, 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' won the awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. In 2024, the single was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'. Background Meher Baba, who often used the phrase 'Don't worry, be happy' Indian mystic Meher Baba (1894–1969) often used the expression 'Don't worry, be happy' when cabling his followers in the West, and the expression was printed on inspirational cards and posters during the 1960s. In 1988, McFerrin noticed a similar poster in the apartment of jazz duo Tuck & Patti in San Francisco,[citation needed] and he was inspired by the expression's charm and simplicity. He wrote and recorded the song for his album Simple Pleasures and it was included in the soundtrack of the movie Cocktail, which subsequently led to it becoming a hit single the next year. Composition and recording 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' (2008) A 24-second audio sample of Bobby McFerrin's 'Don't Worry, Be Happy'. Problems playing this file? See media help. The 'instruments' in the a cappella song are entirely overdubbed voice parts and other sounds made by McFerrin, using no instruments at all; McFerrin also sings with an affected accent, though he stated that 'I hate to go so far as to say it's Jamaican. It was heavily influenced by Juan's Mexican Restaurant, which was just around the corner from the studio.' 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' is written in the key of B major. The song was recorded by McFerrin at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California, using only eight tracks. McFerrin sang his vocal parts into his preferred microphone, a Neumann U 87. Critical reception Kieran McCarthy of AllMusic expected that the song would 'probably remain prevalent in pop culture as long as humans speak English and play music.' Pan-European magazine Music & Media picked it as Single of the Week, writing 'Cool a capella by this unusual artist. Uncomplicated music stripped down to the basics, but missing absolutely nothing. This recording will appeal to everybody who is on the lookout for something different. With the reggae-style vocals and a snappy rhythm, this Linda Goldstein produced US top 10 single is a novelty record of considerable substance.' Music video \x1b[92m[1] The comedic original music video for the song, directed by Drew Takahashi, stars McFerrin, Robin Williams, and Bill Irwin\x1b[0m, and is somewhat shorter than the album version. Awards At the 1989 Grammy Awards, 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' won the awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. Impact and legacy The song is ranked No. 31 on VH1's '100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the '80s' and also appears on Rolling Stone's list of the 15 Best Whistling Songs of All Time. It was featured at #301 in the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment for the Arts' 'Songs of the Century' in 2001. However, in 2011, 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' was named as the worst song of all time by Village Voice critic Michael Musto, and it topped Q100 DJ Bert Weiss's list of tracks he would forever ban from radio. In the '50 Worst Songs Ever', Blender wrote 'it's difficult to think of a song more likely to plunge you into suicidal despondency than this' and it lambasted its 'appalling' lyrics. 400,000‡ United States (RIAA) Gold 500,000^ ^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. Use by the George Bush campaign The song was used in George H. W. Bush's 1988 U.S. presidential election as Bush's 1988 official presidential campaign song, and it was used without Bobby McFerrin's permission or endorsement. In reaction, McFerrin (a Democrat) publicly protested that particular use of his song, including stating that he was going to vote against Bush, and he completely dropped the song from his own performance repertoire to make the point even clearer. The Bush campaign then reportedly desisted from use of the song.

Six weeks before it topped the Hot 100, Bobby McFerrin’s 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' became the ultimate left-field #1, 30 years ago this week. The first chart-topper without any instrumentation, it sounded, almost by definition, unlike anything else on the radio. (Haters of UB40’s 'Red Red Wine,' which hit #1 a month later, may disagree.) Like 'Kokomo,' 'Don’t Worry' was created by the product of a musical family, offered ersatz island flavor, and promised some sort of getaway from modern ills. (As such, it was anathema to Chuck D, who dissed the song in Public Enemy’s earthshaking 'Fight The Power.') Unlike the Beach Boys, however, McFerrin essentially declined to attempt a suitable follow-up. Already a Grammy-garlanded jazz musician, he quickly returned to that world rather than, say, guesting on Baywatch. "", ""https://www.stereogum.com/2014983/dont-worry-be-happy-bobby-mcferrin-story/columns/sounding-board/\nIt was a phrase popularized by Meher Baba, an Indian spiritual master who had developed a sizable American following prior to his death in 1969. I say 'phrase' and not 'saying' because, in 1925, Meher Baba ceased speaking. 'Don’t worry, be happy' was something he would send his Western adherents, and because they were Western, the phrase started appearing on posters and cards. (Wikipedia claims that McFerrin was inspired by one such poster hanging in jazz duo Tuck & Patti’s apartment. That lacks a citation, but it’s fun to think of think of 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' being born in St. Vincent’s aunt and uncle’s home.) McFerrin reportedly called it 'a pretty neat philosophy in four words,' and he wasn’t alone in thinking so. Meher Baba’s most famous devotee was the Who’s Pete Townshend, who structured an entire rock opera (1969’s Tommy) around the man’s teachings, and later titled a song after his two heroes: Baba and Terry Riley. Thankfully, the phrase didn’t send McFerrin off to write his own 'Underture.' Instead, he created possibly the sunniest song about survival ever written. He tosses out scenarios straight from the blues — no girlfriend, late rent, no cash — and smashes them with optimism straight from the spiritual tradition. By now, McFerrin was an old hand at overdubs, and he fleshed out the simple, lilting topline with a host of embellishments. There’s the soothing multi-tracked coos, straight out of doo-wop. There’s the infernally catchy whistling that starts the track, and his astounding approximation of a popping bassline. And, of course, there’s the vague Jamaican syncopation of his pats and snaps, and the even more vague Caribbean accent he affects — you could make the perverse argument that 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' was America’s first reggae #1. According to McFerrin’s longtime manager and producer Linda Goldstein, he was actually going for a Spanish accent, inspired by a recent viewing of The Three Amigos. True or not, America heard Jamaican — a YouTube upload of the song, credited to Bob Marley, has over 100 million views. Marley never recorded 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' — due to dying in 1981, for starters — but you can still find people who swear he performed the song. "", ""https://www.stereogum.com/2014983/dont-worry-be-happy-bobby-mcferrin-story/columns/sounding-board/\nBut in 1988 as in 2018, 'Don’t Worry Be Happy' sounds like nothing else. Because the music industry likes nothing more than pop songs with a high degree of professionalism, McFerrin added three more Grammys to his collection: Pop Vocal Performance (Male), Record Of The Year, and Song Of The Year. It didn’t hurt that the song’s accompanying video was brutally charming. Alongside comedians Bill Irwin and Robin Williams, McFerrin goofs around a gigantic apartment, shoeless in a white tux. (At one point, he lounges on a limo that Williams … tries to buy drugs from? It’s unclear.) He was an entertainer in full, a point that was hammered home on the Grammy telecast, when he and Billy Crystal performed a hammy yet technically brilliant bit on the history of music.

It was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH) and operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei). It was named after Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who was president of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. Filled with hydrogen, it caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst. The accident caused 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen) among the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), and an additional fatality on the ground. The disaster was the subject of newsreel coverage, photographs and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. A variety of theories have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The publicity shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era.

"", ""Hindenburg had a duralumin structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads along its length, with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship's outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater's skins.

Dining room Lounge, with the world map painted on the wall Hindenburg's "", ""Four years after construction began in 1932, Hindenburg made its maiden test flight from the Zeppelin dockyards at Friedrichshafen on March 4, 1936, with 87 passengers and crew aboard. These included the Zeppelin Company chairman, Dr. Hugo Eckener, as commander, former World War I Zeppelin commander Lt. Col. Joachim Breithaupt representing the German Air Ministry, the Zeppelin Company's eight airship captains, 47 other crew members, and 30 dockyard employees who flew as passengers. Harold G. Dick was the only non-Luftschiffbau representative aboard. Although the name Hindenburg had been quietly selected by Eckener over a year earlier, only the airship's formal registration number (D-LZ129) and the five Olympic rings (promoting the 1936 Summer Olympics to be held in Berlin that August) were displayed on the hull during its trial flights. As the airship passed over Munich on its second trial flight the next afternoon, the city's Lord Mayor, Karl Fiehler, asked Eckener by radio the LZ129's name, to which he replied 'Hindenburg'. On March 23, Hindenburg made its first passenger and mail flight, carrying 80 reporters from Friedrichshafen to Löwenthal. The ship flew over Lake Constance with Graf Zeppelin. "", ""On October 8, 1936, Hindenburg made a 10.5 hour flight (the 'Millionaires Flight') over New England carrying 72 wealthy and influential passengers including financier and future U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winthrop W. Aldrich, his 28-year-old nephew Nelson Rockefeller, who became the Governor of New York and, later, Vice President of the United States, various German and American government officials and military officers, as well as key figures in the aviation industry, including Juan Trippe, founder and Chief Executive of Pan American Airways, and World War I flying ace Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, president of Eastern Airlines. The ship arrived at Boston by noon and returned to Lakehurst at 5:22 pm before making its final transatlantic flight of the season back to Frankfurt. "", ""Hindenburg also had an experimental aircraft hook-on trapeze similar to the one on the U.S. Navy Goodyear–Zeppelin built airships Akron and Macon. This was intended to allow customs officials to be flown out to Hindenburg to process passengers before landing and to retrieve mail from the ship for early delivery. Experimental hook-ons and takeoffs, piloted by Ernst Udet, were attempted on March 11 and April 27, 1937, but were not very successful, owing to turbulence around the hook-up trapeze. The loss of the ship ended all prospects of further testing. Final flight: May 3–6, 1937 Main article: Hindenburg disaster After making the first South American flight of the 1937 season in late March, Hindenburg left Frankfurt for Lakehurst on the evening of 3 May, on its first scheduled round trip between Europe and North America that season. Although strong headwinds slowed the crossing, the flight had otherwise proceeded routinely as it approached for a landing three days later. Hindenburg's arrival on 6 May was delayed for several hours to avoid a line of thunderstorms passing over Lakehurst, but around 7:00 pm the airship was cleared for its final approach to the Naval Air Station, which it made at an altitude of 200 m (660 ft) with Captain Max Pruss in command. At 7:21 pm a pair of landing lines were dropped from the nose of the ship and were grabbed hold of by ground handlers. Four minutes later, at 7:25 pm Hindenburg burst into flames and dropped to the ground in a little over half a minute. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crew aboard, 13 passengers and 22 crew died, as well as one member of the ground crew, a total of 36 lives lost. Herbert Morrison's commentary of the incident became a classic of audio history. "", ""On May 6, 1937, the rigid German airship Hindenburg arrived at its Lakehurst, NJ, Naval Air Station destination after departing Frankfurt, Germany 3 days earlier. A crowded landing field of newspaper and radio journalists, film and still camera people, family, friends, and ground crew waited for the airship despite arriving hours behind schedule. As the Hindenburg prepared to dock with its mooring mast, it suddenly burst into flames forcing passengers and crew to jump from windows to escape the inferno. In seconds, the airship was completely destroyed and 36 people were dead. The disaster was immortalized as the first major aviation accident captured by photographs, sound recordings, and motion picture film. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH built the rigid passenger airship Hindenburg (LZ129) between 1931 and 1936 at its facility in Friedrichshafen, Germany. The first in its class of rigid airships, the Hindenburg remains the largest commercial airship ever built and flown, measuring nearly 804 feet long and 135 feet in diameter. Constructed using treated cotton canvas fabric stretched over an aluminum alloy frame, the 242 ton airship was held aloft by more than 7 million cubic feet of hydrogen gas. Four diesel-driven propeller engines drove the zeppelin to speeds of up to 84 miles per hour, while carrying 50 passengers, 60 or more crew members, and more than 21,000 pounds of cargo. Completed at the height of the Great Depression, passengers nevertheless eagerly paid approximately $450 for a one-way ticket—more than $8,750 in 2022 dollars—for the 2- to 3-day voyage between Frankfurt, Germany, and Lakehurst, NJ. Sleeping quarters were spartan, consisting of private cabins with cots or bunk beds and a shared bathroom, but the airship's other amenities rivaled the finest ocean liners.

Hindenburg's arrival on 6 May was delayed for several hours to avoid a line of thunderstorms passing over Lakehurst, but around 7:00 pm the airship was cleared for its final approach to the Naval Air Station, which it made at an altitude of 200 m (660 ft) with Captain Max Pruss in command. At 7:21 pm a pair of landing lines were dropped from the nose of the ship and were grabbed hold of by ground handlers. Four minutes later, at 7:25 pm Hindenburg burst into flames and dropped to the ground in a little over half a minute. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crew aboard, 13 passengers and 22 crew died, as well as one member of the ground crew, a total of 36 lives lost. Herbert Morrison's commentary of the incident became a classic of audio history. "", ""https://www.census.gov/history/www/homepage_archive/2022/may_2022.html\nOn May 6, 1937, the rigid German airship Hindenburg arrived at its Lakehurst, NJ, Naval Air Station destination after departing Frankfurt, Germany 3 days earlier. A crowded landing field of newspaper and radio journalists, film and still camera people, family, friends, and ground crew waited for the airship despite arriving hours behind schedule. As the Hindenburg prepared to dock with its mooring mast, it suddenly burst into flames forcing passengers and crew to jump from windows to escape the inferno. In seconds, the airship was completely destroyed and 36 people were dead. The disaster was immortalized as the first major aviation accident captured by photographs, sound recordings, and motion picture film. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH built the rigid passenger airship Hindenburg (LZ129) between 1931 and 1936 at its facility in Friedrichshafen, Germany. The first in its class of rigid airships, the Hindenburg remains the largest commercial airship ever built and flown, measuring nearly 804 feet long and 135 feet in diameter. Constructed using treated cotton canvas fabric stretched over an aluminum alloy frame, the 242 ton airship was held aloft by more than 7 million cubic feet of hydrogen gas. Four diesel-driven propeller engines drove the zeppelin to speeds of up to 84 miles per hour, while carrying 50 passengers, 60 or more crew members, and more than 21,000 pounds of cargo. Completed at the height of the Great Depression, passengers nevertheless eagerly paid approximately $450 for a one-way ticket—more than $8,750 in 2022 dollars—for the 2- to 3-day voyage between Frankfurt, Germany, and Lakehurst, NJ. Sleeping quarters were spartan, consisting of private cabins with cots or bunk beds and a shared bathroom, but the airship's other amenities rivaled the finest ocean liners.

33,571,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Torah_portion\n\x1b[92m[1] The parashah is a section of the Torah (Five Books of Moses) used in Jewish liturgy during a particular week\x1b[0m. There are 54 parshas, or parashiyot in Hebrew, and the full cycle is read over the course of one Biblical year. Content and number Each Torah portion consists of two to six chapters to be read during the week. There are 54 weekly portions or parashot. Torah reading mostly follows an annual cycle beginning and ending on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, with the divisions corresponding to the lunisolar Hebrew calendar, which contains up to 55 weeks, the exact number varying between leap years and regular years. There are some deviations to the cyclic regularity noted above, all related to the week of Passover and the week of Sukkot. For both holidays, the first day of the holiday may fall on a Sabbath, in which case the Torah reading consists of a special portion relevant to the holiday rather than a portion in the normal cyclical sequence. When either holiday does not begin on a Sabbath, yet a different 'out of cycle' portion is read on the Sabbath within the holiday week. Immediately following Sukkot is the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. In Israel, this holiday coincides with Simchat Torah; in the Jewish Diaspora, Simchat Torah is celebrated on the day following Shemini Atzeret. If Shemini Atzeret falls on a Sabbath, in the Diaspora a special 'out of cycle' Torah reading is inserted for that day. The final parashah, V'Zot HaBerachah, is always read on Simchat Torah. Apart from this 'immovable' final portion, there can be up to 53 weeks available for the other 53 portions. In years with fewer than 53 available weeks, some readings are combined so as to fit into the needed number of weekly readings. The annual completion of the Torah readings on Simchat Torah, translating to 'Rejoicing of the Torah', is marked by Jewish communities around the world. Name \x1b[92m[2] Each weekly Torah portion takes its name from the first distinctive word or two in the Hebrew text of the portion in question, often from the first verse\x1b[0m. Practice: who, when, what \x1b[92m[3] The appropriate parashah is chanted publicly\x1b[0m. In most communities, it is read by a designated reader (ba'al koreh) in Jewish prayer services, starting with a partial reading on the afternoon of Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. Saturday afternoon, again during the Monday and Thursday morning services, and ending with a full reading during the following Shabbat morning services (Saturday morning). The weekly reading is pre-empted by a special reading on major religious holidays. Each Saturday morning and holiday reading is followed by an often similarly themed reading (Haftarah) from the Book of Prophets (Nevi'im). Origin The custom dates to the time of the supposed Babylonian captivity (6th century BCE). The origin of the first public Torah readings is found in the Book of Nehemiah, where Ezra the scribe writes about wanting to find a way to ensure the Israelites would not go astray again. This led to the creation of a weekly system to read the portions of the Torah at synagogues. Alternative triennial cycle In ancient times some Jewish communities practiced a triennial cycle of readings.[citation needed] In the 19th and 20th centuries, many congregations in the Reform and Conservative Jewish movements implemented an alternative triennial cycle in which only one-third of each weekly parashah was read in a given year; and this pattern continues. The parashot read are still consistent with the annual cycle, but the entire Torah is completed over three years. Orthodox Judaism does not follow this practice. Differences between Israel and the diaspora Due to different lengths of holidays in Israel and the Diaspora, the portion that is read on a particular week will sometimes not be the same inside and outside Israel. Differences between communities While the Parshyot divisions are fairly standardized, there are various communities with differing parsha divisions. "", ""https://www.jewfaq.org/torah_readings\nportions are commonly doubled up so we can always read the entire Torah in the year. We read the last parshah right before a holiday called Simchat Torah (Rejoicing in the Law), which occurs in October, a few weeks after Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year). On Simchat Torah, we read the last few verses of Deuteronomy, and proceed immediately to the first paragraph of Genesis, showing that the Torah is a circle, and never ends. \x1b[95m[4] The weekly parshah is accompanied by a passage from the prophets, which is referred to as a haftarah\x1b[0m (הַפְטָרָה). Contrary to common misconception, 'haftarah' does not mean 'half-Torah.' The word comes from the Hebrew root Fei-Teit-Reish (פטר) and means 'Conclusion.' Usually, the haftarah portion is quite short and has some relation to the Torah portion of the week, though sometimes the portion is special for the date or time of year. Tradition teaches that haftarah portions began in a time when studying Torah was forbidden, so instead we read thematically related portions from the prophets to remind us of what the week's Torah portion would have been. The haftarah also shows us that the concepts discussed in the Torah portion were not limited to that one time but continued through Jewish history. A reading applies to the whole week. Children may review it on Sunday in Hebrew School. A small taste of the week's Torah reading is read during morning services on Monday and Thursday. But the big deal is on the last day of the week, Shabbat, when the Torah and haftarah readings are the centerpiece of the morning service. \x1b[95m[5] The Torah and haftarah readings are performed with great ceremony: the Torah scroll is paraded around the room with song, while members of the congregation touch the cover and kiss their fingers as it passes by, before it is brought to rest on the bimah (podium)\x1b[0m. On Shabbat, the reading is divided up into seven portions (appropriate for this holy 7th day), and various members of the congregation have the honor of reciting a blessing over a portion of the reading. This honor is referred to as an aliyah (עֲלִיָּה, literally, ascension). When two Torah portions are combined, as they commonly are, there are still seven aliyot, dividing the text up differently. There is also an eighth aliyah and portion called a maftir (מַפְטִיר, from the same פטר root as haftarah, meaning 'the one that concludes'), which usually repeats part of the seventh portion but is sometimes an additional piece for a holiday or time of year and usually puts a second or third Torah scroll in that initial procession. The first aliyah of any day's reading is reserved for a kohein, the second for a Levite, and priority for subsequent aliyot are given to people celebrating major life events, such as marriage or the birth of a child.

For both holidays, the first day of the holiday may fall on a Sabbath, in which case the Torah reading consists of a special portion relevant to the holiday rather than a portion in the normal cyclical sequence. When either holiday does not begin on a Sabbath, yet a different 'out of cycle' portion is read on the Sabbath within the holiday week. Immediately following Sukkot is the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. In Israel, this holiday coincides with Simchat Torah; in the Jewish Diaspora, Simchat Torah is celebrated on the day following Shemini Atzeret.

The weekly reading is pre-empted by a special reading on major religious holidays.

On Simchat Torah, we read the last few verses of Deuteronomy, and proceed immediately to the first paragraph of Genesis, showing that the Torah is a circle, and never ends. The weekly parshah is accompanied by a passage from the prophets, which is referred to as a haftarah (הַפְטָרָה). Contrary to common misconception, 'haftarah' does not mean 'half-Torah.'

Usually, the haftarah portion is quite short and has some relation to the Torah portion of the week, though sometimes the portion is special for the date or time of year. Tradition teaches that haftarah portions began in a time when studying Torah was forbidden, so instead we read thematically related portions from the prophets to remind us of what the week's Torah portion would have been.

Pangaea is from the Greek words pan, meaning 'entire,' and 'gaia,' meaning 'earth.' Alfred Wegener proposed the existence of Pangaea in the early 20th century based on evidence from geology, paleontology, and continental drift. Supercontinents like Gondwana and Laurasia combined with the Siberia landmass, resulting in Pangaea. A single large ocean called Panthalassa surrounded Pangaea. The formation of Pangaea had significant impacts on Earth's climate and biota: It created vast deserts in the center of the continent due to its distance from the ocean, while coastal areas experienced humid climates. The breakup of Pangaea began around 200 million years ago, leading to the formation of the separate continents currently on Earth. This process also caused massive volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which shaped Earth's current geological features. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodinia\n\x1b[92m[2] Rodinia (from the Russian родина, rodina, meaning 'motherland, birthplace') was a Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic supercontinent that assembled 1.26–0.90 billion years ago (Ga) and broke up 750–633 million years ago (Ma)\x1b[0m. Valentine & Moores 1970 were probably the first to recognise a Precambrian supercontinent, which they named 'Pangaea I.' It was renamed 'Rodinia' by McMenamin & McMenamin 1990 who also were the first to produce a reconstruction and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent. \x1b[92m[3] Rodinia formed at c. 1.23 Ga by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent, Columbia, assembled by global-scale 2.0–1.8 Ga collisional events\x1b[0m. Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic with its continental fragments reassembled to form Pannotia 633–573 Ma. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known about the configuration and geodynamic history of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the Earth's crust but not to their longitude, which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed. The extreme cooling of the global climate around 717–635 Ma (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes. Geodynamics Paleogeographic reconstructions Rodinia at 900 Ma. 'Consensus' reconstruction of Li et al. 2008. The idea that a supercontinent existed in the early Neoproterozoic arose in the 1970s, when geologists determined that orogens of this age exist on virtually all cratons.[failed verification] Examples are the Grenville orogeny in North America and the Dalslandian orogeny in Europe. Since then, many alternative reconstructions have been proposed for the configuration of the cratons in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different cratons. Though the configuration of the core cratons in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data.

"", ""According to J.D.A. Piper, Rodinia is one of two models for the configuration and history of the continental crust in the latter part of Precambrian times. The other is Paleopangea, Piper's own concept. Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the late Proterozoic and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent 'Paleopangaea' supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 Ma and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 Ma.

Valentine & Moores 1970 were probably the first to recognise a Precambrian supercontinent, which they named 'Pangaea I.' It was renamed 'Rodinia' by McMenamin & McMenamin 1990 who also were the first to produce a reconstruction and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent. \x1b[92m[3] Rodinia formed at c. 1.23 Ga by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent, Columbia, assembled by global-scale 2.0–1.8 Ga collisional events\x1b[0m. Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic with its continental fragments reassembled to form Pannotia 633–573 Ma. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known about the configuration and geodynamic history of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the Earth's crust but not to their longitude, which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed. The extreme cooling of the global climate around 717–635 Ma (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes. Geodynamics Paleogeographic reconstructions Rodinia at 900 Ma. 'Consensus' reconstruction of Li et al. 2008. The idea that a supercontinent existed in the early Neoproterozoic arose in the 1970s, when geologists determined that orogens of this age exist on virtually all cratons.[failed verification] Examples are the Grenville orogeny in North America and the Dalslandian orogeny in Europe. Since then, many alternative reconstructions have been proposed for the configuration of the cratons in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different cratons. Though the configuration of the core cratons in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data. Life timelineThis box: Most reconstructions show Rodinia's core formed by the North American Craton (the later paleocontinent of Laurentia), surrounded in the southeast with the East European Craton (the later paleocontinent of Baltica), the Amazonian Craton and the West African Craton; in the south with the Río de la Plata and São Francisco cratons; in the southwest with the Congo and Kalahari cratons; and in the northeast with Australia, India and eastern Antarctica. The positions of Siberia and North and South China north of the North American craton differ strongly depending on the reconstruction: SWEAT-Configuration (Southwest US-East Antarctica craton): Antarctica is southwest of Laurentia, and Australia is north of Antarctica. AUSWUS-Configuration (Australia-western US): Australia is west of Laurentia. AUSMEX-Configuration (Australia-Mexico): Australia is at the location of current day Mexico relative to Laurentia. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodinia\nAccording to J.D.A. Piper, Rodinia is one of two models for the configuration and history of the continental crust in the latter part of Precambrian times. The other is Paleopangea, Piper's own concept. Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the late Proterozoic and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent 'Paleopangaea' supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 Ma and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 Ma. This latter solution predicts that break-up was confined to the Ediacaran period and produced the dramatic environmental changes that characterised the transition between the Precambrian and Phanerozoic.

Yo-Yo Techniques ', ""There are several ways to rig live baits for fishing down to 50 fathoms. On a sportboat, the reversed dropper loop is best at these depths and the standard dropper loop rig works well in the shallower spots (20 fathoms or less) where there is less of a chance to hook rockfish. Personally, on a private boat, I use the 'Loreto Yellowtail' rig, which is basically a torpedo sinker tied to the main line and a six-foot leader attached to a snap swivel, which is attached to the bottom ring of the torpedo sinker. As this rig is lowered into the depths, a nose-hooked mackerel or sardine will swim freely behind the sinker until it is tracked down and inhaled by a big yellowtail. We use a snap swivel to the torpedo sinker to prevent line twist and this can be pre-rigged and left in the live bait tank until the boat marks fish. With the bait already pinned on the hook, you simply swing the bait from the tank and down into the depths (or the same timing as the jig fishermen). "", 'A quick and easy bottom rig to tie is the chicken rig.  The rig itself consists of multiple hooks with your lead on the bottom.  It presents your bait vertically in the water column, great for schooling fish suspended near the bottom.  We often use them to target vermillion snapper and yellow eye snapper off Miami.  My first introduction to chicken rigs was fishing for flounder off NJ.   Off NJ we would tie primarily double hook rigs, spaced closer together and with longer loops.  Chicken rigs work great for catching bait too, the Japanese sabiki rig is essential to anglers here in south Florida. Sabikis are essentially a miniature chicken rig. ', ""When angling pressure or a full moon keeps dolphin from feeding, try using their natural forage. That is, use a bait quill rig to acquire several of those banded rudderfish and other small specimens that cling tightly to weeds and debris. These comprise the dolphin’s natural forage and often produce when 'import' baits, such as pilchards and sardines, fall short. Drop these baits into a five-gallon bucket of seawater to keep them at the ready. Then impale one on a 2/0 or 3/0 live-bait-style hook that is rigged to a 20-pound-test fluorocarbon leader and a light, 8-pound-class spinning outfit. The light outfit pitches the bait a fair distance, and the light hardware lets it swim enticingly. Jigging for Dolphin Make sure you have good a range of color choices in your jigs.

When you happen on a weed line or an area where you’ve seen a dolphin or two and trolling isn’t cutting it, go on the chunk. Float out a few lines, each baited with a chunk of ballyhoo, sardine or squid. Add a few ounces of weight on one line with a rubber-core sinker or an egg sinker rigged with a rubber band in breakaway fashion (6 to 10 feet above the leader), followed by a balloon float some 30 to 40 feet up the fishing line (based on how deep you want the chunk to fish). Deploy two more outfits, one deeper and one free-lined at the surface. Cut up your extra ballyhoo or sardines, and toss over a few chunks until they fade from sight. Then repeat the tactic. If dolphin are in the area, sooner or later one of these baits will get eaten. And oftentimes, you’ll bring up a school of energized fish and set off a feeding blitz.

Off NJ we would tie primarily double hook rigs, spaced closer together and with longer loops.  Chicken rigs work great for catching bait too, the Japanese sabiki rig is essential to anglers here in south Florida. Sabikis are essentially a miniature chicken rig.

That is, use a bait quill rig to acquire several of those banded rudderfish and other small specimens that cling tightly to weeds and debris. These comprise the dolphin’s natural forage and often produce when 'import' baits, such as pilchards and sardines, fall short. Drop these baits into a five-gallon bucket of seawater to keep them at the ready. Then impale one on a 2/0 or 3/0 live-bait-style hook that is rigged to a 20-pound-test fluorocarbon leader and a light, 8-pound-class spinning outfit. The light outfit pitches the bait a fair distance, and the light hardware lets it swim enticingly. Jigging for Dolphin Make sure you have good a range of color choices in your jigs.

When you happen on a weed line or an area where you’ve seen a dolphin or two and trolling isn’t cutting it, go on the chunk. Float out a few lines, each baited with a chunk of ballyhoo, sardine or squid. Add a few ounces of weight on one line with a rubber-core sinker or an egg sinker rigged with a rubber band in breakaway fashion (6 to 10 feet above the leader), followed by a balloon float some 30 to 40 feet up the fishing line (based on how deep you want the chunk to fish). Deploy two more outfits, one deeper and one free-lined at the surface. Cut up your extra ballyhoo or sardines, and toss over a few chunks until they fade from sight. Then repeat the tactic. If dolphin are in the area, sooner or later one of these baits will get eaten. And oftentimes, you’ll bring up a school of energized fish and set off a feeding blitz.

Most Europeans of the time believed the institution of monarchy had been created by God, and kings and queens had been divinely appointed to rule.

In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, a New Deal policy which gave Native Americans more power to self-govern.  As William Canby Jr. writes, 'The Indian Reorganization was based on the assumption, quite contrary to that of the Allotment Act, that the tribes not only would be in existence for an indefinite period, but that they should be.' William C. Canby, Jr., American Indian Law in a Nutshell 25 (6th ed., 2015). The Indian Reorganization Act effectively ended the previous era's policy of allotting land.  Additionally, surplus lands on reservations were returned to tribal ownership if they were not previously acquired by another entity.  This new policy of recognizing Native Americans and the land promised to them dramatically increased the ability of tribes to enhance their sovereignty. "", ""From these experiences came a uniquely American view of power and liberty as natural enemies. The nation’s founders believed that containing the government’s power and protecting liberty was their most important task, and declared a new purpose for government: the protection of individual rights. The protection of rights was not the government’s only purpose. It was still expected to protect the community against foreign and domestic threats, to ensure economic growth, and to conduct foreign affairs. It was not, however, the government’s job to tell people how to live their lives, what religion to believe in, or what to write about in a pamphlet or newspaper. In this sense, the idea of individual rights is the oldest and most traditional of American values. 'Certain Unalienable Rights' Democracy and liberty are often thought to be the same thing, but they are not. Democracy means that people ought to be able to vote for public officials in fair elections, and make most political decisions by majority rule.Liberty, on the other hand, means that even in a democracy, individuals have rights that no majority should be able to take away. The rights that the Constitution’s framers wanted to protect from government abuse were referred to in the Declaration of Independence as 'unalienable rights.' They were also called 'natural' rights, and to James Madison, they were 'the great rights of mankind.' Although it is commonly thought that we are entitled to free speech because the First Amendment gives it to us, this country’s original citizens believed that as human beings, they were entitled to free speech, and they invented the First Amendment in order to protect it. The entire Bill of Rights was created to protect rights the original citizens believed were naturally theirs, including: Freedom of Religion "", ""Constitution of the United States—A History A More Perfect Union: The Creation of the U.S. Constitution Enlarge General George Washington He was unanimously elected president of the Philadelphia convention.

Most Europeans of the time believed the institution of monarchy had been created by God, and kings and queens had been divinely appointed to rule. Locke, however, theorized that human beings, not God, had created government. People sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government’s protection of their lives, liberty, and property. Locke called this implicit agreement between a people and their government the social contract. Should government deprive people of their rights by abusing the power given to it, the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms. The people could thus withdraw their consent to obey and form another government for their protection. \x1b[92m[1] The desire to limit the power of government is closely related to the belief that people should govern themselves\x1b[0m. This core tenet of American political thought was rooted in a variety of traditions. First, the British government did allow for a degree of self-government. Laws were made by Parliament, and property-owning males were allowed to vote for representatives to Parliament. Thus, Americans were accustomed to the idea of representative government from the beginning. \x1b[92m[2] For instance, Virginia established its House of Burgesses in 1619\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] Upon their arrival in North America a year later, the English Separatists who settled the Plymouth Colony, commonly known as the Pilgrims, promptly authored the Mayflower Compact, an agreement to govern themselves according to the laws created by the male voters of the colony\x1b[0m.[1] ', ""https://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/indigenous/selfgovernment\nThe Self-Government Era, was an era in which federal policies toward Native Americans began to change.  In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, a New Deal policy which gave Native Americans more power to self-govern.  As William Canby Jr. writes, 'The Indian Reorganization was based on the assumption, quite contrary to that of the Allotment Act, that the tribes not only would be in existence for an indefinite period, but that they should be.' William C. Canby, Jr., American Indian Law in a Nutshell 25 (6th ed., 2015). The Indian Reorganization Act effectively ended the previous era's policy of allotting land.  Additionally, surplus lands on reservations were returned to tribal ownership if they were not previously acquired by another entity.  This new policy of recognizing Native Americans and the land promised to them dramatically increased the ability of tribes to enhance their sovereignty. "", ""https://www.aclu.org/documents/bill-rights-brief-history\nFrom these experiences came a uniquely American view of power and liberty as natural enemies. The nation’s founders believed that containing the government’s power and protecting liberty was their most important task, and declared a new purpose for government: the protection of individual rights. The protection of rights was not the government’s only purpose. It was still expected to protect the community against foreign and domestic threats, to ensure economic growth, and to conduct foreign affairs. It was not, however, the government’s job to tell people how to live their lives, what religion to believe in, or what to write about in a pamphlet or newspaper. In this sense, the idea of individual rights is the oldest and most traditional of American values. 'Certain Unalienable Rights' Democracy and liberty are often thought to be the same thing, but they are not. Democracy means that people ought to be able to vote for public officials in fair elections, and make most political decisions by majority rule.Liberty, on the other hand, means that even in a democracy, individuals have rights that no majority should be able to take away. The rights that the Constitution’s framers wanted to protect from government abuse were referred to in the Declaration of Independence as 'unalienable rights.' They were also called 'natural' rights, and to James Madison, they were 'the great rights of mankind.' Although it is commonly thought that we are entitled to free speech because the First Amendment gives it to us, this country’s original citizens believed that as human beings, they were entitled to free speech, and they invented the First Amendment in order to protect it. The entire Bill of Rights was created to protect rights the original citizens believed were naturally theirs, including: Freedom of Religion "", ""https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/more-perfect-union\nConstitution of the United States—A History A More Perfect Union: The Creation of the U.S. Constitution Enlarge General George Washington He was unanimously elected president of the Philadelphia convention.

The skin of nectarines lacks the fuzz (fruit-skin trichomes) that peach skin has; a mutation in a single gene (MYB25) is thought to be responsible for the difference between the two. In 2018, China produced 62% of the world total of peaches and nectarines. Spain, Italy, Turkey and Greece, all situated in the Mediterranean region, are prominent producers of peaches. Description Peach flowers Cultivated peaches are divided into clingstones and freestones, depending on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not; both can have either white or yellow flesh. Peaches with white flesh typically are very sweet with little acidity, while yellow-fleshed peaches typically have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness, though this also varies greatly. Both colors often have some red on their skins. Low-acid, white-fleshed peaches are the most popular kinds in China, Japan, and neighbouring Asian countries, while Europeans and North Americans have historically favoured the acidic, yellow-fleshed cultivars. Peach trees are relatively short-lived as compared with some other fruit trees. In some regions orchards are replanted after 8 to 10 years, while in others trees may produce satisfactorily for 20 to 25 years or more, depending upon their resistance to diseases, pests, and winter damage. Etymology ', ""An article on peach tree cultivation in Spain is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture. The peach was brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, and eventually made it to England and France in the 17th century, where it was a prized and expensive treat. Horticulturist George Minifie supposedly brought the first peaches from England to its North American colonies in the early 17th century, planting them at his estate of Buckland in Virginia. Although Thomas Jefferson had peach trees at Monticello, American farmers did not begin commercial production until the 19th century in Maryland, Delaware, Georgia, South Carolina, and finally Virginia. "", ""In the United States the peach was soon adopted as a crop by American Indians. The peach also became naturalized and abundant as a wild species in the eastern U.S.. Peaches were being grown in Virginia as early as 1629. Peaches grown by Indians in Virginia were said to have been 'of greater variety and finer sorts' than those of the English colonists. Also in 1629, peaches were listed as a crop in New Mexico. William Penn noted the existence of wild peaches in Pennsylvania in 1683. "", 'Peaches grow in a fairly limited range in dry, continental or temperate climates, since the trees have a chilling requirement that tropical or subtropical areas generally do not satisfy except at high altitudes (for example in certain areas of Ecuador, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, and Nepal). Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around 0 to 10 °C (32 to 50 °F). During the chilling period, key chemical reactions occur, but the plant appears dormant. Once the chilling period is fulfilled, the plant enters a second type of dormancy, the quiescence period. During quiescence, buds break and grow when sufficient warm weather favorable to growth is accumulated. ', ""Most peach trees sold by nurseries are cultivars budded or grafted onto a suitable rootstock. Common rootstocks are 'Lovell Peach', 'Nemaguard Peach', Prunus besseyi, and 'Citation'. The rootstock provides hardiness and budding is done to improve predictability of the fruit quality. Peach trees need full sun, and a layout that allows good natural air flow to assist the thermal environment for the tree. Peaches are planted in early winter. During the growth season, they need a regular and reliable supply of water, with higher amounts just before harvest. Peaches need nitrogen-rich fertilizers more than other fruit trees. Without regular fertilizer supply, peach tree leaves start turning yellow or exhibit stunted growth. Blood meal, bone meal, and calcium ammonium nitrate are suitable fertilizers.

When Georgia reached peak production in the 1920s, elaborate festivals celebrated the fruit. By 2017, Georgia's production represented 3–5% of the U.S. total. Alabama named it the 'state tree fruit' in 2006. Delaware's state flower has been the peach blossom since 1995, and peach pie became its official dessert in 2009.

The skin of nectarines lacks the fuzz (fruit-skin trichomes) that peach skin has; a mutation in a single gene (MYB25) is thought to be responsible for the difference between the two. In 2018, China produced 62% of the world total of peaches and nectarines. Spain, Italy, Turkey and Greece, all situated in the Mediterranean region, are prominent producers of peaches. Description Peach flowers Cultivated peaches are divided into clingstones and freestones, depending on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not; both can have either white or yellow flesh. Peaches with white flesh typically are very sweet with little acidity, while yellow-fleshed peaches typically have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness, though this also varies greatly. Both colors often have some red on their skins. Low-acid, white-fleshed peaches are the most popular kinds in China, Japan, and neighbouring Asian countries, while Europeans and North Americans have historically favoured the acidic, yellow-fleshed cultivars. Peach trees are relatively short-lived as compared with some other fruit trees. In some regions orchards are replanted after 8 to 10 years, while in others trees may produce satisfactorily for 20 to 25 years or more, depending upon their resistance to diseases, pests, and winter damage. Etymology ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach\nAn article on peach tree cultivation in Spain is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture. The peach was brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, and eventually made it to England and France in the 17th century, where it was a prized and expensive treat. Horticulturist George Minifie supposedly brought the first peaches from England to its North American colonies in the early 17th century, planting them at his estate of Buckland in Virginia. Although Thomas Jefferson had peach trees at Monticello, American farmers did not begin commercial production until the 19th century in Maryland, Delaware, Georgia, South Carolina, and finally Virginia. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach\nIn the United States the peach was soon adopted as a crop by American Indians. The peach also became naturalized and abundant as a wild species in the eastern U.S.. Peaches were being grown in Virginia as early as 1629. Peaches grown by Indians in Virginia were said to have been 'of greater variety and finer sorts' than those of the English colonists. Also in 1629, peaches were listed as a crop in New Mexico. William Penn noted the existence of wild peaches in Pennsylvania in 1683. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach\nPeaches grow in a fairly limited range in dry, continental or temperate climates, since the trees have a chilling requirement that tropical or subtropical areas generally do not satisfy except at high altitudes (for example in certain areas of Ecuador, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, and Nepal). Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around 0 to 10 °C (32 to 50 °F). During the chilling period, key chemical reactions occur, but the plant appears dormant. Once the chilling period is fulfilled, the plant enters a second type of dormancy, the quiescence period. During quiescence, buds break and grow when sufficient warm weather favorable to growth is accumulated. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach\nMost peach trees sold by nurseries are cultivars budded or grafted onto a suitable rootstock. Common rootstocks are 'Lovell Peach', 'Nemaguard Peach', Prunus besseyi, and 'Citation'. The rootstock provides hardiness and budding is done to improve predictability of the fruit quality. Peach trees need full sun, and a layout that allows good natural air flow to assist the thermal environment for the tree. Peaches are planted in early winter. During the growth season, they need a regular and reliable supply of water, with higher amounts just before harvest. Peaches need nitrogen-rich fertilizers more than other fruit trees. Without regular fertilizer supply, peach tree leaves start turning yellow or exhibit stunted growth. Blood meal, bone meal, and calcium ammonium nitrate are suitable fertilizers. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach\nIn 2020, world production of peaches (combined with nectarines for reporting) was 24.6 million tonnes, led by China with 61% of the world total (table). \x1b[1;35;40m[2] The U.S. state of Georgia is known as the 'Peach State' due to its significant production of peaches as early as 1571, with exports to other states occurring around 1858\x1b[0m. In 2014, Georgia was third in US peach production behind California and South Carolina. The largest peach producing countries in Latin America are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. Cultural significance Peaches are not only a popular fruit, but also are symbolic in many cultural traditions, such as in art, paintings, and folk tales such as the Peaches of Immortality. China See also: Peaches of Immortality "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach\nIn literature, Roald Dahl named his children's fantasy novel James and the Giant Peach because a peach is 'prettier, bigger and squishier than a cherry.'

At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of longitude converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value.

The nearest permanently inhabited place is Alert on Ellesmere Island, Canada, which is located 817 km (508 mi) from the Pole. While the South Pole lies on a continental land mass, the North Pole is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice. The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at 4,261 m (13,980 ft) by the Russian Mir submersible in 2007 and at 4,087 m (13,409 ft) by USS Nautilus in 1958. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole (unlike the South Pole). However, the Soviet Union, and later Russia, constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, a group of Russians have also annually established a private base, Barneo, close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring.

In summer (November through February), the sun is continuously above the horizon and appears to move in a counter-clockwise circle. However, it is always low in the sky, reaching a maximum of approximately 23.5° around the December solstice because of the approximately 23.5° tilt of the earth's axis. Much of the sunlight that does reach the surface is reflected by the white snow. This lack of warmth from the sun, combined with the high altitude (about 2,800 metres (9,200 ft)), means that the South Pole has one of the coldest climates on Earth (though it is not quite the coldest; that record goes to the region in the vicinity of the Vostok Station, also in Antarctica, which lies at a higher elevation). In most places on Earth, local time is determined by longitude, such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the perceived position of the Sun in the sky (for example, at midday the Sun is roughly perceived to be at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the South Pole, where the Sun is seen to rise and set only once per year with solar elevation varying only with day of the year, not time of day. There is no a priori reason for placing the South Pole in any particular time zone, but as a matter of practical convenience the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station keeps New Zealand Time (UTC+12/UTC+13). This is because the US flies its resupply missions ('Operation Deep Freeze') out of McMurdo Station, which is supplied from Christchurch, New Zealand.

The major nations all recognized that the Confederacy had certain rights as an organized belligerent. A few nations did take advantage of the war. Spain recaptured its lost colony of the Dominican Republic, although it was lost in 1865. More serious was the war by France, under Emperor Napoleon III, to install Maximilian I of Mexico as a puppet ruler which aimed to negate American influence. France therefore encouraged Britain to join in a policy of mediation, suggesting that both recognize the Confederacy. Lincoln repeatedly warned that any recognition of the Confederacy was tantamount to a declaration of war. The British textile industry depended on cotton from the South, but it had stocks to keep the mills operating for a year and in any case, the industrialists and workers carried little weight in British politics. Knowing a war would cut off vital shipments of American food, wreak havoc on the British merchant fleet, and cause an invasion of Canada, Britain and its powerful Royal Navy refused to join France. Historians emphasize that Union diplomacy proved generally effective, with expert diplomats handling numerous crises. British leaders had some sympathy for the Confederacy, but were never willing to risk war with the Union. France was even more sympathetic to the Confederacy, but it was threatened by Prussia and would not make a move without full British cooperation. Confederate diplomats were inept, or as one historian put it, 'Poorly chosen diplomats produce poor diplomacy.' Other countries played a minor role. Russia made a show of support of the Union, but its importance has often been exaggerated. United States "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_of_the_American_Civil_War\nThe U.S. looked the other way when Irish activists known as Fenians tried and failed badly in an invasion of Canada in 1871. The arbitration of the Alabama Claims in 1872 provided a satisfactory reconciliation; the British paid the United States $15.5 million for the economic damage caused by Confederate warships purchased from it. Congress purchased Alaska from Russia in the Alaska Purchase in 1867, but otherwise rejected proposals for any major expansions, such as the proposal by President Ulysses Grant to acquire Santo Domingo.

The Confederacy confidently expected England to escort Confederate cotton vessels or to send British merchant and war ships to Southern ports to pick up vitally needed cotton. To hasten this active intervention, the Confederacy informally cut off most cotton exports in 1861. Surprisingly, England took no official action to break the blockade and even tolerated the seizure by the Union of British ships trading with the Confederacy. Nor did England ever officially extend diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.

FTP is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a plain-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The first FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems. Many dedicated FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been incorporated into productivity applications such as HTML editors and file managers. An FTP client used to be commonly integrated in web browsers, where file servers are browsed with the URI prefix 'ftp://'.

Anonymous FTP "", ""For a long time, most common web browsers were able to retrieve files hosted on FTP servers, although not all of them had support for protocol extensions such as FTPS. When an FTP—rather than an HTTP—URL is supplied, the accessible contents on the remote server are presented in a manner that is similar to that used for other web content. Google Chrome removed FTP support entirely in Chrome 88, also affecting other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge. Firefox 88 disabled FTP support by default, with Firefox 90 dropping support entirely. FireFTP is a discontinued browser extension that was designed as a full-featured FTP client to be run within Firefox, but when Firefox dropped support for FTP the extension developer recommended using Waterfox. Some browsers, such as the text-based Lynx, still support FTP. Syntax FTP URL syntax is described in RFC 1738, taking the form: ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/[url-path] (the bracketed parts are optional). For example, the URL ftp://public.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt represents the file myfile.txt from the directory mydirectory on the server public.ftp-servers.example.com as an FTP resource. The URL ftp://user001:secretpassword@private.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt adds a specification of the username and password that must be used to access this resource. More details on specifying a username and password may be found in the browsers' documentation (e.g., Firefox and Internet Explorer). By default, most web browsers use passive (PASV) mode, which more easily traverses end-user firewalls. Some variation has existed in how different browsers treat path resolution in cases where there is a non-root home directory for a user.

If the server supports it, users may log in without providing login credentials, but the same server may authorize only limited access for such sessions. Anonymous FTP "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol\nFor a long time, most common web browsers were able to retrieve files hosted on FTP servers, although not all of them had support for protocol extensions such as FTPS. When an FTP—rather than an HTTP—URL is supplied, the accessible contents on the remote server are presented in a manner that is similar to that used for other web content. Google Chrome removed FTP support entirely in Chrome 88, also affecting other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge. Firefox 88 disabled FTP support by default, with Firefox 90 dropping support entirely. FireFTP is a discontinued browser extension that was designed as a full-featured FTP client to be run within Firefox, but when Firefox dropped support for FTP the extension developer recommended using Waterfox. Some browsers, such as the text-based Lynx, still support FTP. Syntax FTP URL syntax is described in RFC 1738, taking the form: ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/[url-path] (the bracketed parts are optional). For example, the URL ftp://public.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt represents the file myfile.txt from the directory mydirectory on the server public.ftp-servers.example.com as an FTP resource. The URL ftp://user001:secretpassword@private.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt adds a specification of the username and password that must be used to access this resource. More details on specifying a username and password may be found in the browsers' documentation (e.g., Firefox and Internet Explorer). By default, most web browsers use passive (PASV) mode, which more easily traverses end-user firewalls. Some variation has existed in how different browsers treat path resolution in cases where there is a non-root home directory for a user.

Foote also oversaw the conversion of on-campus student housing into residential colleges and the university launch of its largest fundraising campaign to date, a five-year, $400 million campaign that began in 1984 and exceeded that goal, raising $517.5 million. Foote established three new schools: the School of Architecture, the School of Communication, and the School of International Studies. During Foote's tenure, the university's endowment increased nearly ten-fold, growing from $47.4 million in 1981 to $465.2 million in 2000.

The one dj they didn’t hire after klos was Jim Ladd, he would have fit in well and was the best dj there. Before Klos and Kmet there was KPPC and KNAC(before their metal format), they kicked ass on anything after them. The closest to that today is KOCI 101.5 in Costa Mesa, awesome station to listen to and stream, great music and you won’t hear the same song in 2 months if that and their limited commercials are low key.

The station would be commercial-free until that 10,000th song played. At that point, they would open the phones and give $10,000 to the 92nd caller. Nobody was sure exactly how long it would take to play those 10,000 songs.

Bill LaTour eventually replaced Chris Shebel on air when Chris focused exclusively on his role as program director. And last, but not least, Melissa Forman made her Chicago radio debut as George’s morning co-host about 5 months into the format.*** "", 'I think I can honestly say one of the reasons why Kiss stood apart from the rest – I know because I took it on myself to recruit the DJs – we were truly multi-cultural. We had black DJs, we had white DJs, we had Asian DJs. At that time no one else dared do anything like that. We gave a platform to young black kids, young Asian kids, young disadvantaged kids. Normally, the radio stations that went before were the privilege of rich kids, middle-class college kids, who had the money and the wherewithal to set it up. We were urban, we were real.

'WELL YE’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GO AGIN IF YOU HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD!' I think this was the bit where he expected us to break down, our hopes and dreams of making a new life in Americay dashed by our heinous and unlawful transmitter hiding/mountain walking. It didn’t work. They let us go and later, after we’d given the right people the coordinates of the transmitter, Kiss FM was back on air. Damien McCaul and Steven Cooper cried tears of joy as their fledgling careers were saved. For our reward we were given a 100% pay rise by the station owners and maybe, just maybe, we got bought a cod and chips from the Borza’s on Whitehall Road. It was the last time Daragh and I ever went mountain walking together. Once was quite enough.

In completing its merger with CBS Radio, the American broadcasting company Entercom has agreed to sell three of its radio stations, among which is 100.3 The Sound. The classic rock station is to be replaced by the Christian Contemporary station, K-LOVE and, according to Program Director, Dave Beasing, The Sound now has 30 days until their operations are shuttered. Now radio stations may come and go, but to learn this one is heading towards the annals of radio history has left me utterly infuriated and deeply depressed. Like many out there, I found The Sound and am not prepared to lose it. ', 'https://theultimaterabbit.com/2017/10/02/goodbye-100-3-fm-the-sound-dammit/\nI listened to the Sound from the beginning before they had any dj’s hoping they could become a great radio station, unfortunately they turned into a KLOS clone without the Mike Diamond commercials. The one dj they didn’t hire after klos was Jim Ladd, he would have fit in well and was the best dj there. Before Klos and Kmet there was KPPC and KNAC(before their metal format), they kicked ass on anything after them. The closest to that today is KOCI 101.5 in Costa Mesa, awesome station to listen to and stream, great music and you won’t hear the same song in 2 months if that and their limited commercials are low key.

The station would be commercial-free until that 10,000th song played. At that point, they would open the phones and give $10,000 to the 92nd caller. Nobody was sure exactly how long it would take to play those 10,000 songs. So, the brand new airstaff was hired and brought to town a few days early: George McFly (mornings) Harry Legg (middays) Chris Shebel (early afternoons) Shark (late afternoons) Jeffrey T. Mason (evenings) ***George wasn’t here for the launch, but would arrive soon after. We brought Luis '2-Live' Lopez on for overnights a month or so later. Bill LaTour eventually replaced Chris Shebel on air when Chris focused exclusively on his role as program director. And last, but not least, Melissa Forman made her Chicago radio debut as George’s morning co-host about 5 months into the format.*** "", 'https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/norman-jay-public-mbe-no-1/\nI think I can honestly say one of the reasons why Kiss stood apart from the rest – I know because I took it on myself to recruit the DJs – we were truly multi-cultural. We had black DJs, we had white DJs, we had Asian DJs. At that time no one else dared do anything like that. We gave a platform to young black kids, young Asian kids, young disadvantaged kids. Normally, the radio stations that went before were the privilege of rich kids, middle-class college kids, who had the money and the wherewithal to set it up. We were urban, we were real. We had rich kids from Hampstead doing shows next to kids from estates in Peckham. The one thing we had in common was the music.

Myers patented a corn-popping device that added a stay-cool handle. But popcorn’s real rise wouldn’t come until sellers could easily carry popping machines around with them. That happened in Chicago in 1885, when Charles Cretors invented a lightweight electric machine that popped corn in oil, allowing vendors to easily move along with crowds in search of a better profit.

The coating separated the kernels so they could be boxed or packaged without getting soggy or dusty. Around then, two brothers began to experiment with new ways to flavor popcorn. Originally from Germany, Frederick and Lewis Rueckheim sold small batches of popcorn they made with a handheld popper. In 1896, they developed a combination that stuck: Cracker Jack, a combination of crunchy popcorn and salty peanuts coated in molasses. The 20th century brought more popcorn patents, each aiming to improve the product or refine the tools of the trade.

Without the scientific foundation provided by these pioneers, Watson and Crick may never have reached their groundbreaking conclusion of 1953: that the DNA molecule exists in the form of a three-dimensional double helix. The First Piece of the Puzzle: Miescher Discovers DNA Although few people realize it, 1869 was a landmark year in genetic research, because it was the year in which Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher first identified what he called 'nuclein' inside the nuclei of human white blood cells. (The term 'nuclein' was later changed to 'nucleic acid' and eventually to 'deoxyribonucleic acid,' or 'DNA.') Miescher's plan was to isolate and characterize not the nuclein (which nobody at that time realized existed) but instead the protein components of leukocytes (white blood cells). Miescher thus made arrangements for a local surgical clinic to send him used, pus-coated patient bandages; once he received the bandages, he planned to wash them, filter out the leukocytes, and extract and identify the various proteins within the white blood cells. But when he came across a substance from the cell nuclei that had chemical properties unlike any protein, including a much higher phosphorous content and resistance to proteolysis (protein digestion), Miescher realized that he had discovered a new substance (Dahm, 2008). Sensing the importance of his findings, Miescher wrote, 'It seems probable to me that a whole family of such slightly varying phosphorous-containing substances will appear, as a group of nucleins, equivalent to proteins' (Wolf, 2003). More than 50 years passed before the significance of Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids was widely appreciated by the scientific community. For instance, in a 1971 essay on the history of nucleic acid research, Erwin Chargaff noted that in a 1961 historical account of nineteenth-century science, Charles Darwin was mentioned 31 times, Thomas Huxley 14 times, but Miescher not even once. This omission is all the more remarkable given that, as Chargaff also noted, Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids was unique among the discoveries of the four major cellular components (i.e., proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids) in that it could be 'dated precisely...

When I listened to this gospel-pop classic for the first time in absolute yonks, I was dragged off on a wave of nostalgia. I struggled to make any notes.

BeBe Winans (their 1st and only #1s) 1 week, from 25th May – 1st June 1997 ', 'Eternal were probably the biggest British girl group in the first half of the 1990s. The only British girl group of the time, really, until the Spice Girls came along and opened the floodgates for the final years of the decade. They were a sort of British answer to En Vogue, two sisters and two others. Louise Nurding had left in 1995 to start a middling solo career, and to become one of the original WAGs by marrying Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp. This was their 11th Top 10 hit since 1993, and they would only have one more before splitting in 1999. Fair to say, although they had some good pop singles, they peaked with this – a fitting record to become their only chart-topper. ‘I Wanna Be the Only One’ was the 2nd most played song on British radio for the year, meaning that plenty of people surely got sick of it. One of my key memories of the record is hearing it in a car park while eating an ice-cream, presumably sometime in May or June 1997, just at the moment I was getting interested in the charts (I believe that this was Track 1 on ‘Now 37’). Soon after that I would start faithfully writing the Top 40 down every week, trying to keep up with the live radio countdown in those pre-internet days. It’s not an exaggeration to say that if it hadn’t been for songs like this grabbing my attention at that formative age, I might not be writing this blog now.

Eternal bounced mildly around the Top 5 for a few years, making records I remember a great deal less well or fondly than 'My Lovin’' or 'Free Your Mind'. When Louise Nurding left the group to strike out solo, she did exactly the same. So 'I Wanna Be The Only One' at Number One felt like a reward for patient service, in line with the BRIT Awards Nominations Eternal kept racking up. But for once the public get a group right: this is Eternal’s most likeable moment, with collaboration bringing out the best in them. I can’t bluff and pretend I know anything about the history of gospel in the 80s and 90s, but clearly the Winans family are a major force in it, and BeBe Winans came to this record with a dozen years’ experience duetting with his sister – mixing it up with female voices is his speciality, and his interplay with the group here is terrific. 'I Wanna Be The Only One' is purring along before he gets there – the first verse setting up the shape of the song, with a solo voice cradled by those soft 'yeah yeah yeah yeah' backing pulses. But Winans wakes everyone up, sidling into the song like a televangelist – 'Now you deserve a mansion / You can have the best in life' – and as soon as he arrives Eternal relax and start to enjoy themselves. Winans’ presence makes the song a nonsense as a narrative – who’s meant to be soothing who anymore? Where’s this pain that’s being erased? (BeBe Winans certainly doesn’t have an ounce of it). But that’s fine – his swaggering entrance is just a signal to appreciate the song as pure collaboration, to enjoy the heaped key changes, the vamps, the ecstatic group pile-on at the end.

When I listened to this gospel-pop classic for the first time in absolute yonks, I was dragged off on a wave of nostalgia. I struggled to make any notes. It was the biggest Proustian rush I’ve experienced yet, as we delve further into the chart-toppers of my childhood. I Wanna Be the Only One, by Eternal ft. BeBe Winans (their 1st and only #1s) 1 week, from 25th May – 1st June 1997 ', 'https://number1sblog.com/2024/05/19/768-i-wanna-be-the-only-one-eternal-ft-bebe-winans/\nEternal were probably the biggest British girl group in the first half of the 1990s. The only British girl group of the time, really, until the Spice Girls came along and opened the floodgates for the final years of the decade. They were a sort of British answer to En Vogue, two sisters and two others. Louise Nurding had left in 1995 to start a middling solo career, and to become one of the original WAGs by marrying Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp. This was their 11th Top 10 hit since 1993, and they would only have one more before splitting in 1999. Fair to say, although they had some good pop singles, they peaked with this – a fitting record to become their only chart-topper. ‘I Wanna Be the Only One’ was the 2nd most played song on British radio for the year, meaning that plenty of people surely got sick of it. One of my key memories of the record is hearing it in a car park while eating an ice-cream, presumably sometime in May or June 1997, just at the moment I was getting interested in the charts (I believe that this was Track 1 on ‘Now 37’). Soon after that I would start faithfully writing the Top 40 down every week, trying to keep up with the live radio countdown in those pre-internet days. It’s not an exaggeration to say that if it hadn’t been for songs like this grabbing my attention at that formative age, I might not be writing this blog now.

Eternal bounced mildly around the Top 5 for a few years, making records I remember a great deal less well or fondly than 'My Lovin’' or 'Free Your Mind'. When Louise Nurding left the group to strike out solo, she did exactly the same. So 'I Wanna Be The Only One' at Number One felt like a reward for patient service, in line with the BRIT Awards Nominations Eternal kept racking up. But for once the public get a group right: this is Eternal’s most likeable moment, with collaboration bringing out the best in them. I can’t bluff and pretend I know anything about the history of gospel in the 80s and 90s, but clearly the Winans family are a major force in it, and BeBe Winans came to this record with a dozen years’ experience duetting with his sister – mixing it up with female voices is his speciality, and his interplay with the group here is terrific. 'I Wanna Be The Only One' is purring along before he gets there – the first verse setting up the shape of the song, with a solo voice cradled by those soft 'yeah yeah yeah yeah' backing pulses. But Winans wakes everyone up, sidling into the song like a televangelist – 'Now you deserve a mansion / You can have the best in life' – and as soon as he arrives Eternal relax and start to enjoy themselves. Winans’ presence makes the song a nonsense as a narrative – who’s meant to be soothing who anymore? Where’s this pain that’s being erased? (BeBe Winans certainly doesn’t have an ounce of it). But that’s fine – his swaggering entrance is just a signal to appreciate the song as pure collaboration, to enjoy the heaped key changes, the vamps, the ecstatic group pile-on at the end.

Since these resources are limited and conditions in the finance world constantly change, effective financial management is what guides businesses and individuals toward success. In this blog, let’s take a look at the various objectives of financial management, and understand why achieving these financial management goals is vital for any business or individual to thrive. Goals of Financial Management At its core, the primary objective of financial management is to optimise financial resources for the betterment of an individual or an organisation, emphasizing effective financial planning. To achieve this large goal, one has to break it down into smaller goals so it can be made more attainable and easier to manage. Let’s explore the goals of financial management in detail. 1. Profit Maximization ', ""What Is Strategic Financial Management? Strategic financial management means not only managing a company's finances but managing them with the intention to succeed—that is, to attain the company's long-term goals and objectives and maximize shareholder value over time. Key Takeaways Strategic financial management is about creating profits for the business over the long run.It seeks to maximize return on investment for stakeholders.This differs from tactical management, which looks to seize near-term opportunities.A financial plan is strategic and focuses on long-term gain. Strategic financial planning varies by company, industry, and sector. Understanding Strategic Financial Management Strategic financial management is about creating profit for the business and ensuring an acceptable return on investment (ROI). Financial management is accomplished through business financial plans, setting up financial controls, and financial decision-making. Before a company can manage itself strategically, it first needs to define its objectives precisely, identify and quantify its available and potential resources, and devise a specific plan to use its finances and other capital resources toward achieving its goals. Strategic management also involves understanding and properly controlling, allocating, and obtaining a company's assets and liabilities, including monitoring operational financing items like expenditures, revenues, accounts receivable and payable, cash flow, and profitability. Strategic financial management encompasses furthermore involves continuous evaluating, planning, and adjusting to keep the company focused and on track toward long-term goals. When a company is managing strategically, it deals with short-term issues on an ad hoc basis in ways that do not derail its long-term vision. Strategic financial management includes assessing and managing a company's capital structure, the mix of debt and equity finance employed, to ensure a company's long-term solvency. Strategic Versus Tactical Financial Management The term 'strategic' refers to financial management practices that are focused on long-term success, as opposed to 'tactical' management decisions, which relate to short-term positioning. If a company is being strategic instead of tactical, it makes financial decisions based on what it thinks would achieve results ultimately—that is, in the future—which implies that to realize those results, a firm sometimes must tolerate losses in the present. 'Strategic' management focuses on long-term success and 'tactical' management relates to short-term positioning.

Here a firm needs to be creative, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to strategic management, and each company will devise elements that reflect its own particular needs and goals. However, some of the more common elements of strategic financial management could include the following.

', ""The scientific method is the process by which science is carried out. As in other areas of inquiry, science (through the scientific method) can build on previous knowledge, and can unify understanding of its topics of study over time.[g] This model can be seen to underlie the scientific revolution. The overall process involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct. However, there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, these actions are better considered as general principles. Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always done in the same order. As noted by scientist and philosopher William Whewell (1794–1866), 'invention, sagacity, [and] genius' are required at every step. "", ""The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, imagination, and creativity. In this sense, it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow but is rather an ongoing cycle, constantly developing more useful, accurate, and comprehensive models and methods. For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's Principia. On the contrary, if the astronomically massive, the feather-light, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories – all phenomena Newton could not have observed – Newton's equations are what remain. Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase confidence in Newton's work. An iterative, pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding: Define a question Gather information and resources (observe) Form an explanatory hypothesis "", ""Hypothesis development Main article: Hypothesis formation Linus Pauling proposed that DNA might be a triple helix. This hypothesis was also considered by Francis Crick and James D. Watson but discarded. When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data that Pauling was wrong. and that Pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon, or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena. Normally, hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model. Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as existential statements, stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of universal statements, stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic. Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have – their own creativity, ideas from other fields, inductive reasoning, Bayesian inference, and so on – to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. Albert Einstein once observed that 'there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles.'[i] Charles Sanders Peirce, borrowing a page from Aristotle (Prior Analytics, 2.25) described the incipient stages of inquiry, instigated by the 'irritation of doubt' to venture a plausible guess, as abductive reasoning.:\u200aII,\u200ap.290\u200a The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a 'flash of inspiration', or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. Michael Polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology. William Glen observes that the success of a hypothesis, or its service to science, lies not simply in its perceived 'truth', or power to displace, subsume or reduce a predecessor idea, but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate ... bald suppositions and areas of vagueness.—\u200aWilliam Glen, The Mass-Extinction Debates In general, scientists tend to look for theories that are 'elegant' or 'beautiful'. Scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is following the known facts but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle. Occam's Razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses. To minimize the confirmation bias that results from entertaining a single hypothesis, strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses, and avoiding artifacts. Predictions from the hypothesis "", 'Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those experimenting.

The process in the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypothetical explanations), \x1b[92m[1] deriving predictions from the hypotheses as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions\x1b[0m. A hypothesis is a conjecture based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method\nThe scientific method is the process by which science is carried out. As in other areas of inquiry, science (through the scientific method) can build on previous knowledge, and can unify understanding of its topics of study over time.[g] This model can be seen to underlie the scientific revolution. The overall process involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct. However, there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, these actions are better considered as general principles. Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always done in the same order. As noted by scientist and philosopher William Whewell (1794–1866), 'invention, sagacity, [and] genius' are required at every step. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method\nThe scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, imagination, and creativity. In this sense, it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow but is rather an ongoing cycle, constantly developing more useful, accurate, and comprehensive models and methods. For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's Principia. On the contrary, if the astronomically massive, the feather-light, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories – all phenomena Newton could not have observed – Newton's equations are what remain. Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase confidence in Newton's work. An iterative, pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding: Define a question Gather information and resources (observe) Form an explanatory hypothesis "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method\nHypothesis development Main article: Hypothesis formation Linus Pauling proposed that DNA might be a triple helix. This hypothesis was also considered by Francis Crick and James D. Watson but discarded. When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data that Pauling was wrong. and that Pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon, or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena. Normally, hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model. Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as existential statements, stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of universal statements, stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic. Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have – their own creativity, ideas from other fields, inductive reasoning, Bayesian inference, and so on – to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. Albert Einstein once observed that 'there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles.'[i] Charles Sanders Peirce, borrowing a page from Aristotle (Prior Analytics, 2.25) described the incipient stages of inquiry, instigated by the 'irritation of doubt' to venture a plausible guess, as abductive reasoning.:\u200aII,\u200ap.290\u200a The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a 'flash of inspiration', or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. Michael Polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology. William Glen observes that the success of a hypothesis, or its service to science, lies not simply in its perceived 'truth', or power to displace, subsume or reduce a predecessor idea, but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate ... bald suppositions and areas of vagueness.—\u200aWilliam Glen, The Mass-Extinction Debates In general, scientists tend to look for theories that are 'elegant' or 'beautiful'. Scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is following the known facts but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle. Occam's Razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses. To minimize the confirmation bias that results from entertaining a single hypothesis, strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses, and avoiding artifacts. Predictions from the hypothesis "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method\nScientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those experimenting. Detailed record-keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure.

For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river as a major transportation and trading route. In the five centuries before European colonization, the Mississippian culture built numerous regional chiefdoms and major earthwork mounds in the Ohio Valley like the Angel Mounds near Evansville, Indiana as well as in the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. The historic Osage, Omaha, Ponca, and Kaw peoples lived in the Ohio Valley. Under pressure over the fur trade from the Iroquois nations to the northeast, they migrated west of the Mississippi River in the 17th century to the territory now defined as Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. European discovery ', ""The combined Allegheny-Ohio river is 1,310 miles (2,110 km) long and carries the largest volume of water of any tributary of the Mississippi. The Indians and early European explorers and settlers of the region often considered the Allegheny to be part of the Ohio. The forks (the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Pittsburgh) were considered a strategic military location by colonial French and British, and later independent American military authorities. The confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers is at Cairo, Illinois. The river follows a roughly southwest and then west-northwest course until Cincinnati, before bending to a west-southwest course for most of the remainder of its length. The course forms the northern borders of West Virginia and Kentucky; and the southern borders of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, until it joins the Mississippi River at the city of Cairo, Illinois. Where the Ohio joins the Mississippi is the lowest elevation in the state of Illinois, at 315 feet (96 m). Natural-color satellite image of the Wabash-Ohio confluence The Mississippi River flows to the Gulf of Mexico on the Atlantic Ocean. Among rivers wholly or mostly in the United States, the Ohio is the second largest by discharge volume and the tenth longest and has the eighth largest drainage basin. It serves to separate the Midwestern Great Lakes states from the Upper South states, which were historically border states in the Civil War. The Ohio River is a left (east) and the largest tributary by volume of the Mississippi River in the United States. At the confluence, the Ohio is considerably bigger than the Mississippi, measured by long-term mean discharge. The Ohio River at Cairo is 281,500 cu ft/s (7,960 m3/s); and the Mississippi River at Thebes, Illinois, which is upstream of the confluence, is 208,200 cu ft/s (5,897 m3/s). The Ohio River flow is greater than that of the Mississippi River, so hydrologically the Ohio River is the main stream of the river system. River depth Lawrenceburg, Indiana, is one of many towns that use the Ohio as a shipping avenue. The Ohio River is a naturally shallow river that was artificially deepened by a series of dams. The natural depth of the river varied from about 3 to 20 feet (1 to 6 m). The dams raise the water level and have turned the river largely into a series of reservoirs, eliminating shallow stretches and allowing for commercial navigation. From its origin to Cincinnati, the average depth is approximately 15 feet (5 m). The largest immediate drop in water level is below the McAlpine Locks and Dam at the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, Kentucky, where flood stage is reached when the water reaches 23 feet (7 m) on the lower gauge. However, the river's deepest point is 168 feet (51 m) on the western side of Louisville, Kentucky.

The same year, the company opened a home office and first distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas. It had 38 stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of $44.2 million. It began trading stock as a publicly held company on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The first stock split occurred in May 1971 for $47 per share. By this time, Wal-Mart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As the company moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125 stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of $340.3 million. Wal-Mart logo from 1981 to 1992 In the 1980s, Wal-Mart briefly experimented with a precursor to the Supercenter, the Hyper-Mart. Four stores combined features of discount stores, supermarkets, pharmacies, video arcades, and other amenities. Wal-Mart continued to grow rapidly, and by the company's 25th anniversary in 1987, there were 1,198 Wal-Mart stores with sales of $15.9 billion and 200,000 associates. One reason for Wal-Mart's success between 1980 and 2000 is believed to be its contiguous pattern of expansion over time, building new distribution centers in a hub and spoke framework within driving distance of existing Supercenters. "", ""While it was the third-largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart was more profitable than rivals Kmart and Sears by the late 1980s. By 1990, it became the largest U.S. retailer by revenue. Prior to the summer of 1990, Wal-Mart had no presence on the West Coast or in the Northeast (except for a single Sam's Club in New Jersey which opened in November 1989), but in July and October that year, it opened its first stores in California and Pennsylvania, respectively. By the mid-1990s, it was the most powerful retailer in the U.S. and expanded into Mexico in 1991 and Canada in 1994. Wal-Mart stores opened throughout the rest of the U.S., with Vermont being the last state to get a store in 1995. The company also opened stores outside North America, entering South America in 1995 with stores in Argentina and Brazil; and Europe in July 1999, buying Asda in the United Kingdom for US$10 billion. In 1997, Wal-Mart was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In 1998, Wal-Mart introduced the Neighborhood Market concept with three stores in Arkansas. By 2005, estimates indicate that the company controlled about 20 percent of the retail grocery and consumables business. In 2000, H. Lee Scott became Wal-Mart's president and CEO as the company's sales increased to $165 billion. In 2002, it was listed for the first time as America's largest corporation on the Fortune 500 list, with revenues of $219.8 billion and profits of $6.7 billion.

Kanye decided to create a line of sneakers specifically for football which debuted in an NFL kickoff game in 2016. While the athletes loved these, DeAndre Hopkins, a wide receiver on the Houston Texas, was fined $6,000 by the NFL for having these Yeezy 350 Cleats on. That’s because when the cleats were designed, they did not have a strong enough base color, which is part of the NFL’s kit policy. During this same year, Yeezy released even more color schemes (like Beluga, Zebra, Black and White, and Cream White) for its highly successful Yeezy Boost 350 line, during the third season of Yeezy. Beyond updating the colors, the Yeezy brand also updated the structural components of the shoe and eliminated the heel tab. 2017: The Yeezy Powerphase Calabasas & Yeezy Boost 700 ', ""https://www.hatchwise.com/resources/the-history-of-the-yeezy\nUnlike sneakers that were designed outside of United States, this Adidas Yeezy sneaker was designed in the States. The brand sold this directly on its website in June 2020 for a price of $75, cheaper than their past shoe designs. This sneaker was different because Kanye had the idea to use harvested algae for some elements of the shoes, making it even more unique. 2021: The Yeezy 450 & Yeezy 500 The Yeezy brand continued its partnership with Adidas, which became an unstoppable collaboration.  The duo released the Yeezy 450 in March 2021. This was released in a 'cloud white,' color before being released in a dark gray. These sneakers retailed at $200, and they resemble Yeezy’s signature, futuristic, out-of-the-box style.

Among the Phaeacians Athena is not totally absent, as in Odysseus’s adventures, nor is she totally present, as when he returns home. She is both present and absent, and this is a distinctive feature of the Phaeacian episode. The Phaeacians themselves are liminal creatures, halfway between the unreal world of Odysseus’s adventures—the world of Calypso, Circe, and the Cyclops—and the real world as it is represented in the Odyssey—Ithaca, Pylos, and Sparta. Part of the Phaeacians’ unreality is that they act for Athena, as if in a play which she directs. Zeus lays out Odysseus’ entire nostos in advance, when he sends Hermes to release Odysseus from Calypso’s island. He decrees that the Phaeacians will welcome Odysseus and honor him like a god, and send him home with greater riches than he once won in Troy (5.34–40). But it is Athena’s role to implement this plan, and the Phaeacians thus seem to be actors under her direction. ', ""To repeat a point made earlier, the Phaeacians seem to exist midway between the unreal world of Odysseus’s adventures and the real world of his homecoming. Their liminal status is expressed in different ways. They were once neighbors of the Cyclopes, but moved away to a new home to escape those overbearing creatures who were too strong for them and brought them harm. They are thus removed from the world of Odysseus’s adventures, but connected to that world nonetheless. In the same way they do not live in the real world, but they are connected to the real world, as when they bring Odysseus home to Ithaca, and as they once traveled as far as Euboea to take Rhadamanthys to see Tityos. Compared to creatures like the Cyclops, but also to Circe and Calypso, the Phaeacians seem quite human, and indeed mortal. When Odysseus takes his leave from the Phaeacians he wishes queen Arete well until old age and death overcome her, as is the way with human beings (13.59–60). The queen in the end has thus receded from her initial eminence as a full-blown image of Athena Polias and become simply herself, a mortal woman. On the other hand the Phaeacians are distinctly more than human—how else could the princess and the queen represent two aspects of the goddess Athena? This more than human quality is well expressed in the Phaeacians’ epithet ἀγχίθεοι, 'close to the gods' (5.35, 19.279), for to be 'close to the gods' is not to be gods, but also not to be ordinary mortals. It is to be between the two. "", 'The Phaeacians have a king and queen, Alcinous and Arete, who evoke the origins of the Neleids, the royal family of Miletus, at two stages in their history, Pylos and Athens. Nestor represents Pylos in the Homeric poems, and king Alcinous is a second Nestor. Athena Polias represents Athens, and queen Arete embodies the city goddess of Athens. Arete is also a generation younger than Alcinous, her father’s brother, and this difference corresponds to the two successive stages in the Neleids’ family history, Pylos and Athens. ', 'The Phaeacians are not meant to represent one powerful family that ruled in Miletus, but the entire dodecapolis, which celebrated a common festival called the Panionia in a place called Panionion on cape Mykale. Nestor, whose twin myth goes back to Indo-European origins, has his twin myth deliberately hidden in Homer in favor of a tradition that he was one of twelve sons of Neleus. These twelve sons match in number the twelve cities of the dodecapolis, but they are a purely notional group, only two of whom, Nestor and Periclymenos, have real substance. The only son of Neleus associated with a particular city among the twelve cities is Periclymenus, the ancestor of the royal family of Miletus, and he is mentioned only once in the Homeric poems (Odyssey 11.286). Nestor, who plays prominent roles in both Homeric poems, cannot be associated with a particular Ionian city, any more than the ten other supposed sons of Neleus can. The Neleids of Miletus, whose pedigree is the basis of Panionian ideology, did not wish to call attention to themselves. What they wanted instead was to foster a Panionic community in their own image.

The Phaeacians have a festive way of life because they represent an actual festival. It was at this recurring festival, I argue, that the Iliad and Odyssey assumed monumental proportions over several years in the late eighth and early seventh centuries BC.

Alcinous is the son of his city’s founder, in whose place he now rules. This is Nestor’s profile, and the Odyssey uses identical language and parallel scenes to delineate both figures, first Nestor in his city, and then Alcinous in his city. The Phaeacian king’s portrait is drawn as soon as the Phaeacians appear on stage and their city, its founding, and its present ruler are described. The stage for this was set when Nestor, the morning after Telemachus’s arrival, sat down on the shining white stones where his father had sat before him.

The story line intertwines the dangers which Creegan’s professional life poses for his post-divorce family with two cases, a personal vendetta against Creegan and matter of a high-stakes international 'pedophiliac' ring. The common theme is the vulnerability of children, explored to the counterpoint of the most explicit and voluminous violence in the 'Touching Evil' series.

Related Posts "", ""'Evil' is much more engaging, however, than a mere odd-couple cop show, or even a good serial-killer series. Taking cues from the surreality of '12 Monkeys' and the Hughes brothers’ hyper-stylized 'From Hell' (no surprise, since the brothers and Bruce Willis are among the exec producers), 'Evil' has created one bitter little fairyland. It’s a place where day and night twist into each other quite regularly: Creegan suffers insomnia and sometimes dreams while awake. His adopted best friend, Cyril (the pinball-eyed Pruitt Taylor Vince), is a schizophrenic who, when not properly dosed, believes Creegan is the one kindly figure in his endless nightmare. If he can only wake up he’ll be back on his proper planet. "", ""A new season of Touching Evil, starring Robson Green as D.I. Dave Creegan, Nicola Walker as D.I. Susan Taylor, and Shaun Dingwall as D.C. Mark Rivers -- members of London's elite Organized and Serial Crime Unit (OSC). This time out, the OSC loses one of its own to a serial killer who specializes in removing the heart from his victims (Episodes 1 and 2), and Creegan gets burned -- literally -- by a murderer who prefers fire as a means of personal expression (Episodes 3 and 4). 2109 • Creegan returns from psychiatric sick leave to clear a killer he helped convict. But the local police chief remains convinced the man is guilty -- especially since the murder spree resumes after his release. All victims, to date, are married women with their hearts neatly cut out and left nearby in garbage bags. 2110 • "", ""Touching Evil has always been one of my favorite crime dramas, and a lot of that has to do with the strong performance of lead actor Robson Green. I’ve seen him in a lot before and since, and he really knows how to dig into a character and carry a show. His Creegan is conflicted, certainly with enough to angst about, but Green’s wry wit keeps him from being the brooding hero in the corner. I’ve heard some disparage the performance of Nicola Walker (Spooks/MI-5) as his partner, Susan Taylor, but she’s serviceable for the part and at least is a decent match for him, even if she doesn’t stand out.

The story line intertwines the dangers which Creegan’s professional life poses for his post-divorce family with two cases, a personal vendetta against Creegan and matter of a high-stakes international 'pedophiliac' ring. The common theme is the vulnerability of children, explored to the counterpoint of the most explicit and voluminous violence in the 'Touching Evil' series. Whether agreeing or not that the subject matter and violence contained here is warranted, the viewer will be left with a plate full of food for thought regarding 'cops and robbers' and the complex inner lives of Creegan and company.

Taking cues from the surreality of '12 Monkeys' and the Hughes brothers’ hyper-stylized 'From Hell' (no surprise, since the brothers and Bruce Willis are among the exec producers), 'Evil' has created one bitter little fairyland. It’s a place where day and night twist into each other quite regularly: Creegan suffers insomnia and sometimes dreams while awake. His adopted best friend, Cyril (the pinball-eyed Pruitt Taylor Vince), is a schizophrenic who, when not properly dosed, believes Creegan is the one kindly figure in his endless nightmare. If he can only wake up he’ll be back on his proper planet. "", ""https://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_19E58B594F4B46A68268528342554297\nA new season of Touching Evil, starring Robson Green as D.I.

I’ve seen him in a lot before and since, and he really knows how to dig into a character and carry a show. His Creegan is conflicted, certainly with enough to angst about, but Green’s wry wit keeps him from being the brooding hero in the corner. I’ve heard some disparage the performance of Nicola Walker (Spooks/MI-5) as his partner, Susan Taylor, but she’s serviceable for the part and at least is a decent match for him, even if she doesn’t stand out.

Small steps are so much easier to take, because they are less daunting and you can already start tomorrow. When you have taken the first small step, the second small step will be even easier, because you are already moving! So, my invitation to you is: Take a small step today and be surprised what it brings you. Just think of something you want to change. What small step can you take today? If you have trouble coming up with a small action. Just send me an email and tell me what you want to change and I’ll think along with you to find a small action you can take today.  (Coming up with practical, small steps is one of my superpowers! So try me ! 😊) P.S. If you want to know more about the power of small steps, read the book Emotional Agility by Susan David, PhD. She has a chapter on what she calls 'tiny tweaks' (which are small steps) that can have a big impact. "", ""Now I don’t know anything about running a marathon, so don’t take advice from me about that, but I do know something about small steps, because (although I didn’t know it at the time) it’s how I wrote and published my first novel. It was the book Your Best Year Yet that helped me break my goal down into manageable chunks all those years ago. The two rules that make an action a small step: A small step seems like a manageable thing. You can conceptualize it. You can imagine yourself doing it. I can imagine going to the doctor’s, going for a walk for half an hour a day, or picking up a leaflet from the gym on the way home. A small step can be carried out today. Firstly, it’s time bound. You know how much time (roughly) it would take. You could do it today, and you can identify a point in your day when – even though it might be difficult or inconvenient – you could carry it out. Planning to do it tomorrow works, as long as you make a concrete plan. Otherwise, your step isn’t small enough – get smaller. Because of these two rules, you should be able to: WRITE DOWN YOUR SMALL STEP, starting with a verb. Click here to find out why verbs are so important. Work out how long it will take and when you’ll do it, and WRITE IT DOWN. Let’s try breaking these down into small steps: Write a novel. Get a new job. Build your own home. Remember, your first reaction might be too general and non-committal. Your immediate emotional response is a good test – if you don’t really want to achieve your goal, move on. So, next stage is to get more specific. Here are some specific steps for 'Write a novel': "", 'Notice that a lot of these first small steps are similar or the same. Borrow a book, sign up for a course, speak to someone who’s already done it, write down the goal, identify your skills, try out a new skill in a small way. All of these could apply to running a marathon, writing a novel, finding a new job, or building your own home. Most of these are either free, or low cost, or could be. The great thing about small steps is that once you’ve broken it down, you get to something you could fit in today, and that is usually free. Time and money – the two big reasons we use not to do stuff – no longer apply. Remember: great things start with small steps!

If you have trouble coming up with a small action. Just send me an email and tell me what you want to change and I’ll think along with you to find a small action you can take today.  (Coming up with practical, small steps is one of my superpowers! So try me ! 😊) P.S. If you want to know more about the power of small steps, read the book Emotional Agility by Susan David, PhD. She has a chapter on what she calls 'tiny tweaks' (which are small steps) that can have a big impact. "", ""https://www.smallstepsguide.co.uk/take-small-steps/\nNow I don’t know anything about running a marathon, so don’t take advice from me about that, but I do know something about small steps, because (although I didn’t know it at the time) it’s how I wrote and published my first novel. It was the book Your Best Year Yet that helped me break my goal down into manageable chunks all those years ago. The two rules that make an action a small step: A small step seems like a manageable thing. You can conceptualize it. You can imagine yourself doing it. I can imagine going to the doctor’s, going for a walk for half an hour a day, or picking up a leaflet from the gym on the way home. A small step can be carried out today. Firstly, it’s time bound. You know how much time (roughly) it would take. You could do it today, and you can identify a point in your day when – even though it might be difficult or inconvenient – you could carry it out. Planning to do it tomorrow works, as long as you make a concrete plan. Otherwise, your step isn’t small enough – get smaller. Because of these two rules, you should be able to: WRITE DOWN YOUR SMALL STEP, starting with a verb. Click here to find out why verbs are so important. Work out how long it will take and when you’ll do it, and WRITE IT DOWN. Let’s try breaking these down into small steps: Write a novel. Get a new job. Build your own home. Remember, your first reaction might be too general and non-committal. Your immediate emotional response is a good test – if you don’t really want to achieve your goal, move on. So, next stage is to get more specific. Here are some specific steps for 'Write a novel': "", 'https://www.smallstepsguide.co.uk/take-small-steps/\nNotice that a lot of these first small steps are similar or the same. Borrow a book, sign up for a course, speak to someone who’s already done it, write down the goal, identify your skills, try out a new skill in a small way. All of these could apply to running a marathon, writing a novel, finding a new job, or building your own home. Most of these are either free, or low cost, or could be. The great thing about small steps is that once you’ve broken it down, you get to something you could fit in today, and that is usually free. Time and money – the two big reasons we use not to do stuff – no longer apply. Remember: great things start with small steps!

Discography "", ""Created by two thirds of Swedish House Mafia during the group’s mid-2010s hiatus, 'More Than You Know' is pure EDM perfection, fusing an earworm melody with a funky little guitar riff and singalong lyrics about yearning and respect and desire. A late EDM era classic, the Grammy-nominated track still gets rinsed during Swedish House Mafia’s sets, now that the trio has reunited. Loving Lyrics: 'You should know that baby, you’re the best, yeah more than you know.' Kaytranada Feat. H.E.R., 'Intimidated' (2021) Image Credit: Liam Macrae A jam for anyone who’s ever felt like the object of their affection was out of their league, this come-hither jam from Kaytra and H.E.R. is delivered from the perspective of the intimidating one, who beckons the other to stop wasting time and just come closer already. Loving lyrics: 'Don’t run away, when you could be lovin’ me.' Axwell, 'Centre of the Universe' (2013) Image Credit: Brian Killian/WireImage "", ""The London dubstep super-trio’s (Skream, Benga and Artwork) infectious first single explores how love can be simultaneously intoxicating and smothering. Loving Lyrics: 'Now I’m drowning in your ocean, and I’m running and feeling like I don’t care. You penetrate my space and now you’re looking outta place. Cause you make this hard for me — I need air.' Moore Kismet feat. Pauline Herr, 'You Should Run' (2020) Image Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/GI Released when Moore Kismet was just 17, this hypnotic debut single highlights love and longing. Loving Lyrics: 'I’d run way with you if I could, if I could. No one understands me the way that you do.' Late Night Alumni, 'Empty Streets' (2005) Image Credit: Michael Tullberg/GI Kaskade’s four-piece house outfit hit its stride on this contemplative street-lit ballad. Loving Lyrics: 'If this love’s not meant to be. If the heart’s not ready to open. If we make it, I won’t see how it’s broken.' "", ""Loving Lyrics: 'I will give to you the love you seek and more. So what are you waiting for?' Oliver Heldens x Becky Hill, 'Gecko (Overdrive)' (2014) Image Credit: Mark Davis/GI The rising Dutch star topped the U.K. singles chart after Becky Hill channeled feelings of overwhelming attraction over his high-octane instrumental.

The primate of the Church of Sweden is the Archbishop of Uppsala. Other Protestant denominations The 19th century saw the arrival of various evangelical free churches, and, towards the end of the century secularism, leading many to distance themselves from church rituals. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called Dissenter Act of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another denomination. The right to not belong to any religious denomination was established in the law on freedom of religion in 1951.

He was born in 1943 and raised in an Irish Catholic family. He was raised mostly by his Irish grandmother, his father having been an alcoholic.

He received an Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for his role as a Nazi SS officer in the 1978 miniseries Holocaust and a Tony Award in 1974 for his performance in the play Find Your Way Home. He played Executive Assistant District Attorney Benjamin Stone for the first four seasons (1990–1994) of the television show Law & Order. Moriarty is also known for his roles in films such as Bang the Drum Slowly, Who'll Stop the Rain, Q: The Winged Serpent, The Stuff, Pale Rider, Troll, Courage Under Fire, and Shiloh. Early life "", ""From 1990 to 1994, Moriarty starred as Executive Assistant District Attorney Ben Stone on Law & Order. He left the show in 1994, alleging that his departure was a result of his threatening a lawsuit against then-Attorney General Janet Reno, who had cited Law & Order as offensively violent. Moriarty criticized Reno's comment and claimed that she wanted to censor not only shows such as Law & Order, but also such fare as Murder, She Wrote. He later accused Law & Order executive producer Dick Wolf of not taking his concerns seriously and claimed that Wolf and other network executives were 'caving in' to Reno's 'demands' on the issue of TV violence. On September 20, 1994, on The Howard Stern Show, he made an offer to NBC, claiming that he would return to his role on the show if Wolf was fired. Moriarty published a full-page advertisement in a Hollywood trade magazine calling upon fellow artists to stand up with him against attempts to censor TV show content. He subsequently wrote and published The Gift of Stern Angels, his account of this time in his life. In the fictional Law & Order universe, Ben Stone resigns from the D.A.'s office in 1994 after a witness in one of his cases is murdered. The February 7, 2018, episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit shows Sam Waterston's character, Jack McCoy, delivering a eulogy at Stone's funeral. "", ""It took Jill Hennessy nearly a season to shake off the slight dullness that may have been her legacy from Richard Brooks, who played Ben Stone’s original sidekick, Paul Robinette. Brooks was very dull indeed – until his guest-star return in 'Custody,' where the long-absent Robinette loses the flattop that never looked right on him and is reborn as an activist for the African American causes he had to let pass him by in his days in the Manhattan D.A.’s office. Hennessy, always a trifle cowed by Moriarty, came into her own when Waterston joined the series. She seemed to feel freer to use her body; she turned into the sexiest feminist on TV – a welcome anomaly in a puritanical era. Carey Lowell, who stepped in as D.A. Jamie Ross when Hennessy left, is highly competent and has an underused penchant for comedy: her best moment so far has been the grilling of a credulous attorney (Robert Stanton) who fell for her airhead-novice act in 'Shadow.' But the show has yet to spotlight Lowell or Ross in a distinctive way. "", ""Michael Moriarty, the divisive, strange, and brilliant actor who brought Executive ADA Benjamin Stone to life, too had similar struggles. It hadn’t interfered with his work on the show until Season 4 came around in September 1993. Then Michael Moriarty completely self-destructed, and any issues that were caused all came to a head in an ugly slugfest between Moriarty, Dick Wolf and the producers, the suits at NBC, and the fucking United States federal government. Whether the story has a happy ending depends entirely on you, and your point of view. I’ll say this, it’s a happier ending than I thought it was. Which is a good thing, because back when I was that dope sick and emotionally disturbed person lying on that couch, the guy who I could kind of identify with was Ben. Like him, I’m a slightly soft spoken and somewhat socially awkward, but at the same time intelligent, deceptively tough, and highly empathetic, White guy of chiefly Irish-English descent with a receding hairline and something of a Charlie Brown face, though Stone is taller than me (at 6'3-6'4, Moriarty was considered one of the tallest actors in Hollywood in the ‘70s and ‘80s) and much more assertive than I am. His actor struggled with a psychological disorder and substance abuse problems for most of his adult life. Being in such a raw emotional state as I was during those times viewing the show on that couch, and relating to the character and the depression that hangs over his onscreen and off-screen exit as much as I did, it’s probably no surprise that of all the characters I’ve written about already and of all the ones I will do write-ups on in the future, my favorite is Ben Stone.

He was the Executive Assistant District Attorney for New York County until his resignation at the end of season four. He appeared in 88 episodes. Character overview Stone works in the Manhattan District Attorney's office under Alfred Wentworth (Roy Thinnes, in the pilot episode 'Everybody's Favorite Bagman') and Adam Schiff (Steven Hill). He was born in 1943 and raised in an Irish Catholic family. He was raised mostly by his Irish grandmother, his father having been an alcoholic. Stone is divorced and has a son, Peter Stone (Philip Winchester), who was the Deputy Chief of the Special Prosecutions Bureau in Chicago and was the Chief ADA of the Sex Crimes Bureau in New York, and a daughter, Pamela (Amy Korb). Stone's prosecutorial methods are portrayed as being grounded in moral principles stemming from his Catholic faith. He is shown to be anti-abortion and opposed to the death penalty. He also is a strong advocate of social justice, having marched in the civil rights movement. It is implied that Stone, like actor Moriarty, is a Dartmouth College alumnus, with references to 'fraternity row' and New Hampshire. Stone is also likely a graduate of New York University Law School, evidenced by the diplomas on his wall in several episodes. Career within the show Stone became Executive Assistant DA in 1985 after convicting con artist and murderer Philip Swann (Željko Ivanek), who years later enters a civil suit against Stone when the validity of the conviction is called into question. Swann is ultimately found guilty, however, and sent back to prison. Stone's assistants have been Paul Robinette (Richard Brooks) and Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennessy). Stone makes his last appearance in the show in the episode 'Old Friends,' the final episode of season four. The episode portrays a racketeering case in which the main witness, Ann Madsen (Allison Janney), whose testimony Stone had secured by threatening to send her to prison, is murdered by the Russian Mafia. He feels responsible for her death and resigns from the DA's office. He is succeeded by Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) as Executive ADA. Post-departure "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moriarty\nMichael MoriartyBorn (1941-04-05) April 5, 1941 (age 83)Detroit, Michigan, U.S.EducationUniversity of Detroit Jesuit H.S.Alma materDartmouth College (BA)London Academy of Music and Dramatic ArtOccupationActorYears active1971–presentAwardsTony Award (1974)Golden Globe Award (1979)Emmy Award (1974, 1978, 2002) Michael Moriarty (born April 5, 1941) is an American-Canadian actor. He received an Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for his role as a Nazi SS officer in the 1978 miniseries Holocaust and a Tony Award in 1974 for his performance in the play Find Your Way Home. He played Executive Assistant District Attorney Benjamin Stone for the first four seasons (1990–1994) of the television show Law & Order. Moriarty is also known for his roles in films such as Bang the Drum Slowly, Who'll Stop the Rain, Q: The Winged Serpent, The Stuff, Pale Rider, Troll, Courage Under Fire, and Shiloh. Early life "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moriarty\nFrom 1990 to 1994, Moriarty starred as Executive Assistant District Attorney Ben Stone on Law & Order. He left the show in 1994, alleging that his departure was a result of his threatening a lawsuit against then-Attorney General Janet Reno, who had cited Law & Order as offensively violent. Moriarty criticized Reno's comment and claimed that she wanted to censor not only shows such as Law & Order, but also such fare as Murder, She Wrote. He later accused Law & Order executive producer Dick Wolf of not taking his concerns seriously and claimed that Wolf and other network executives were 'caving in' to Reno's 'demands' on the issue of TV violence. On September 20, 1994, on The Howard Stern Show, he made an offer to NBC, claiming that he would return to his role on the show if Wolf was fired. Moriarty published a full-page advertisement in a Hollywood trade magazine calling upon fellow artists to stand up with him against attempts to censor TV show content. He subsequently wrote and published The Gift of Stern Angels, his account of this time in his life. In the fictional Law & Order universe, Ben Stone resigns from the D.A.'s office in 1994 after a witness in one of his cases is murdered. The February 7, 2018, episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit shows Sam Waterston's character, Jack McCoy, delivering a eulogy at Stone's funeral. "", ""https://www.criticsatlarge.ca/2014/07/law-order-actors-paradise.html\nIt took Jill Hennessy nearly a season to shake off the slight dullness that may have been her legacy from Richard Brooks, who played Ben Stone’s original sidekick, Paul Robinette. Brooks was very dull indeed – until his guest-star return in 'Custody,' where the long-absent Robinette loses the flattop that never looked right on him and is reborn as an activist for the African American causes he had to let pass him by in his days in the Manhattan D.A.’s office. Hennessy, always a trifle cowed by Moriarty, came into her own when Waterston joined the series. She seemed to feel freer to use her body; she turned into the sexiest feminist on TV – a welcome anomaly in a puritanical era. Carey Lowell, who stepped in as D.A. Jamie Ross when Hennessy left, is highly competent and has an underused penchant for comedy: her best moment so far has been the grilling of a credulous attorney (Robert Stanton) who fell for her airhead-novice act in 'Shadow.' But the show has yet to spotlight Lowell or Ross in a distinctive way. "", ""https://www.reddit.com/r/LawAndOrder/comments/12hlala/the_exits_executive_assistant_district_attorney/\nMichael Moriarty, the divisive, strange, and brilliant actor who brought Executive ADA Benjamin Stone to life, too had similar struggles. It hadn’t interfered with his work on the show until Season 4 came around in September 1993. Then Michael Moriarty completely self-destructed, and any issues that were caused all came to a head in an ugly slugfest between Moriarty, Dick Wolf and the producers, the suits at NBC, and the fucking United States federal government. Whether the story has a happy ending depends entirely on you, and your point of view. I’ll say this, it’s a happier ending than I thought it was. Which is a good thing, because back when I was that dope sick and emotionally disturbed person lying on that couch, the guy who I could kind of identify with was Ben. Like him, I’m a slightly soft spoken and somewhat socially awkward, but at the same time intelligent, deceptively tough, and highly empathetic, White guy of chiefly Irish-English descent with a receding hairline and something of a Charlie Brown face, though Stone is taller than me (at 6'3-6'4, Moriarty was considered one of the tallest actors in Hollywood in the ‘70s and ‘80s) and much more assertive than I am. His actor struggled with a psychological disorder and substance abuse problems for most of his adult life. Being in such a raw emotional state as I was during those times viewing the show on that couch, and relating to the character and the depression that hangs over his onscreen and off-screen exit as much as I did, it’s probably no surprise that of all the characters I’ve written about already and of all the ones I will do write-ups on in the future, my favorite is Ben Stone.

It came into force on 7 July 2000, 23 years after the collapse of the previous community and its organs. A customs union was signed in March 2004, which commenced on 1 January 2005. Kenya, the region's largest exporter, continued to pay duties on goods entering the other four countries on a declining scale until 2010. A common system of tariffs will apply to goods imported from third-party countries. On 30 November 2016 it was declared that the immediate aim would be confederation rather than federation. South Sudan's accession In December 2012, Tanzania agreed to South Sudan's bid to join the EAC, clearing the way for the world's newest state to become the regional bloc's sixth member. In May 2013 the EAC set aside US$82,000 for the admission of South Sudan into the bloc even though admission may not happen until 2016. The process, to start after the EAC Council of Ministers meeting in August 2013, was projected to take at least four years. At the 14th Ordinary Summit held in Nairobi in 2012, EAC heads of state approved the verification report that was presented by the Council of Ministers, then directed it to start the negotiation process with South Sudan. A team was formed to assess South Sudan's bid; however, in April 2014, the nation requested a delay in the admissions process, presumably due to ongoing internal conflict.

United States president Abraham Lincoln—under pressure from the public that urged the army 'On to Richmond!'—went against the advice of his aging general-in-chief Winfield Scott and ordered an attack. Largely untrained Union troops under Irvin McDowell marched to Centreville and then to Manassas Junction, where McDowell hoped to cut the railroad running into the Shenandoah Valley. He failed, and Confederate troops (equally untrained) under Joseph E. Johnston rode the rails from the Valley to Manassas, where they united with P. G. T. Beauregard‘s army and met McDowell along Bull Run on July 21. The battle was marked by confusion, with Union and Confederate troops wearing similar uniforms and flying similar flags. When it looked as if the Union troops might prevail, Virginians under the command of Thomas J. Jackson rallied on Henry House Hill, where he earned his famous nickname 'Stonewall.' The Union army was routed in front of spectators from Washington, D.C., and politicians and generals on both sides were left to acknowledge the possibility that the war would last longer than they had thought.

The fierce fight there forced both the North and South to face the sobering reality that the war would be long and bloody. How it ended Confederate victory. After this stinging defeat for the Union, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, the commander of the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia, was relieved and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who set about reorganizing and training what would become the Army of the Potomac. In context ', 'On July 16, the Union 90-day volunteer army under McDowell—around 35,000 troops with great enthusiasm and little training—sets out from Washington, D.C. The Confederates under Beauregard, equally green, are positioned behind Bull Run Creek west of Centreville. They aim to block the Union army advance on the Confederate capital by defending the railroad junction at Manassas, just west of the creek. The railroads there connect the strategically important Shenandoah Valley with the Virginia interior. Another Confederate army under Gen. Joseph E. Johnston operates in the Valley and is poised to reinforce Beauregard. McDowell’s plan is to make quick work of Beauregard’s force before Johnston can join him. ', ""On July 18, McDowell’s army reached Centreville. Five miles ahead a small meandering stream named Bull Run crossed the route of the Union advance. Guarding the fords from Union Mills to the Stone Bridge were 22,000 Southern troops under the command of Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard. McDowell first attempted to move toward the Confederate right flank, but his troops were checked at Blackburn’s Ford. He then spent the next two days scouting the Southern left flank. In the meantime, Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army, stationed in the Shenandoah Valley with 10,000 Confederate troops, were ordered to support Beauregard. Johnston gave an opposing Union army the slip and, employing the Manassas Gap Railroad, started his brigades toward Manassas Junction, with most arriving July 20 and 21.

Southerners called it the Battle of Manassas, after the closest town. Northerners called it Bull Run, after a stream running through the battlefield. After a Confederate artillery fired on Fort Sumter in April, members of Congress complained about the Union army's inactivity. They traded rumors that President Abraham Lincoln was delaying military action in order to forge a compromise with the South. They demanded a quick campaign to prevent the Confederate Congress from convening in Richmond. Horace Greeley's New York Tribune summed up the sentiment with repeated headlines that demanded: 'Forward to Richmond!' Such outcries pressured Lincoln to launch an offensive.

Meanwhile, McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support. Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across 300 yards (270 m) against Jackson's 13. Unlike many engagements in the Civil War, here the Confederate artillery had an advantage. The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges, with many shots fired over the head of their targets.

The battle is described from the viewpoint of a Union infantryman in Upton Sinclair's novella Manassas, which also depicts the political turmoil leading up to the Civil War. The battle is also depicted in John Jakes's The Titans, the fifth novel in The Kent Family Chronicles, a series that explores the fictional Confederate cavalry officer Gideon Kent.

United States president Abraham Lincoln—under pressure from the public that urged the army 'On to Richmond!'—went against the advice of his aging general-in-chief Winfield Scott and ordered an attack. Largely untrained Union troops under Irvin McDowell marched to Centreville and then to Manassas Junction, where McDowell hoped to cut the railroad running into the Shenandoah Valley. He failed, and Confederate troops (equally untrained) under Joseph E. Johnston rode the rails from the Valley to Manassas, where they united with P. G. T. Beauregard‘s army and met McDowell along Bull Run on July 21. The battle was marked by confusion, with Union and Confederate troops wearing similar uniforms and flying similar flags. When it looked as if the Union troops might prevail, Virginians under the command of Thomas J. Jackson rallied on Henry House Hill, where he earned his famous nickname 'Stonewall.' The Union army was routed in front of spectators from Washington, D.C., and politicians and generals on both sides were left to acknowledge the possibility that the war would last longer than they had thought.

The fierce fight there forced both the North and South to face the sobering reality that the war would be long and bloody. How it ended Confederate victory. After this stinging defeat for the Union, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, the commander of the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia, was relieved and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who set about reorganizing and training what would become the Army of the Potomac.

The Confederates under Beauregard, equally green, are positioned behind Bull Run Creek west of Centreville. They aim to block the Union army advance on the Confederate capital by defending the railroad junction at Manassas, just west of the creek. The railroads there connect the strategically important Shenandoah Valley with the Virginia interior. Another Confederate army under Gen. Joseph E. Johnston operates in the Valley and is poised to reinforce Beauregard. McDowell’s plan is to make quick work of Beauregard’s force before Johnston can join him.

Five miles ahead a small meandering stream named Bull Run crossed the route of the Union advance. Guarding the fords from Union Mills to the Stone Bridge were 22,000 Southern troops under the command of Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard. McDowell first attempted to move toward the Confederate right flank, but his troops were checked at Blackburn’s Ford. He then spent the next two days scouting the Southern left flank. In the meantime, Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army, stationed in the Shenandoah Valley with 10,000 Confederate troops, were ordered to support Beauregard. Johnston gave an opposing Union army the slip and, employing the Manassas Gap Railroad, started his brigades toward Manassas Junction, with most arriving July 20 and 21.

Southerners called it the Battle of Manassas, after the closest town. Northerners called it Bull Run, after a stream running through the battlefield. After a Confederate artillery fired on Fort Sumter in April, members of Congress complained about the Union army's inactivity. They traded rumors that President Abraham Lincoln was delaying military action in order to forge a compromise with the South. They demanded a quick campaign to prevent the Confederate Congress from convening in Richmond. Horace Greeley's New York Tribune summed up the sentiment with repeated headlines that demanded: 'Forward to Richmond!' Such outcries pressured Lincoln to launch an offensive.

He wrote the song six months after that breakup, co-writing it with Tony Wilson of the group Hot Chocolate two years before it became a hit. After recording 'Just When I Needed You Most' for an album recorded for the UK division of Bearsville Records, VanWarmer then flew to the US to pressure Bearsville's head office to promote the album which was duly remixed and released with 'Just When I Needed You Most' as lead single although VanWarmer would recall that Bearsville evinced little enthusiasm for the track: 'Nobody thought my version was an especially good version of the song [which] a few other people were thinking of cutting...Everybody just assumed mine was a demo for people to listen to who'd [then] cut the definitive version'.

Released as a single in February 1979, VanWarmer's 'Just When I Needed You Most' spent two weeks atop the US Billboard adult contemporary chart in May of that year and in June 1979 reached its peak position of No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, accruing an overall Top 40 tenure of 14 weeks and earning RIAA Gold record status. In addition, the track reached No. 71 on the Billboard country music chart. and in September 1979 made the Top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 8. VanWarmer attributed his single's success to empathy for its heartbreak scenario: 'It's happened to everyone. That emotion is universal...I always hoped the record wasn't wallowing in self-pity and it had some redeeming value, and I guess it does.' VanWarmer also attributed his single's success to the autoharp instrumental break between the second and third verses, performed by John Sebastian.

Security Council resolutions are often ignored While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, they are also frequently violated. The U.N. director for the International Crisis Group, Richard Gowan, told PBS NewsHour that past calls for cease-fires have been passed 'with little or no impact.' A 2002 analysis found that, at the time, at least 91 Security Council resolutions were being ignored.

The council is called upon to tackle crises around the world and has the power to impose legally binding measures on UN members, including measures related to the use of force. The council is also responsible for overseeing the complex and dangerous work of the UN’s more than two dozen peacekeeping and political missions. Many see the council as dominated by its five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States), who, in addition to their veto power, can leverage their tenure, institutional memory and greater resources to determine council outcomes. ', 'As such, it can, for example, recommend procedures or methods for peaceful settlement of disputes, authorize use of force, implement a peacekeeping operation, create sanctions regimes, establish international criminal courts or extend the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Under the Charter of the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council is made up of five permanent members with veto rights. These permanent members are France, the United States, Russia, China and the United Kingdom. The Security Council also has ten elected members. They are elected by the United Nations General Assembly for a two year term. France is a permanent member of the Security Council. What does that mean? France was one of the UN’s founding members in 1945. It is a Security Council member and has a permanent seat like the United States, China, United Kingdom and Russia, under the Charter of the United Nations. As a nuclear-weapon State and intervention and mediation power present in numerous theatres of operation, including within peacekeeping operations, France plays a leading role in the management of numerous international crises, the promotion of human rights and respect for international law, especially international humanitarian law in conflict environments. The five permanent members may use their veto to prevent a resolution from being adopted. France has not used its veto since 1989. What is the Presidency of the Security Council? The Presidency of the Council is carried out by each of the permanent and non-permanent members of the Council for a period of one month on a rotational basis according to alphabetic order in English. ', 'The General Assembly is the UN’s main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ. Since 2011, the EU is an observer member with enhanced status at the UN General Assembly. This allows the EU to present common positions, make interventions, present proposals and participate in the general debate each September. The added value of the EU is to coordinate among its 27 Member States to present a unified position. The EU coordinates its voting within the UN General Assembly’s six main committees, as well as other bodies and agencies such as the Economic and Social Council. UN Security Council The Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It has 15 Members, and each Member has one vote ', ""There are five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the United States, China, Russia, France and the United Kingdom) while a further 10 non-permanent members are elected for two-year terms. Yesterday, Mexico, India, Ireland and Norway became the latest countries to be elected while the 193 UN member states will meet again today to decide who will fill the final vacant seat. Countries pump a lot of money into their bids to get elected to the Security Council and it is estimated that Ireland spent over €840,000 on its efforts over the past three years while Norway and Canada each spent approximately €2 million. Such campaigns are interesting affairs and major charm offensives. For example, Ireland invited diplomats to a New York U2 concert in 2018 while Canada arranged a similar Celine Dion concert this year. This is the second time in a row that Canada has lost its bid for a seat at the UN's top table. This infographic shows the non-permanent UN Security Council members with the most terms since 1946 based on UN data.

(Tom Brenner/The New York Times) A look back at how the UNSC has changed over time reveals that the UNSC’s sole formal reform didn’t dilute the P5’s formal powers, but still produced a real shift in the UNSC’s work and practices: it gave other member states — particularly the UNSC’s rotating 10 elected members — new ways to slowly transform both the form and substance of international peace and security. Examining these changes highlights how this vital institution can change even when its powerful members are reluctant to give up their political advantages.

The council is also responsible for overseeing the complex and dangerous work of the UN’s more than two dozen peacekeeping and political missions.

It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of 'Halloween Town', who stumbles upon 'Christmas Town' and schemes to take over the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix, and Ed Ivory. The Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the critical success of Vincent that same year, Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film or a half-hour television special, to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label because the studio believed the film would be 'too dark and scary for kids'. The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film, but lost to Jurassic Park. The film has been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010. In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.' Plot "", ""Ed Ivory as Santa Claus, the ruler of Christmas Town. Santa is responsible for the annual celebration of Christmas, in which he delivers presents to children in the real world. He is also referred to by Jack and Halloween Town's residents as 'Sandy Claws.' Ivory also provides the brief narration at the start of the film. Joe Ranft as Igor, one of Dr Finkelstein's creations and his lab assistant. Paul Reubens as Lock, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie. Reubens and Burton had previously worked on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Batman Returns. The cast also features Kerry Katz, Carmen Twillie, Randy Crenshaw, Lisa Donovan Lukas, Debi Durst, Glenn Walters, Sherwood Ball, John Morris and Greg Proops voicing various characters. Patrick Stewart recorded narration for a prologue and epilogue. While not used in the final film, the narration is included on the soundtrack album. Production Development Director Henry Selick and producer/creator Tim Burton. As writer Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. 'Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, […] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before,' Burton would later recall. After completing his short film Vincent in 1982, Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas. Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, but also considered other options such as a children's book. He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models; Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time. After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special. However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed 'too weird' to the company. As Disney was unable to 'offer his nocturnal loners enough scope', Burton was fired from the studio in 1984 and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989) for Warner Bros. Pictures. "", ""Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California, with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming. Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation. At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming. In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book. In addition, Selick stated, 'When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.' Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory. Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film's soundtrack. "", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally going to be released under Walt Disney Pictures as part of the Walt Disney Feature Animation lineup, but Disney decided to release the film under the studio's adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures banner, because the studio thought the film would be 'too dark and scary for kids,' Selick remembered. 'Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.' To convey Burton's involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that, '…it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about.'

James Berardinelli stated 'The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance.

The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was enacted by Congress in June 1933 and was one of the measures by which President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to assist the nation's economic recovery during the Great Depression. The passage of NIRA ushered in a unique experiment in U.S. economic history – the NIRA sanctioned, supported, and in some cases, enforced an alliance of industries. Antitrust laws were suspended, and companies were required to write industry-wide 'codes of fair competition' that effectively fixed prices and wages, established production quotas, and imposed restrictions on entry of other companies into the alliances. The act further called for industrial self-regulation and declared that codes of fair competition – for the protection of consumers, competitors, and employers – were to be drafted for the various industries of the country and were to be subject to public hearings. Employees were given the right to organize and bargain collectively and could not be required, as a condition of employment, to join or refrain from joining a labor organization. The National Recovery Administration (NRA), created by a separate executive order, was put into operation soon after the final approval of the act. \x1b[102m[1] President Roosevelt appointed Hugh S. Johnson as administrator for industrial recovery\x1b[0m. The administration was empowered to make voluntary agreements dealing with hours of work, rates of pay, and the fixing of prices. "", ""https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/dolchp03\nBy the time Perkins came to the Department of Labor in 1933 the economy had virtually collapsed. An estimated 13 million people were unemployed and hundreds of thousands had become homeless wanderers in search of work. The nation's industrial production had fallen by 44 percent since 1929. Millions of farmers faced foreclosure. Banks were failing by the score. Local governments were running out of money for relief programs. President Roosevelt's approach to the problem was both conservative and innovative. He spurned both the economic orthodoxy of the Hoover Administration and the wishes of many to see drastic, dictatorial action. He surrounded himself with able, creative minds and set out on a flexible and humane program to get the country back on its feet. "", ""https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/who-we-are/our-history/1933-the-nlb-and-the-old-nlrb\nThe renewed interest in organizing, together with the refusal of many employers to recognize the unions their employees wanted, triggered strikes in support of the organizing drives. By August 1933, the situation had become so severe that President Franklin Roosevelt created a National Labor Board (NLB) to bring about compliance with Section 7(a) and to mediate labor disputes. He made Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York its chairman. Three industry representatives were selected for the NLB by the National Recovery Administration's Industry Advisory Board, and three labor members were picked by the NRA's Labor Advisory Board. In early 1934, President Roosevelt authorized the NLB to conduct union representation elections and handle violations of the NIRA codes.

Influenza C Influenza viruses infect both humans and pigs, but do not infect birds. Transmission between pigs and humans have occurred in the past. For example, influenza C caused small outbreaks of a mild form of influenza amongst children in Japan and California.

However, direct transmission from pigs to humans is rare, with only 12 recorded cases in the U.S. since 2005. Nevertheless, the retention of influenza strains in pigs after these strains have disappeared from the human population might make pigs a reservoir where influenza viruses could persist, later emerging to reinfect humans once human immunity to these strains has waned. ', ""See More See Less About Avian InfluenzaAvian influenza is caused by influenza Type A virus (influenza A). Avian-origin influenza viruses are broadly categorized based on a combination of two groups of proteins on the surface of the influenza A virus: hemagglutinin or 'H' proteins, of which there are 16 (H1–H16), and neuraminidase or 'N' proteins, of which there are 9 (N1–N9). Many different combinations of 'H' and 'N' proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype, and related viruses within a subtype may be referred to as a lineage. Avian influenza viruses are classified as either 'low pathogenic' or 'highly pathogenic' based on their genetic features and the severity of the disease they cause in poultry.

Clement, a founder of the state branch of the Daughters of the Confederacy. The official design of the flag of Oklahoma has remained the same since 1941, however, unauthorized flag designs became prevalent throughout the state, so much so that the correct and official design of the flag was becoming lost. These unauthorized flags displayed stylized eagle feathers, incorrectly shaped crosses, an incorrectly shaped pipe, wrong colors, or combinations of these and other errors. In 2005, an Oklahoma Boy Scout leader designing patches for a National Jamboree contingent was looking for an image of the Oklahoma state flag and noticed that there were multiple unauthorized designs of the Oklahoma state flag displayed on state government, historical, and educational websites. With some research he was able to identify the official design to use, but because of the prevalence of unauthorized designs, he contacted his state representative, and was the impetus to standardize the colors and shapes by Oklahoma Senate Bill 1359 and signed into law by Governor Brad Henry on May 23, 2006, taking effect on November 1, 2006.

Date: December 6, 2018Author: Bhanu Dhamija It is commonly believed that B.R. Ambedkar framed the Indian Constitution. Many think he did so single-handedly. But like any other constitution, ours wasn’t created by any single person. It was formulated in a number of Committees and then debated and decided inside the Constituent Assembly. However, there is a reason why Ambedkar is usually given all the credit. He was a popular leader of the Dalits (people of scheduled castes) who constitute about 16% of India’s population today. That is a big vote bank. For decades, those who wish to get the Dalit vote have been feigning Ambedkar-worship by singing paeans to his constitutional contributions. No doubt, Ambedkar was a key member of the Constituent Assembly. He sat in some of its topmost committees, such as the Union Constitution Committee chaired by Jawaharlal Nehru. Ambedkar also led the Drafting Committee which scrutinized the original draft prepared by the Constitutional Advisor, B.N. Rau. Shepherding the final draft through the Assembly was a major accomplishment indeed, where Ambedkar made some of his finest speeches. But the real architect of India’s Constitution was Jawaharlal Nehru. His Union Constitution Committee had 15 members including Ambedkar. Almost all key principles of the Constitution were decided by this Committee, and only then brought to the floor of the Assembly. And since the Assembly was in total control of the Congress party of which Nehru was the indisputable leader, the Committee decisions were almost always approved. So much so that in the case of deciding how the President of the country ought to be elected, Nehru’s wish prevailed over all others inside the Assembly. He wanted the President to be elected indirectly by the MPs and MLAs sitting in the country’s legislatures. In a joint meeting in June 1947 of the Assembly’s 36 topmost framers, Nehru was asked to reconsider. But he never did.  Today, India’s President, the head of government, is not elected directly by the people. In the following article, one of India’s leading constitutional scholars, Sudheendra Kulkarni chronicles the roles of Ambedkar and Nehru in the making of India’s Constitution. -Bhanu Dhamija Follow @BhanuDhamija * [Excerpts of Kulkarni’s article first published in The Herald} Nehru Stands Above Ambedkar in the Writing of India’s Constitution By Sudheendra Kulkarni "", 'Indeed, as the head of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution, he certainly stands tall among the luminaries who were part of the Constituent Assembly.

The battles started on Lexington Green and then moved to Concord Village. Listen, my children, and you shall hear Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five: "", ""The Battle of Concord The British then went to search for guns in Concord. It was already 8 am. British commanders Francis Smith and John Pitcairn ordered 220 people to take the North Bridge across the Concord River. They then continued on another mile to Barrett Farm, where they found weapons and powder. The British didn’t know that most of the guns had been moved, so they burned what they found.  Some people from Concord and the towns around got together on a high hill. They saw smoke coming out of Concord.  They thought that British soldiers were burning down the town. Captain Davis the first to confront them by saying, 'I don’t have any men who are afraid.' When Davis’s company came close to the British, they started firing and killed Davis. The colonists fired back, killing three British soldiers and wounding nine others.  This is considered the shot heard round the world that caused the redcoats to retreat into town. The 'shot heard round the world' Someone then shot what was called the 'shot heard round the world'. It was called like that in a famous poem written by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

They were fought in two towns outside Boston, Massachusetts: Lexington, Massachusetts and Concord, Massachusetts. The Patriots found out long before that could happen, and they safely evacuated the place. "", 'In this first battle of the American Revolution, Massachusetts colonists defied British authority, outnumbered and outfought the Redcoats, and embarked on a lengthy war to earn their independence.How It EndedAmerican victory. The British marched into Lexington and Concord intending to suppress the possibility of rebellion by seizing weapons from the colonists. Instead, their actions sparked the first battle of the Revolutionary War. The colonists’ intricate alarm system summoned local militia companies, enabling them to successfully counter the British threat.In ContextThomas Gage was appointed Royal Governor of Massachusetts in 1774 and tasked by the British Parliament with stamping out rising unrest caused by restrictive British policies. Gage inflamed tensions between the colonies and the mother country and practiced harsh enforcement of British law. He drafted the Coercive Acts, a series of laws intended to punish colonists for deeds of defiance against the King, such as the Boston Tea Party.By April 1775, Gage was facing the threat of outright rebellion. He hoped to prevent violence by ordering the seizure of weapons and powder being stored in Concord, Massachusetts, twenty miles northwest of Boston. But he underestimated the courage and determination of the colonists. Patriot spies got wind of Gage’s plan. On the evening of April 18, Paul Revere and other riders raised the alarm that British regulars were on their way to Concord. Minute Men and militias rushed to confront them early on April 19. Though it is uncertain who actually fired the first shot that day, it reverberated throughout history. Eight years of war followed, and those who stood their ground against Gage’s troops eventually earned independence from Britain and became citizens of the democratic United States of America. ', ""At dawn on April 19, the troops reached the town of Lexington, five miles east of Concord. About seventy volunteer soldiers called minutemen lined the Lexington Green to warn the redcoated British troops not to trespass ont he property of freeborn English subjects. A shot rang out; the British troops fired. Eight minutemen were killed and another ten were wounded. The British continued to Concord, where they searched for hidden arms. At North Bridge, a group of redcoats and minutemen clashed, leaving 3 redcoats and 2 minutemen dead. The British then retreated to Boston, while citizen-soldiers fired at the soldiers from behind trees and stone fences. British solders killed or wounded totalled 273; colonists losses were 95. The resistance displayed on April 19, 1775 indicated that the American Revolution would truly be a popular revolution. The battles of Lexington and Concord occurred three weeks after Patrick Henry (1736-1799) delivered his famous words, 'Give me liberty or give me death.' Although an earlier battle with the British had been fought in North Carolina, at Moore's Creek Bridge, Lexington and Concord became fixed in the public mind as the valiant start of American resistance. Several first-person accounts of these battles survive. Phineas Fullam, a Committee of Safety postrider, reported seeing 'some of the Men killed the whole number on both sides as near as can be estimated is 200 among whom are a Considerable Number of Regular Officers.' Colonel Isaac Merrill, who mobilized the Amesbury militia, offered the following description of one of the Revolution's opening clashes. Document: "", ""By April 1775, reconciliation between England and the thirteen colonies had failed. Two months earlier, Parliament had declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion, and on April 14 General Thomas Gage received secret orders from England to suppress the rebels. On the night of April 18, Gage sent 700 British soldiers to Concord to seize patriot supplies there. At dawn the British reached the town of Lexington, just east of Concord, where they found seventy American militiamen waiting for them on the village green. Warned of the British troops’ movements, the Lexington patriots had assembled in an effort to halt British progress toward Concord. Both sides stood their ground, and in a tense moment, a shot was fired. Though it’s unclear which side, British soldier or American patriot, fired that first 'shot heard ’round the world,' history remembers it as the start of the American Revolutionary War. "", 'Battle of Lexington and Concord: CausesThe First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in September of 1774 in response to the Intolerable Acts passed as punishment for the city of Boston. This group of colonial delegates debated the proper course of action against the British in retaliation for these acts. Along with a Declaration of Rights and Grievances, one of the outcomes of the Congress was a suggestion of preparing colonial militias. Over the coming months, Committees of Observance, whose purpose was to ensure colonies were collectively boycotting British goods, also began to oversee the creation of these militia forces and the stockpiling of weapons and ammunition. Outside the city of Boston, which was under heavy patrol of a British garrison under the command of General Thomas Gage, the militia stockpiled weapons in the town of Concord, approximately 18 miles from the city.Battle of Lexington and Concord: Summary ', 'Battle of Lexington and Concord: CausesThe First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in September of 1774 in response to the Intolerable Acts passed as punishment for the city of Boston.

They marked the outbreak of armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and Patriot militias from America's thirteen colonies. In late 1774, Colonial leaders adopted the Suffolk Resolves in resistance to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party. The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities. The Colonial government effectively controlled the colony outside of British-controlled Boston. In response, the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion.

The colonists built an alarm system to warn them if the British were coming. The British army was coming to get guns from Massachusetts, but colonists knew so they started fighting with British soldiers. The battles started on Lexington Green and then moved to Concord Village. Listen, my children, and you shall hear Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five: "", ""https://historyforkids.org/battles-of-lexington-and-concord/\nThe Battle of Concord The British then went to search for guns in Concord. It was already 8 am. British commanders Francis Smith and John Pitcairn ordered 220 people to take the North Bridge across the Concord River. They then continued on another mile to Barrett Farm, where they found weapons and powder. The British didn’t know that most of the guns had been moved, so they burned what they found.  Some people from Concord and the towns around got together on a high hill. They saw smoke coming out of Concord.  They thought that British soldiers were burning down the town. Captain Davis the first to confront them by saying, 'I don’t have any men who are afraid.' When Davis’s company came close to the British, they started firing and killed Davis. The colonists fired back, killing three British soldiers and wounding nine others.  This is considered the shot heard round the world that caused the redcoats to retreat into town. The 'shot heard round the world' Someone then shot what was called the 'shot heard round the world'. It was called like that in a famous poem written by Ralph Waldo Emerson. This is the beginning of the poem: "", ""https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationCite this pageGet shortened URLDownload QR codeWikidata item Print/export Make a bookDownload as PDFPage for printing In other projects Wikimedia Commons Appearance move to sidebar hide From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The Battles of Lexington and Concord were the first battles of the American Revolutionary War.[1] The battles were between British soldiers, who wanted to take away the colonists' weapons and to arrest John Hancock and Samuel Adams on the way to Concord, and American colonists on April 19, 1775. They were fought in two towns outside Boston, Massachusetts: Lexington, Massachusetts and Concord, Massachusetts. The Patriots found out long before that could happen, and they safely evacuated the place. "", 'https://www.battlefields.org/learn/revolutionary-war/battles/lexington-and-concord\nIn this first battle of the American Revolution, Massachusetts colonists defied British authority, outnumbered and outfought the Redcoats, and embarked on a lengthy war to earn their independence.How It EndedAmerican victory. The British marched into Lexington and Concord intending to suppress the possibility of rebellion by seizing weapons from the colonists. Instead, their actions sparked the first battle of the Revolutionary War. The colonists’ intricate alarm system summoned local militia companies, enabling them to successfully counter the British threat.In ContextThomas Gage was appointed Royal Governor of Massachusetts in 1774 and tasked by the British Parliament with stamping out rising unrest caused by restrictive British policies. Gage inflamed tensions between the colonies and the mother country and practiced harsh enforcement of British law. He drafted the Coercive Acts, a series of laws intended to punish colonists for deeds of defiance against the King, such as the Boston Tea Party.By April 1775, Gage was facing the threat of outright rebellion. He hoped to prevent violence by ordering the seizure of weapons and powder being stored in Concord, Massachusetts, twenty miles northwest of Boston. But he underestimated the courage and determination of the colonists. Patriot spies got wind of Gage’s plan. On the evening of April 18, Paul Revere and other riders raised the alarm that British regulars were on their way to Concord. Minute Men and militias rushed to confront them early on April 19. Though it is uncertain who actually fired the first shot that day, it reverberated throughout history. Eight years of war followed, and those who stood their ground against Gage’s troops eventually earned independence from Britain and became citizens of the democratic United States of America. ', ""https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&psid=129\nAt dawn on April 19, the troops reached the town of Lexington, five miles east of Concord. About seventy volunteer soldiers called minutemen lined the Lexington Green to warn the redcoated British troops not to trespass ont he property of freeborn English subjects. A shot rang out; the British troops fired. Eight minutemen were killed and another ten were wounded. The British continued to Concord, where they searched for hidden arms. At North Bridge, a group of redcoats and minutemen clashed, leaving 3 redcoats and 2 minutemen dead. The British then retreated to Boston, while citizen-soldiers fired at the soldiers from behind trees and stone fences. British solders killed or wounded totalled 273; colonists losses were 95. The resistance displayed on April 19, 1775 indicated that the American Revolution would truly be a popular revolution. The battles of Lexington and Concord occurred three weeks after Patrick Henry (1736-1799) delivered his famous words, 'Give me liberty or give me death.' Although an earlier battle with the British had been fought in North Carolina, at Moore's Creek Bridge, Lexington and Concord became fixed in the public mind as the valiant start of American resistance. Several first-person accounts of these battles survive. Phineas Fullam, a Committee of Safety postrider, reported seeing 'some of the Men killed the whole number on both sides as near as can be estimated is 200 among whom are a Considerable Number of Regular Officers.' Colonel Isaac Merrill, who mobilized the Amesbury militia, offered the following description of one of the Revolution's opening clashes. Document: "", ""https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/spotlight-primary-source/battles-lexington-and-concord-1775\nBy April 1775, reconciliation between England and the thirteen colonies had failed. Two months earlier, Parliament had declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion, and on April 14 General Thomas Gage received secret orders from England to suppress the rebels. On the night of April 18, Gage sent 700 British soldiers to Concord to seize patriot supplies there. At dawn the British reached the town of Lexington, just east of Concord, where they found seventy American militiamen waiting for them on the village green. Warned of the British troops’ movements, the Lexington patriots had assembled in an effort to halt British progress toward Concord. Both sides stood their ground, and in a tense moment, a shot was fired. Though it’s unclear which side, British soldier or American patriot, fired that first 'shot heard ’round the world,' history remembers it as the start of the American Revolutionary War.

85,457,"[""https://darlingaxe.com/blogs/news/story-skeleton-anne-of-green-gables\nStory structure is essential to the psychological appeal of a narrative. It engages readers, builds anticipation, and creates a desire to know what happens next. This blog post aims to demonstrate the creative universality of story structure with a plot analysis of the classic novel Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery. By David G Brown \x1b[92m[1] Anne of Green Gables tells the story of a young orphan girl named Anne Shirley who is mistakenly sent to live with a pair of elderly siblings, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, on Prince Edward Island\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Despite Marilla’s initial reluctance to keep her, Anne's charm, intelligence, and imaginative spirit soon win over their hearts and those of the entire community\x1b[0m. Coming of Age A coming-of-age narrative, also known as a bildungsroman, is often structured differently than most novels. The overall trajectory involves the character growing up through a series of formative experiences, but if we dig into the different relationship threads, it’s usually possible to find the one goal that forms the story’s backbone. To put that another way, the primary narrative goal is an arrow fired in the inciting incident which will hit a target in the climax. However, in a coming-of-age story, that goal isn’t necessarily something the protagonist pursues on every page. Anne of Green Gables offers many episodic threads that work together to deeply characterize herself, her adoptive parents, and many of the other residents of Avonlea. There is one thread, however, that directly connects the inciting incident with the climax: her relationship with Matthew. Narrative Goal \x1b[92m[3] Anne’s narrative journey is primarily relational—she wants to be accepted and loved, but she also has an irrepressible desire to speak her mind and express herself\x1b[0m. Therefore, the plot grows out of several relationship threads in which Anne strives for love and acceptance. Her obstacles include the town’s initial prejudices toward orphans and Anne’s blunt tongue and temper. Anne’s narrative goal crystalizes in her cart ride from the train station to her new home in Avonlea—a scene in which it’s clear Anne and Matthew have an instant bond. Quite simply, Anne’s goal is that she doesn’t want to lose Matthew. Plot Points Stasis Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, aging and unmarried siblings, decide to adopt a boy to help them around the farm. Anne is an orphan and has been moving from one foster home to another before she is sent by mistake to the Green Gables farm in Avonlea. Inciting incident Since the primary trajectory grows out of Anne’s desire to become Matthew’s adopted daughter, \x1b[92m[4] the point of no return is when Matthew confesses to Marilla that he doesn’t mind that they were sent a girl in error—he likes Anne and would like to keep her\x1b[0m. There is no returning from this declaration of affection. With their bond established, the stakes are set. The reader knows exactly what they both stand to lose—each other. Rising action?! Anne of Green Gables has an unusual story shape not only because it’s a coming-of-age narrative but also because it’s a tragedy. So while there is episodic rising action as Anne moves through various challenges, conflicts, and learning experiences, there is also an easing of tension as the original threat—that she might be sent back to the orphanage—fades from possibility. "", ""https://www.mtishows.com/anne-of-green-gables\nAnne of Green GablesOriginal Off-Broadway Version (2007)Anne of Green Gables follows the misadventures of a wildly independent orphan with fiery red hair and a temper to match.

It engages readers, builds anticipation, and creates a desire to know what happens next. This blog post aims to demonstrate the creative universality of story structure with a plot analysis of the classic novel Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery. By David G Brown Anne of Green Gables tells the story of a young orphan girl named Anne Shirley who is mistakenly sent to live with a pair of elderly siblings, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, on Prince Edward Island. Despite Marilla’s initial reluctance to keep her, Anne's charm, intelligence, and imaginative spirit soon win over their hearts and those of the entire community. Coming of Age A coming-of-age narrative, also known as a bildungsroman, is often structured differently than most novels. The overall trajectory involves the character growing up through a series of formative experiences, but if we dig into the different relationship threads, it’s usually possible to find the one goal that forms the story’s backbone. To put that another way, the primary narrative goal is an arrow fired in the inciting incident which will hit a target in the climax. However, in a coming-of-age story, that goal isn’t necessarily something the protagonist pursues on every page. Anne of Green Gables offers many episodic threads that work together to deeply characterize herself, her adoptive parents, and many of the other residents of Avonlea. There is one thread, however, that directly connects the inciting incident with the climax: her relationship with Matthew. Narrative Goal Anne’s narrative journey is primarily relational—she wants to be accepted and loved, but she also has an irrepressible desire to speak her mind and express herself. Therefore, the plot grows out of several relationship threads in which Anne strives for love and acceptance. Her obstacles include the town’s initial prejudices toward orphans and Anne’s blunt tongue and temper. Anne’s narrative goal crystalizes in her cart ride from the train station to her new home in Avonlea—a scene in which it’s clear Anne and Matthew have an instant bond. Quite simply, Anne’s goal is that she doesn’t want to lose Matthew. Plot Points Stasis Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, aging and unmarried siblings, decide to adopt a boy to help them around the farm. Anne is an orphan and has been moving from one foster home to another before she is sent by mistake to the Green Gables farm in Avonlea. Inciting incident Since the primary trajectory grows out of Anne’s desire to become Matthew’s adopted daughter, the point of no return is when Matthew confesses to Marilla that he doesn’t mind that they were sent a girl in error—he likes Anne and would like to keep her. There is no returning from this declaration of affection. With their bond established, the stakes are set. The reader knows exactly what they both stand to lose—each other. Rising action?! Anne of Green Gables has an unusual story shape not only because it’s a coming-of-age narrative but also because it’s a tragedy. So while there is episodic rising action as Anne moves through various challenges, conflicts, and learning experiences, there is also an easing of tension as the original threat—that she might be sent back to the orphanage—fades from possibility. "", ""Anne of Green Gables is a 1908 novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery (published as L. M. Montgomery). Written for all ages, it has been considered a classic children's novel since the mid-20th century. Set in the late 19th century, the novel recounts the adventures of 11-year-old orphan girl Anne Shirley sent by mistake to two middle-aged siblings, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, who had originally intended to adopt a boy to help them on their farm in the fictional town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The novel recounts how Anne makes her way through life with the Cuthberts, in school, and within the town. Since its publication, Anne of Green Gables has been translated into at least 36 languages and has sold more than 50 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books worldwide. It was the first of many novels; Montgomery wrote numerous sequels, and since her death another sequel has been published, as well as an authorized prequel titled Before Green Gables. This prequel was written in 2008 by Budge Wilson to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the book series. The original book is taught to students around the world. The book has been adapted as films, television films, and animated and live-action television series. Musicals and plays have also been created, with productions annually in Canada, Europe and Japan. Background The portrait of Evelyn Nesbit by Rudolf Eickemeyer Jr. which inspired Montgomery In writing the novel, Montgomery was inspired by notes she had made as a young girl about two siblings who were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of the boy they had requested, yet decided to keep her. She drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island, Canada. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New York's Metropolitan Magazine and put on the wall of her bedroom as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her 'youthful idealism and spirituality.' Montgomery was inspired by the 'formula Ann' orphan stories (called such because they followed such a predictable formula) that were popular at the time, but distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra 'e'. She based other characters, such as Gilbert Blythe, in part on people she knew. She said she wrote the novel in the twilight of the day, while sitting at her window and overlooking the fields of Cavendish.

It possesses a constant radius of curvature (In the context of spherical mirrors, the radius of curvature refers to the distance between the centre of the spherical mirror and its curved surface.). Spherical mirrors can create both real and virtual images, depending on the position of the object and the mirror. Spherical mirrors are further categorized into concave and convex mirrors, each with distinct properties and image formation characteristics. In the upcoming sections, we will detail the characteristics of convex and concave mirrors, along with a comprehensive understanding of the images formed by these mirrors when the object is placed at various positions with the help of ray diagrams. Characteristics of Concave and Convex Mirrors Concave Mirror Definition A concave mirror \x1b[92m[1] is a curved mirror where the reflecting surface is on the inner side of the curved shape\x1b[0m. It has a surface that curves inward, resembling the shape of the inner surface of a hollow sphere. Concave mirrors are also converging mirrors because they cause light rays to converge or come together after reflection. Depending on the position of the object and the mirror, concave mirrors \x1b[92m[2] can form both real and virtual images\x1b[0m. Characteristics of Concave Mirrors Converging Mirror: A concave mirror is often referred to as a converging mirror because when light rays strike and reflect from its reflecting surface, they converge or come together at a specific point known as the focal point. This property of concave mirrors allows them to focus light to a point. Magnification and Image Formation: When a concave mirror is placed very close to the object, it forms a magnified, erect, and virtual image. The image appears larger than the actual object and is upright. The virtual image is formed as the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point behind the mirror. Changing Distance and Image Properties: As the distance between the object and the concave mirror increases, the size of the image decreases. Eventually, at a certain distance, the image transitions from virtual to real. In this case, a real and inverted image is formed on the opposite side of the mirror. Versatile Image Formation: Concave mirrors have the ability to create images that can vary in size, from small to large, and in nature, from real to virtual. These characteristics make concave mirrors useful in various applications such as telescopes, shaving mirrors, and reflecting headlights. Convex Mirror Definition ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_image\nFor a (refracting) lens, the real image of an object is formed on the opposite side of the lens while the virtual image is formed on the same side as the object. For a (reflecting) mirror, the real image is on the same side as the object while the virtual image is on the opposite side of, or 'behind', the mirror. In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays (forming virtual images) are conventionally represented by dotted lines, to contrast with the solid lines of real rays. Because the rays never really converge, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen by putting it at the location of the virtual image. In contrast, a real image can be projected on the screen as it is \x1b[95m[3] formed by rays that converge on a real location\x1b[0m. A real image can be projected onto a diffusely reflecting screen so people can see the image (the image on the screen plays as an object to be imaged by human eyes).

The image appears upright, smaller than the actual object, and behind the mirror. When traced backwards, the virtual image is formed by the apparent intersection of diverging rays. Wide Field of View: One of the significant characteristics of convex mirrors is their ability to provide a wide field of view. Due to the outwardly curved shape, convex mirrors can reflect a broader area compared to flat or concave mirrors.

For any object placed on the far side of the focal point with respect to the mirror, the rays converge in front of the mirror to form a real image, which can be projected onto a surface, such as a screen or sheet of paper However, for an object located inside the focal point with respect to the concave mirror, the image is virtual. For a convex mirror the image is always virtual—that is, it appears to be behind the mirror. The ray diagrams in Figure 16.10 show how to determine the nature of the image formed by concave and convex mirrors. Figure 16.10 ', ""Using a concave mirror, you look at the reflection of a faraway object. The image size changes if you move the object closer to the mirror. Why does the image disappear entirely when the object is at the mirror's focal point? The height of the image became infinite. The height of the object became zero. The intensity of intersecting light rays became zero. The intensity of intersecting light rays increased. The Application of the Curved Mirror Equations The Application of the Curved Mirror Equations Curved mirrors and the images they create involve a fairly small number of variables: the mirror’s radius of curvature, R; the focal length, f; the distances of the object and image from the mirror, do and di, respectively; and the heights of the object and image, ho and hi, respectively. The signs of these values indicate whether the image is inverted, erect (upright), real, or virtual. We now look at the equations that relate these variables and apply them to everyday problems. "", ""A concave mirror can't form an enlarged real image. Real images in concave mirrors get smaller as the object moves away from the mirror. Hence, a concave mirror cannot produce an enlarged real image. It can only produce a reduced real image. 04 Analyzing a Concave Mirror Creating an Enlarged Virtual Image An enlarged virtual image is formed when an object is placed between the focal point and the mirror in a concave mirror. It is magnified and appears upright, on the same side as the object. The virtual image appears behind the mirror, while the object is in front. This is why makeup mirrors, which are concave, make the face appear larger than it actually is. Key Concepts These are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question. Reduced Real Image Understanding how a concave mirror forms a reduced real image is essential when studying optics. Essentially, a real image is formed when reflected light rays converge at a point to produce an image that can be projected on a screen. In the case of a reduced real image, the object must be positioned beyond the center of curvature (C) of the concave mirror. The image will be formed between C and the focal point (F), appearing reduced in size and inverted.In practical terms, this means that if you were to place an object, like a candle, at a distance greater than the mirror's radius of curvature, the image reflected back would be smaller compared to the object itself. This principle is used in various optical instruments, such as telescopes and cameras, to capture details of distant objects. By adjusting the distance between the object and the mirror, one can precisely control the size of the image produced. Virtual Image Magnification Virtual images produced by concave mirrors are a bit different from their real counterparts. A virtual image occurs when the object is within the focal length of the mirror, specifically between the focal point (F) and the mirror itself. Unlike a real image, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen because the light rays do not actually meet but appear to diverge from a common point.With magnification, the virtual image is larger than the object, and it appears upright. This phenomenon can be witnessed when using a shaving or makeup mirror, where the magnified image allows for a close-up view of the face. The level of magnification can be quite significant, making detailed tasks easier. To understand why the image is magnified, consider that a virtual image's size depends on the angle at which the light rays appear to be coming from; closer placement to the mirror results in a wider angle and thus, a larger image.

It possesses a constant radius of curvature (In the context of spherical mirrors, the radius of curvature refers to the distance between the centre of the spherical mirror and its curved surface.). Spherical mirrors can create both real and virtual images, depending on the position of the object and the mirror. Spherical mirrors are further categorized into concave and convex mirrors, each with distinct properties and image formation characteristics. In the upcoming sections, we will detail the characteristics of convex and concave mirrors, along with a comprehensive understanding of the images formed by these mirrors when the object is placed at various positions with the help of ray diagrams. Characteristics of Concave and Convex Mirrors Concave Mirror Definition A concave mirror \x1b[92m[1] is a curved mirror where the reflecting surface is on the inner side of the curved shape\x1b[0m. It has a surface that curves inward, resembling the shape of the inner surface of a hollow sphere. Concave mirrors are also converging mirrors because they cause light rays to converge or come together after reflection. Depending on the position of the object and the mirror, concave mirrors \x1b[92m[2] can form both real and virtual images\x1b[0m. Characteristics of Concave Mirrors Converging Mirror: A concave mirror is often referred to as a converging mirror because when light rays strike and reflect from its reflecting surface, they converge or come together at a specific point known as the focal point. This property of concave mirrors allows them to focus light to a point. Magnification and Image Formation: When a concave mirror is placed very close to the object, it forms a magnified, erect, and virtual image. The image appears larger than the actual object and is upright. The virtual image is formed as the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point behind the mirror. Changing Distance and Image Properties: As the distance between the object and the concave mirror increases, the size of the image decreases. Eventually, at a certain distance, the image transitions from virtual to real. In this case, a real and inverted image is formed on the opposite side of the mirror. Versatile Image Formation: Concave mirrors have the ability to create images that can vary in size, from small to large, and in nature, from real to virtual. These characteristics make concave mirrors useful in various applications such as telescopes, shaving mirrors, and reflecting headlights. Convex Mirror Definition ', 'https://byjus.com/physics/concave-convex-mirrors/\nVirtual, Erect, and Diminished Images: Regardless of the distance between the object and the convex mirror, the images formed are always virtual, erect, and diminished. The image appears upright, smaller than the actual object, and behind the mirror. When traced backwards, the virtual image is formed by the apparent intersection of diverging rays. Wide Field of View: One of the significant characteristics of convex mirrors is their ability to provide a wide field of view. Due to the outwardly curved shape, convex mirrors can reflect a broader area compared to flat or concave mirrors. This property makes them useful when a larger perspective is required, such as in parking lots, intersections, or surveillance systems. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_image\nFor a (refracting) lens, the real image of an object is formed on the opposite side of the lens while the virtual image is formed on the same side as the object. For a (reflecting) mirror, the real image is on the same side as the object while the virtual image is on the opposite side of, or 'behind', the mirror. In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays (forming virtual images) are conventionally represented by dotted lines, to contrast with the solid lines of real rays. Because the rays never really converge, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen by putting it at the location of the virtual image. In contrast, a real image can be projected on the screen as it is \x1b[95m[3] formed by rays that converge on a real location\x1b[0m. A real image can be projected onto a diffusely reflecting screen so people can see the image (the image on the screen plays as an object to be imaged by human eyes). "", 'https://www.texasgateway.org/resource/161-reflection\n(a, b) The focal length for the concave mirror in (a), formed by converging rays, is in front of the mirror, and has a positive value. The focal length for the convex mirror in (b), formed by diverging rays, appears to be behind the mirror, and has a negative value. Images formed by a concave mirror vary, depending on which side of the focal point the object is placed. For any object placed on the far side of the focal point with respect to the mirror, the rays \x1b[1;31;60m[6] converge in front of the mirror to form a real image, which can be projected onto a surface, such as a screen or sheet of paper\x1b[0m However, for an object located inside the focal point with respect to the concave mirror, the image is virtual.

', 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is – or was for me – an incredibly moving and powerfully affecting film. It manages to make you feel how utterly evil Evil is. It also makes you feel how important and valuable every single human life is, and how tragic and terrible is its loss. The story centres on a German family – father, mother, young teenage daughter and most of all their 8-year-old son Bruno – during the Second World War. Bruno’s father is a soldier, and at the start of the film he has just been promoted, meaning that the whole family must move to a new house in the country.

And in the process how those doing the brutalising paradoxically become brutalised and dehumanised themselves. Humanity and the value of human life Conversely, the film shows up the potential goodness of humanity and the human spirit in stark contrast to the inhumanity and brutality to which other humans are subjecting it. It shows that, while the brutalisers become increasingly brutish, those who are being treated brutally can choose to retain their humanity and dignity in the face of everything. ', ""The Boy with the Striped Pyjamas is largely told from the perspective of a child, which is to say that it casts a familiar and much examined world into a twilight of the uncanny—the known revisited as the hazily uncharted in the act of exploration. The Boy is about as un-Hollywood in its exploration of childhood and fascism as Pan’s Labyrinth—and similarly gruesome. In its final scenes, in which terrified parents run through the woods in search of their son, it resembles the horror of a Grimm’s tale before Disney got his fingers on it. The Boy is uncompromisingly bleak. The title character, as you might have guessed, is a Jewish child in a Nazi concentration camp. As I was reminded on a recent visit to Riga, Latvia, the camp uniform does indeed resemble old-fashioned sleep ware, a comparison all the more poignant if we consider that the camps were the final resting place for most of its inmates. The central character, though, is the son of a Nazi officer. Eight years old, he is unaware of what is going on beyond the walls of his austere new home, the one to which his family moved from Berlin after his father was assigned with the supervision of the nearby concentration camp. To the boy in his cheerless isolation, the camp is farm, a lively community where he might make new friends. Day after day, he ventures through the woods to the electric fence behind which he descries a boy is own age, a fellow whose life seems mysterious and exciting to him. Why should he accept that his new playmate is separated from him? Why not ignore or overcome this barrier? Why not wear 'striped pyjamas' to be just like his new friend? We have the answers to those questions; history provided them, and everyday life often confirms them. We know what happened.

Bruno’s family is very wealthy, and he gets whatever he wants. Bruno’s dad is a commander of the Nazis, and Bruno’s sister, Gretel, is obsessed with dolls and politics. We don’t hear about his mother much through the story; she is, as some would call her, a flat character.

Away from his friends and growing increasingly bored, Bruno ventures outside of his backyard, defying his mother’s (Vera Farmiga) rules, in search of something to do.

Treaties are binding agreements between nations and become part of international law. Treaties to which the United States is a party also have the force of federal legislation, forming part of what the Constitution calls ''the supreme Law of the Land.'' The Senate does not ratify treaties. Following consideration by the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Senate either approves or rejects a resolution of ratification. If the resolution passes, then ratification takes place when the instruments of ratification are formally exchanged between the United States and the foreign power(s). The Senate has considered and approved for ratification all but a small number of treaties negotiated by the president and his representatives. In some cases, when Senate leadership believed a treaty lacked sufficient support for approval, the Senate simply did not vote on the treaty and it was eventually withdrawn by the president. Since pending treaties are not required to be resubmitted at the beginning of each new Congress, they may remain under consideration by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for an extended period of time. In recent decades, presidents have frequently entered the United States into international agreements without the advice and consent of the Senate. These are called 'executive agreements.' Though not brought before the Senate for approval, executive agreements are still binding on the parties under international law.

During the Convention, it was initially contemplated that the U.S. Senate, the newly proposed upper house of Congress, would have the power to make treaties (as well as to appoint ambassadors and judges of the Supreme Court). Just ten days before the Convention adjourned, it was decided that these powers would be shared with the President. Many delegates cited the established international tradition of executives holding exclusive power over foreign relations and agreements; the participation of the Senate through the 'advice and consent' mechanism was added as something of a compromise. "", ""Treaties are comparatively rare in modern U.S. foreign policy. Between 1946 and 1999, the federal government completed nearly 16,000 international agreements, of which only 6% (912) were treaties submitted to the Senate for approval under Article II of the Constitution; most were congressional-executive agreements. Role of Congress Although Article II of the Constitution pertains to the executive branch, the Treaty Clause provides that the power to make treaties is shared between the President and the Senate. However, the clause has never been interpreted as giving the Senate the power or duty to advise the President before a treaty is concluded; in practice, the Senate's authority is limited to either disapproving or approving a treaty, with the latter including the power to attach conditions or reservations. Repeal of treaties "", ""As early as the George Washington administration—the first under the Constitution and therefore the Treaty Clause—presidents have generally not sought the Senate's participation in all stages of treaty-making. Washington had initially consulted the Senate on proposed treaties, but ultimately abandoned the practice after finding it unproductive. The subsequent and widely accepted practice is that the President independently negotiates and signs treaties and then presents the proposed treaty to the Senate for its approval or disapproval. Like Washington, many Presidents have approached the Article II treaty process in different ways. Theodore Roosevelt, whose administration had a robust foreign policy, argued that ratification was necessary where an international accord would bind subsequent governments: "", ""Agreements beyond these competencies must have the approval of Congress (for congressional-executive agreements) or the Senate (for treaties). In 1972, Congress passed legislation requiring the president to notify Congress of any executive agreements that are formed. Although the nondelegation doctrine prevents Congress from delegating its legislative authority to the executive branch, Congress has allowed the executive to act as its 'agent' in trade negotiations, such as by setting tariffs, and, in the case of Trade Promotion Authority, by solely authoring the implementing legislation for trade agreements. The constitutionality of this delegation was upheld by the Supreme Court in Field v. Clark (1892).

During the Convention, it was initially contemplated that the U.S. Senate, the newly proposed upper house of Congress, would have the power to make treaties (as well as to appoint ambassadors and judges of the Supreme Court). Just ten days before the Convention adjourned, it was decided that these powers would be shared with the President. Many delegates cited the established international tradition of executives holding exclusive power over foreign relations and agreements; the participation of the Senate through the 'advice and consent' mechanism was added as something of a compromise. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause\nTreaties are comparatively rare in modern U.S. foreign policy. Between 1946 and 1999, the federal government completed nearly 16,000 international agreements, of which only 6% (912) were treaties submitted to the Senate for approval under Article II of the Constitution; most were congressional-executive agreements. Role of Congress Although Article II of the Constitution pertains to the executive branch, the Treaty Clause provides that the power to make treaties is shared between the President and the Senate. However, the clause has never been interpreted as giving the Senate the power or duty to advise the President before a treaty is concluded; in practice, the Senate's authority is limited to either disapproving or approving a treaty, with the latter including the power to attach conditions or reservations. Repeal of treaties "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause\nAs early as the George Washington administration—the first under the Constitution and therefore the Treaty Clause—presidents have generally not sought the Senate's participation in all stages of treaty-making. Washington had initially consulted the Senate on proposed treaties, but ultimately abandoned the practice after finding it unproductive. The subsequent and widely accepted practice is that the President independently negotiates and signs treaties and then presents the proposed treaty to the Senate for its approval or disapproval. Like Washington, many Presidents have approached the Article II treaty process in different ways. Theodore Roosevelt, whose administration had a robust foreign policy, argued that ratification was necessary where an international accord would bind subsequent governments: "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause\nAgreements beyond these competencies must have the approval of Congress (for congressional-executive agreements) or the Senate (for treaties). In 1972, Congress passed legislation requiring the president to notify Congress of any executive agreements that are formed. Although the nondelegation doctrine prevents Congress from delegating its legislative authority to the executive branch, Congress has allowed the executive to act as its 'agent' in trade negotiations, such as by setting tariffs, and, in the case of Trade Promotion Authority, by solely authoring the implementing legislation for trade agreements. The constitutionality of this delegation was upheld by the Supreme Court in Field v. Clark (1892).

In ancient times, the Tigris nurtured the Assyrian Empire, with remnants like the relief of King Tiglath-Pileser. The Tigris is home to archaeological sites and ancient religious communities, including the Mandaeans, who use it for baptism. Today, the Tigris faces modern threats from geopolitical instability, dam projects, poor water management, and climate change, leading to concerns about its sustainability. Efforts to protect and preserve the river's legacy are ongoing, with local archaeologists and activists working to safeguard its future. Etymology Bedouin crossing the river Tigris with plunder (c.\u20091860) \x1b[1;31;60m[1] The Tigris is 1,750 km (1,090 mi) long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about 25 km (16 mi) southeast of the city of Elazığ and about 30 km (19 mi) from the headwaters of the Euphrates\x1b[0m. \x1b[1;31;60m[2] The river then flows for 400 km (250 mi) through Southeastern Turkey before forming part of the Syria-Turkey border\x1b[0m. \x1b[1;31;60m[3] This stretch of 44 km (27 mi) is the only part of the river that is located in Syria\x1b[0m. Some of its affluences are Garzan, Anbarçayi, Batman, and the Great and the Little Zab. Close to its confluence with the Euphrates, the Tigris splits into several channels. First, the artificial Shatt al-Hayy branches off, to join the Euphrates near Nasiriyah. Second, the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir branch off to feed the Central Marshes. Further downstream, two other distributary channels branch off (the Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla), to feed the Hawizeh Marshes. The main channel continues southwards and is joined by the Al-Kassarah, which drains the Hawizeh Marshes. Finally, the Tigris joins the Euphrates near al-Qurnah to form the Shatt-al-Arab. According to Pliny and other ancient historians, the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris. \x1b[1;31;60m[4] Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, stands on the banks of the Tigris\x1b[0m. The port city of Basra straddles the Shatt al-Arab. In ancient times, many of the great cities of Mesopotamia stood on or near the Tigris, drawing water from it to irrigate the civilization of the Sumerians. Notable Tigris-side cities included Nineveh, Ctesiphon, and Seleucia, while the city of Lagash was irrigated by the Tigris via a canal dug around 2900 B.C. Navigation The Tigris has long been an important transport route in a largely desert country. Shallow-draft vessels can go as far as Baghdad, but rafts have historically been needed for transport downstream from Mosul. Management and water quality Batman River The Tigris is heavily dammed in Iraq and Turkey to provide water for irrigating the arid and semi-desert regions bordering the river valley. Damming has also been important for averting floods in Iraq, to which the Tigris has historically been notoriously prone following April melting of snow in the Turkish mountains. Mosul Dam is the largest dam in Iraq. Recent Turkish damming of the river has been the subject of some controversy, for both its environmental effects within Turkey and its potential to reduce the flow of water downstream. Water from both rivers is used as a means of pressure during conflicts. In 2014 a major breakthrough in developing consensus between multiple stakeholder representatives of Iraq and Turkey on a Plan of Action for promoting exchange and calibration of data and standards pertaining to Tigris river flows was achieved. The consensus, known as the 'Geneva Consensus On Tigris River', was reached at a meeting organized in Geneva by the think tank Strategic Foresight Group. In February 2016, the United States Embassy in Iraq as well as the Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi issued warnings that Mosul Dam could collapse. The United States warned people to evacuate the floodplain of the Tigris because between 500,000 and 1.5 million people were at risk of drowning due to flash flood if the dam collapses, and that the major Iraqi cities of Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad were at risk. Religion and mythology In Sumerian mythology, the Tigris was created by the god Enki, who filled the river with flowing water. In Hittite and Hurrian mythology, Aranzah (or Aranzahas in the Hittite nominative form) is the Hurrian name of the Tigris River, which was deified. He was the son of Kumarbi and the brother of Teshub and Tašmišu, one of the three gods spat out of Kumarbi's mouth onto Mount Kanzuras. Later he colluded with Anu and the Teshub to destroy Kumarbi (The Kumarbi Cycle). The Tigris appears twice in the Old Testament. First, in the Book of Genesis, it is the third of the four rivers branching off the river issuing out of the Garden of Eden. The second mention is in the Book of Daniel, wherein Daniel states he received one of his visions 'when I was by that great river the Tigris'.

"", 'In a second British action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships. The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756. An early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July, 1754. The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with the Indians, since the allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding. The plan that the delegates agreed to was neither ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved by the Crown. Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.

The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle; yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing 'bad medicine' as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry. "", 'several years, while in Europe the French scored an important naval victory and captured the British possession of Minorca in the Mediterranean in 1756. However, after 1757 the war began to turn in favor of Great Britain. British forces defeated French forces in India, and in 1759 British armies invaded and conquered Canada. Facing defeat in North America and a tenuous position in Europe, the French Government attempted to engage the British in peace negotiations, but British Minister William Pitt (the elder), Secretary for Southern Affairs, sought not only the French cession of Canada but also commercial concessions that the French Government found unacceptable. After these negotiations failed, Spanish King Charles III offered to come to the aid of his cousin, French King Louis XV, and their representatives signed an alliance known as the Family Compact on August 15, 1761. The terms of the agreement stated that Spain would declare war ', ""The French and Indian War remains a crucial but often forgotten piece of American history. Here are 10 facts about the French and Indian War, a conflict that is often regarded as a spark that led to the American Revolution. Fact #1: It was part of a global warThe French and Indian War refers to the North American theater of the overarching global war known as the Seven Years' War in Europe. The French and Indian War was fought between Great Britain and France and their colonists, as well as Native American tribes. They fought over territories and expansion throughout North America.Fact #2: George Washington essentially set off the war in North America In 1754, Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, a 22 year old commander of British forces set off with his men towards the coveted Ohio River Valley to assist in building a fort. A small French company of soldiers led by Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville departed French Fort Duquesne to scout intelligence about British movements. When young Washington became aware of the French movement, he set out with his party to meet them, and ambushed them near Great Meadows in Pennsylvania. When the two sides met, Washington ordered his troops to fire, igniting a battle that resulted in the death of Ensign de Jumonville and 9 other French soldiers. After this battle, the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington moved his men into the Great Meadows, an open field, and crudely constructed Fort Necessity as a base. A few weeks later, French forces surrounded the British at Fort Necessity, forcing George Washington to surrender and unknowingly, due to poor translation, sign a document admitting to the assassination of Ensign de Jumonville. "", 'Though often remembered as a frontier colonial war, the French and Indian War was in fact just one theater in a larger global war known as the Seven Years’ War. The French and Indian War represented a clash of empires, people, and cultures, as international interests clashed over the future of the continent of North America.The entire global conflict erupted over a power struggle in the Ohio Valley between the British, the French, and the Native Americans. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish, Dutch, British, and French pioneers explored and colonized different parts of North America. The Spanish settled in the Southern and Western parts of the continent, the French in the Northern parts, the Dutch in the Northeast part, and the British on the eastern seaboard. As European explorers encountered American Indians on the continent, conflict often arose. The Europeans and Indians went through numerous periods of peace and warfare. As the various European colonists moved into different areas of the continent, it often brought them into conflict with each other. While the nations fought wars on the European continent, similar warfare broke out in the various colonies as they each struggled for supremacy of the North American continent. ', 'The French and Indian War (1754-1763) is the name given to the North American theatre of the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), a global conflict involving the major powers of Europe. Though war was not formally declared until 1756, armed conflict began in 1754 as disputes over land claims in the Ohio Valley lead to a series of frontier battles between the French and British. Both received support from various Native American tribes, though the outnumbered French became far more dependent on these allies as the war progressed. The French saw a number of early victories, most notably over George Washington and Edward Braddock in Western Pennsylvania. Washington quickly became a central figure in the conflict, maturing during his tenure in the Virginia militia from an inexperienced young major to the commander in chief of the colony’s regiment. Washington’s involvement during the war’s early stages provided the future President with invaluable military experience while also gaining him positive notoriety that helped to launch his future political career. The tide turned in favor of the British in 1757 when King George II appointed Secretary of State William Pitt to commander of wartime operations.  Pitt believed that securing victories in North America would ensure Britain’s global success, and reinvigorated the war effort by reorganizing military leadership and strengthening the Crown’s relationship with its colonists in America. British assaults on strategic outposts such as Ticonderoga, Niagara, and Quebec in 1759, followed by the successful siege of Montreal in September of 1760, prompted the French surrender. Though Britain’s victory in the French and Indian War expelled France from North America and secured massive territorial gains for the empire, subsequent Crown policies concerning taxation and westward expansion resulted in widespread colonial discontent. The conflict and its aftermath produced substantial ideological divisions between Britain and her North American colonies that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of the American Revolution. The French and Indian War was one of many French-British conflicts fought during the Second Hundred Years’ War (1689-1815), a historical era that included King William’s War (1689-1697), Queen Anne’s War (1702-1713) and King George’s War (1744-1748). The struggle for control over North America that developed into the French and Indian War materialized in the mid-eighteenth century due to a dispute over French land claims in North America. Between 1700 and 1750, the colonial populations of Canada and Louisiana increased significantly, forcing expansion into the Ohio River Valley region. As settlement in this area and the Lower Mississippi Valley increased, New France increased her agricultural output and invested heavily in Louisiana’s sugar economy. During this period, the French strengthened military ties and existing trade relationships with numerous Indian societies, sparking competition with the British for Indigenous allies. By 1749, population growth in the East and a desire for landed wealth from colonial elites prompted the Virginia House of Burgesses to issue large grants of territory in the West to private land companies, such as the Ohio Company. However, competing claims from the French challenged the Ohio Company’s plan for future sale of these lands, prompting the colony of Virginia to initiate efforts toward halting the construction of French forts in western Pennsylvania and removing these rivals from the region. In late October of 1753, twenty-one-year-old George Washington, a major in the Virginia Militia, volunteered to deliver a message to the French on behalf of the colony’s governor, Robert Dinwiddie. The ultimatum ordered that the French halt construction on Fort LeBoeuf in Western Pennsylvania and evacuate lands in the Ohio Valley, or else face an armed attack.

In Europe, Britain sent troops to help its ally, Prussia, which was surrounded by its enemies.

At the start of the war, the French colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers, compared with 2 million in the British colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on their native allies. Two years into the war, in 1756, Great Britain declared war on France, beginning the worldwide Seven Years' War. Many view the French and Indian War as being merely the American theater of this conflict; however, in the United States the French and Indian War is viewed as a singular conflict which was not associated with any European war. French Canadians call it the guerre de la Conquête ('War of the Conquest'). \x1b[92m[1] The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois, Catawba, and Cherokee tribes\x1b[0m, and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy member tribes Abenaki and Mi'kmaq, and the Algonquin, Lenape, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Shawnee, and Wyandot (Huron) tribes. Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from the Province of Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north. It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River called the Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne at the location that later became Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754, during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol.

The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756. An early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July, 1754. The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with the Indians, since the allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding. The plan that the delegates agreed to was neither ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved by the Crown. Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.

The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle; yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing 'bad medicine' as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry.

However, after 1757 the war began to turn in favor of Great Britain. British forces defeated French forces in India, and in 1759 British armies invaded and conquered Canada. Facing defeat in North America and a tenuous position in Europe, the French Government attempted to engage the British in peace negotiations, but British Minister William Pitt (the elder), Secretary for Southern Affairs, sought not only the French cession of Canada but also commercial concessions that the French Government found unacceptable. After these negotiations failed, Spanish King Charles III offered to come to the aid of his cousin, French King Louis XV, and their representatives signed an alliance known as the Family Compact on August 15, 1761.

Here are 10 facts about the French and Indian War, a conflict that is often regarded as a spark that led to the American Revolution. Fact #1: It was part of a global warThe French and Indian War refers to the North American theater of the overarching global war known as the Seven Years' War in Europe. The French and Indian War was fought between Great Britain and France and their colonists, as well as Native American tribes. They fought over territories and expansion throughout North America.Fact #2: George Washington essentially set off the war in North America In 1754, Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, a 22 year old commander of British forces set off with his men towards the coveted Ohio River Valley to assist in building a fort. A small French company of soldiers led by Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville departed French Fort Duquesne to scout intelligence about British movements. When young Washington became aware of the French movement, he set out with his party to meet them, and ambushed them near Great Meadows in Pennsylvania. When the two sides met, Washington ordered his troops to fire, igniting a battle that resulted in the death of Ensign de Jumonville and 9 other French soldiers. After this battle, the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington moved his men into the Great Meadows, an open field, and crudely constructed Fort Necessity as a base. A few weeks later, French forces surrounded the British at Fort Necessity, forcing George Washington to surrender and unknowingly, due to poor translation, sign a document admitting to the assassination of Ensign de Jumonville. "", 'https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/people-involved-french-and-indian-war\nThough often remembered as a frontier colonial war, the French and Indian War was in fact just one theater in a larger global war known as the Seven Years’ War. The French and Indian War represented a clash of empires, people, and cultures, as international interests clashed over the future of the continent of North America.The entire global conflict erupted over a power struggle in the Ohio Valley between the British, the French, and the Native Americans. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish, Dutch, British, and French pioneers explored and colonized different parts of North America. The Spanish settled in the Southern and Western parts of the continent, the French in the Northern parts, the Dutch in the Northeast part, and the British on the eastern seaboard. As European explorers encountered American Indians on the continent, conflict often arose. The Europeans and Indians went through numerous periods of peace and warfare. As the various European colonists moved into different areas of the continent, it often brought them into conflict with each other. While the nations fought wars on the European continent, similar warfare broke out in the various colonies as they each struggled for supremacy of the North American continent. ', 'https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/french-and-indian-war/\nThe French and Indian War (1754-1763) is the name given to the North American theatre of the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), a global conflict involving the major powers of Europe. Though war was not formally declared until 1756, armed conflict began in 1754 as disputes over land claims in the Ohio Valley lead to a series of frontier battles between the French and British. Both received support from various Native American tribes, though the outnumbered French became far more dependent on these allies as the war progressed. The French saw a number of early victories, most notably over George Washington and Edward Braddock in Western Pennsylvania. Washington quickly became a central figure in the conflict, maturing during his tenure in the Virginia militia from an inexperienced young major to the commander in chief of the colony’s regiment. Washington’s involvement during the war’s early stages provided the future President with invaluable military experience while also gaining him positive notoriety that helped to launch his future political career. The tide turned in favor of the British in 1757 when King George II appointed Secretary of State William Pitt to commander of wartime operations.  Pitt believed that securing victories in North America would ensure Britain’s global success, and reinvigorated the war effort by reorganizing military leadership and strengthening the Crown’s relationship with its colonists in America. British assaults on strategic outposts such as Ticonderoga, Niagara, and Quebec in 1759, followed by the successful siege of Montreal in September of 1760, prompted the French surrender. Though Britain’s victory in the French and Indian War expelled France from North America and secured massive territorial gains for the empire, subsequent Crown policies concerning taxation and westward expansion resulted in widespread colonial discontent. The conflict and its aftermath produced substantial ideological divisions between Britain and her North American colonies that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of the American Revolution. The French and Indian War was one of many French-British conflicts fought during the Second Hundred Years’ War (1689-1815), a historical era that included King William’s War (1689-1697), Queen Anne’s War (1702-1713) and King George’s War (1744-1748). The struggle for control over North America that developed into the French and Indian War materialized in the mid-eighteenth century due to a dispute over French land claims in North America. Between 1700 and 1750, the colonial populations of Canada and Louisiana increased significantly, forcing expansion into the Ohio River Valley region. As settlement in this area and the Lower Mississippi Valley increased, New France increased her agricultural output and invested heavily in Louisiana’s sugar economy.

The claims from the 19th century are led by a supposed hit of 175 yards (160 metres) by a fellow named Fellows in 1856. It is still mentioned in Wisden. However, even as long ago as 1960, cricket historian Gerald Brodribb, in his book Hit for Six, was sceptical about this one, and believed that it was a measure of total length of travel, not the length hit to pitch. The shot, which was made in practice, was to publicise a new (but by our standards still primitive) type of bat. The promotional purpose of the claim makes it dubious. ', ""Another hint comes from the low number of over-the-boundary hits in the 19th and early 20th century. Detailed research by cricket historian Ross Smith and others comes up with a total of just 95 such over-the-boundary hits in Tests prior to 1900. Under the scoring system of the time, most of those shots counted as five (or sometimes four) runs, but even if counted as sixes, that represents only 1.2% of all runs scored. In Tests since 2000 on the same grounds, more than 3% of runs have come through sixes. Even allowing for modern boundary ropes, why were there so few such hits back then if so many players could supposedly strike the ball 130 yards and more, especially since it was possible, before 1910, to score a six by hitting the ball 'out of the ground'? In more than 60 Tests in England and Australia before 1902, only two such out-of-the-ground hits were recorded. Both were by Joe Darling, one in Adelaide in 1898 (over the short square boundary) and one, according to the Melbourne Argus, at Trent Bridge in 1899.

Matches are measured in overs (6 balls bowled per over) and an ‘innings’ is a descriptor for the number of times the teams contest each other. Format Innings/Overs Duration T20 1/ 20 (max) ~3 hours: 75-90min innings, 10-20min interval One Day "", 'https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1026113/the-longest-shot\nThere are two periods where hits beyond 120 metres have been reported regularly: back in the 19th century, and more recently, in the past couple of decades. The claims from the 19th century are led by a supposed hit of 175 yards (160 metres) by a fellow named Fellows in 1856. It is still mentioned in Wisden. However, even as long ago as 1960, cricket historian Gerald Brodribb, in his book Hit for Six, was sceptical about this one, and believed that it was a measure of total length of travel, not the length hit to pitch. The shot, which was made in practice, was to publicise a new (but by our standards still primitive) type of bat. The promotional purpose of the claim makes it dubious. ', ""https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1026113/the-longest-shot\nAnother hint comes from the low number of over-the-boundary hits in the 19th and early 20th century. Detailed research by cricket historian Ross Smith and others comes up with a total of just 95 such over-the-boundary hits in Tests prior to 1900. Under the scoring system of the time, most of those shots counted as five (or sometimes four) runs, but even if counted as sixes, that represents only 1.2% of all runs scored. In Tests since 2000 on the same grounds, more than 3% of runs have come through sixes. Even allowing for modern boundary ropes, why were there so few such hits back then if so many players could supposedly strike the ball 130 yards and more, especially since it was possible, before 1910, to score a six by hitting the ball 'out of the ground'? In more than 60 Tests in England and Australia before 1902, only two such out-of-the-ground hits were recorded. Both were by Joe Darling, one in Adelaide in 1898 (over the short square boundary) and one, according to the Melbourne Argus, at Trent Bridge in 1899.

', ""Centipedes (from Neo-Latin centi-, 'hundred', and Latin pes, pedis, 'foot') are predatory arthropods belonging to the class Chilopoda (Ancient Greek χεῖλος, kheilos, 'lip', and Neo-Latin suffix -poda, 'foot', describing the forcipules) of the subphylum Myriapoda, an arthropod group which includes millipedes and other multi-legged animals. Centipedes are elongated segmented (metameric) creatures with one pair of legs per body segment. All centipedes are venomous and can inflict painful stings, injecting their venom through pincer-like appendages known as forcipules or toxicognaths, which are actually modified legs instead of fangs. Despite the name, no centipede has exactly 100 pairs of legs; the number of pairs of legs is an odd number that ranges from 15 pairs to 191 pairs. Centipedes are predominantly generalist carnivorous, hunting for a variety of prey items that can be overpowered. They have a wide geographical range, which can be found in terrestrial habitats from tropical rainforests to deserts. Within these habitats, centipedes require a moist microhabitat because they lack the waxy cuticle of insects and arachnids, therefore causing them to rapidly lose water. Accordingly, they avoid direct sunlight by staying under cover or by being active at night. Description Centipedes have a rounded or flattened head, bearing a pair of antennae at the forward margin. They have a pair of elongated mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. The first pair of maxillae form the lower lip, and bear short palps. The first pair of limbs stretch forward from the body over the mouth. These limbs, or forcipules, end in sharp claws and include venom glands that help the animal to kill or paralyze its prey. "", 'Centipedes grow their legs at different points in their development. In the primitive condition, seen in the orders Lithobiomorpha, Scutigeromorpha, and Craterostigmomorpha, development is anamorphic: more segments and pairs of legs are grown between moults. For example, Scutigera coleoptrata, the house centipede, hatches with only four pairs of legs and in successive moults has 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 15, 15 and 15 pairs respectively, before becoming a sexually mature adult. Life stages with fewer than 15 pairs of legs are called larval stadia (there are about five stages). After the full complement of legs is achieved, the now postlarval stadia (about five more stages) develop gonopods, sensory pores, more antennal segments, and more ocelli. All mature lithobiomorph centipedes have 15 leg-bearing segments. The Craterostigmomorpha only have one phase of anamorphosis, with embryos having 12 pairs, and adults 15. ', 'Another similar group, which you’ve probably never heard of, are the symphylans (class Symphyla). Also called dwarf millipedes, garden centipedes, and symphylids, they resemble tiny, soft, white centipedes and only reach about ¼ inch long. Like centipedes, they have 1 pair of legs in each of the main body segments. The antennae are slender, sensitive, with many segments. Mature adults have 12 pairs of legs; hatchlings have 6 pairs. Often found in greenhouses and may be pests, as they can damage plant roots. Other Common Names Hundred-Leggers Size Adult size varies with species. Most are only about ½ to 1 inch long. Our largest species, found only in our southernmost counties, can reach 8 inches in length. Where To Find Statewide. Different species have different habitat preferences and therefore may have different distribution patterns within the state. Habitat and Conservation ', ""Centipedes are grouped with 3 other classes (millipedes, pauropods, and symphylans) into a subphylum called Myriapoda (the many-legged animals). All have numerous, rather repetitive body segments, and most groups have one or two pairs of legs per segment. It's easy to see how their wormlike bodies are different from those of insects, spiders, and crustaceans. Life Cycle Life Cycle Males deposit a sperm packet (spermatophore), which the female picks up. In some species, the males perform a courtship dance to entice females to accept the spermatophore, while in others the females discover the spermatophores fairly randomly. "", ""Centipedes Centipedes are long, thin arthropods with one pair of legs per body segment. Despite 'centi' in their name, which implies 100 legs, centipedes have anywhere from fewer than 20 legs to over 300 legs, but they always have an odd number of pairs of legs. Lacking the waxy cuticle of insects and arachnids, centipedes lose body moisture rapidly and therefore reside in moist microhabitats such as soil and leaf litter, underneath stones and dead wood, and inside rotting logs. Although centipedes are present in Catoctin Mountain Park, they are not commonly seen because they are mostly nocturnal. Many species lack eyes and are only capable of discerning light and dark. Centipedes are primarily carnivorous. They eat other arthropods, worms and even other centipedes. They use their antennae to seek out their prey, and then immobilize it with venom injected from their forcipules, which are modified legs. A centipede bite to a human can be very painful and may cause severe swelling and more serious reactions, especially to children and those with allergies to bee stings. Millipedes Millipedes mating Photo by Alicia Lafever Millipedes are commonly seen in the park and do not bite or sting. Millipedes have two pairs of legs on most body segments. Despite 'milli' in their name, millipedes do not have 1,000 legs, but common species have anywhere from 36 to 400 legs. Having many short legs, millipedes move much more slowly than centipedes, but they are powerful burrowers. Because of their lack of speed and inability to bite or sting, a millipede's primary defense mechanism is to curl into a tight coil, thereby protecting their delicate legs "", ""| OrkinSkip to ContentNeed pest help?

The number of legs a centipede has depends upon the number of body segments that make up its body, and this number varies by species. Centipedes typically have one pair of legs per segment.A fully equipped adult centipede can have between 15 and 177 pairs of legs. Members of the Orders Lithobiomorpha and Scutigeromorpha have 15 pairs of legs. Unlike other centipede species, the Scutigera have long, multiarticulate, hairy legs, which enable them to establish a solid grip on the ground and move very quickly. However, Scutigera centipedes are not capable of pushing themselves through soil or into detritus. The house centipede has a rounded trunk with long, delicate legs, while the Geophilomorphs have long, slender bodies with up to 177 pairs of short legs. The colorful Scolopendromorphs have from 21 to 23 pairs of legs.The body segment behind the centipede's head contains two legs which have been modified into venomous fangs for hunting prey. To aid in balance and agility, the legs of most centipede species become progressively longer the farther away they are from the head. The last pair of legs trails behind the centipede's body and is equipped with sensory bristles. These legs act as a supplementary pair of antennae, allowing centipedes to back out of tight spaces. Centipedes are capable of dropping their legs when their survival depends upon it and can regenerate these body parts after shedding them.Like millipedes, centipedes are arthropods with jointed legs. However, while millipedes have more than one pair of legs attached to each of their body segments, centipedes have only one pair per segment.

That’s been confirmed by the show’s wiki page. It also explains all of the huge pine trees Jerry grabs onto in 'Rattlestar Ricklatica.' More On: Rick and Morty "", ""Rick and Morty is an American animated science-fiction comedy franchise, whose eponymous duo consists of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith. Rick and Morty were created by cartoonist Justin Roiland for a 2006 parody film of Back to the Future for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Dan Harmon. After six years, the sketch was developed into Rick and Morty, a half-hour prime time show that was a hit for Adult Swim, receiving universal acclaim across all seasons. Alongside the original television series, the characters of the show have been featured in a variety of media, including spin-offs, comic books, musical releases and video games. The show has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in income across their merchandising and media franchise. The series centers on the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures, with the characters traveling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying car. Different versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the show's multiverse and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The Rick and Morty franchise has received widespread critical acclaim, winning two Annie and Emmy Awards. Background Creation Justin Roiland conceived of the idea for Rick and Morty as an evolution of his 2006 short film parody series The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, inspired by Back to the Future and Scud: The Disposable Assassin, the latter series of which future Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon had written for. Themes Dan Harmon has described Rick and Morty as 'a never-ending fart joke wrapped around a studied look into nihilism'. The formula of the series consists of juxtapositioning two conflicting scenarios: an extremely selfish, alcoholic grandfather dragging his grandson along for interdimensional adventures, intercut with domestic family drama, while addressing the insignificance of human existence as compared to the size of the universe, with no recognizable divine presence, as described by H. P. Lovecraft's philosophy of cosmicism. The characters of the series deal with existential dread and cosmic horror, either by asserting the utility of science over magic or by choosing a life in ignorant bliss. However, as Joachim Heijndermans of Geeks notes, none of the characters appear able to handle the absurd and chaotic nature of the universe, as Jerry gets by through denial while Rick is a 'depressed, substance-addicted, suicidal mess'. Harmon describes the titular Rick Sanchez as a self-interested anarchist, who doesn't like being told what to do. He believes that the character's life on a larger scale has caused him mental illness, and opines that 'the knowledge that nothing matters—while accurate—gets you nowhere'. Matthew Bulger of The Humanist noted that the creators of the series were trying to communicate the message that we need to focus on human relationships and not preoccupy our minds with unanswerable questions, in order to find a sense of purpose and live a better life. Eric Armstrong of The New Republic notes that Morty represents the audience, as he is 'mostly there to react to Rick's deranged schemes'. The character is transformed by the truths he discovers during his interdimensional adventures with his grandfather. However, instead of sinking into depression, Morty accepts these truths that empower him to value his own life. Occasionally, characters will acknowledge an episode's narrative or hint at the presence of a fourth wall, suggesting that they are aware of the fact that they are characters of a television series. Thereunder, Troy Patterson of The New Yorker notes that Rick and Morty 'supplies an artful answer to the question of what follows postmodernism: a decadent regurgitation of all its tropes, all at once, leavened by some humanistic wistfulness.' Sean Sebastian of Junkee says that the show can be both hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time as it excels at the 'intersection between big ideas, flippancy and wit.' Main characters See also: List of Rick and Morty characters The main characters of the show are the members of the Smith household, which consists of parents Jerry and Beth, their children Summer and Morty, and Beth's father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with them as a guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of Seattle, Washington. Richard 'Rick' Sanchez, voiced by Justin Roiland,(season 1-season 6), Ian Cardoni (season 7-present) is a sociopathic, nihilistic, narcissistic, self-centered, alcoholic mad scientist who is the father of Beth Smith and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer. One of Rick's interdimensional counterparts, Rick Prime, serves as the main antagonist of the series. Roiland considers his voice for Rick to be a 'horrible Doc Brown manic impression'. Mortimer 'Morty' Smith Sr., voiced by Justin Roiland, (season 1-season 6), Harry Belden (season 7-present) is Rick's neurotic 14-year-old grandson, son of Jerry and Beth Smith and younger brother of Summer Smith, who is frequently dragged into Rick's misadventures. One of Morty's interdimensional counterparts, President Morty Smith (nicknamed 'Evil Morty' by fans and the media), serves as the secondary antagonist of the series. Roiland considers his initial voice for Morty to be a 'horrible Marty McFly impression'.

Directed by Scott Cooper and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth, it is based on Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill's 2001 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob. The film features an ensemble cast led by Johnny Depp as Bulger, alongside Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Peter Sarsgaard, Dakota Johnson, and Corey Stoll. Principal photography of the film took place in Boston between May and August 2014. The film had its world premiere at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival and was released by Warner Bros. worldwide on September 18, 2015. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $100 million on a $53 million budget. Plot "", ""Johnny Depp's involvement with Black Mass dates back to February 2013, when he was attached to star in the film, while Barry Levinson was still slated to direct and principal photography was scheduled to begin in May 2013. Depp briefly exited the project shortly after its sale at the 66th annual Cannes Film Festival, because of a salary dispute with Cross Creek Pictures. He later rejoined at around the same time Scott Cooper was attached to replace Levinson as director, and his signing for the film was made official in February 2014. Jesse Plemons and Juno Temple joined the cast to play as Kevin Weeks (a cohort of Bulger) and Deborah Hussey, one of Bulger's victims, respectively, around April 2014. Plemons reportedly prepared for his role by hiring a dialect coach and studying video of the actual Kevin Weeks. "", ""The roles of Connolly – who was Whitey Bulger's FBI handler – and his first wife Marianne, were filled by Joel Edgerton and Julianne Nicholson, respectively. Cooper chose Nicholson for the part after her performance as Sally in Sam Shepard's off-Broadway play Heartless (before Claire van der Boom succeeded her for the play's two-week extension). Edgerton developed his portrayal of Connolly by studying past footage of the FBI agent before his imprisonment, some of which include his appearances on talk shows and in courtrooms. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Edgerton stated that he declined trying to meet with the actual Connolly, reasoning that Connolly 'has one version of events and the film has a different version'. Edgerton originally dropped out of the project when Depp agreed to return, and Tom Hardy was in early talks for the role. However, Edgerton returned in the role. "", ""On June 9, Depp's 51st birthday, he was filming scenes on location in Quincy, while Dakota Johnson was in Back Bay, playing Whitey Bulger's longtime former girlfriend, Lindsey Cyr. On June 11, shooting was underway in Lynn, where the crew was filming scenes in which Bulger and Stephen Flemmi pick up a prostitute named Deborah Hussey (played by Juno Temple) from the police station. Temple was seen on the set. On June 16, Depp and Plemons were spotted on the set of the film in South Boston. "", ""On July 15, Cumberbatch wrapped filming for his part in Boston. On July 21, Depp filmed some scenes at the former Anthony's Hawthorne restaurant, located at Oxford Street and Central Avenue in Lynn, which wrapped up filming for his role. In July, director Cooper told The Boston Globe that filming had to take place for two more weeks in Boston, focusing on the FBI's role in the Bulger story. On July 25, Kevin Bacon was in Boston, filming some remaining scenes for the film. According to The Boston Globe, filming for Black Mass wrapped up on August 1, 2014, in Boston. Post-production Sienna Miller was cast and filmed scenes as Catherine Greig, Bulger's companion while a fugitive, but her scenes ended up getting cut from the film due to 'narrative choices'. Erica McDermott was cast as Mary Bulger, wife of Billy Bulger, but the majority of her scenes were cut out. Release "", ""In Black Mass, Johnny Depp transforms into notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. Black Mass is based on the true story of gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. Author: Kim Holcomb and KING 5 Evening (KING) Published: 8:24 PM PDT September 17, 2015 Updated: 8:24 PM PDT September 17, 2015 SEATTLE - He's known for being something of a shape-shifter, and in Black Mass Johnny Depp transforms into notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. 'I had done so much research and had seen photos of Jimmy Bulger, and to see him, the resemblance is uncanny,' said actress Dakota Johnson. The Fifty Shades of Grey star plays Bulger's girlfriend. She's just one member of an all-star cast who recreate the era when the gangster worked as an FBI informant in exchange for the agency turning a blind eye to his own criminal enterprise. "", ""'Black Mass,' about the tangled criminal history of Boston gang boss James 'Whitey' Bulger, is a bizarre movie. It really doesn't work until you tune into its wavelength. But if can do that, you may start to see method behind the film's madness and end up feeling as I did—that for all of its flaws, it's the first film since 'Eastern Promises' that has added anything truly fresh to the old school street-level gangster story.The general outlines wouldn't seem to promise anything like that sort of experience, and Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk's screenplay sometimes treats its flashback structure (articulated through FBI interrogations of key Bulger associates) as an excuse to tell, even summarize, rather than show. Testimonials become voice-over narration that papers over holes in the chronology. We meet Bulger and two powerful people who shield and enable him: his senator brother William 'Billy' Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his childhood friend turned FBI agent James Connolly (Joel Edgerton). We watch as Connolly hatches a plan to pay back Bulger, who protected him when they were kids, by helping the gangster inform on the Italian mob that's muscling in on his turf—essentially offering up the FBI as Bulger's unwitting private army, waging war on rivals. We meet Bulger's doting girlfriend Lindsey Cyr (Dakota Johnson) and his adorable son, Douglas Cyr (Luke Ryan), and of course Bulger's criminal gang; their ranks include Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, and the great W. Earl Brown, who's turning into the Warren Oates of modern urban potboilers. All of the performers are superb and have at least one indelible moment, but remain rather undefined as individuals. They fade in and out of the story willy-nilly, and sometimes when one of them shows up again you're surprised to see him because you forgot he was still alive. The sole exception is Peter Sarsgaard, whose supporting turn as a jumpy cokehead sums up a man's pathetic life in just four scenes. "", ""Cyr dated Bulger for 12 years and said she knew nothing of his murderous dark side. She said she only saw a loving father to their son, Douglass.Dakota Johnson plays Cyr in Black Mass, but Cyr said scenes from the film misrepresent Bulger's relationship with his son, who died at age six after a severe reaction to medicine.''If you do something and no one sees it, you didn't do it,'' Cyr repeated a line from the movie. 'I would have smacked him in the back of the head and said, 'What the hell are you talking about?''Cyr does not give the movie high praise and said she's also critical of the U.S. attorney's new attempt to tack more time onto Catherine Greig's sentence as they try to determine how she and Bulger managed to elude capture for 16 years.'That woman never had a choice in anything that happened from the minute she said 'Yes dear I'll go with you,'' Cyr said. 'I'm sure she wouldn't know.'

The film features an ensemble cast led by Johnny Depp as Bulger, alongside Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Peter Sarsgaard, Dakota Johnson, and Corey Stoll. Principal photography of the film took place in Boston between May and August 2014. The film had its world premiere at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival and was released by Warner Bros. worldwide on September 18, 2015. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $100 million on a $53 million budget. Plot "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mass_(film)\nJohnny Depp's involvement with Black Mass dates back to February 2013, when he was attached to star in the film, while Barry Levinson was still slated to direct and principal photography was scheduled to begin in May 2013. Depp briefly exited the project shortly after its sale at the 66th annual Cannes Film Festival, because of a salary dispute with Cross Creek Pictures. He later rejoined at around the same time Scott Cooper was attached to replace Levinson as director, and his signing for the film was made official in February 2014. Jesse Plemons and Juno Temple joined the cast to play as Kevin Weeks (a cohort of Bulger) and Deborah Hussey, one of Bulger's victims, respectively, around April 2014. Plemons reportedly prepared for his role by hiring a dialect coach and studying video of the actual Kevin Weeks. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mass_(film)\nThe roles of Connolly – who was Whitey Bulger's FBI handler – and his first wife Marianne, were filled by Joel Edgerton and Julianne Nicholson, respectively. Cooper chose Nicholson for the part after her performance as Sally in Sam Shepard's off-Broadway play Heartless (before Claire van der Boom succeeded her for the play's two-week extension). Edgerton developed his portrayal of Connolly by studying past footage of the FBI agent before his imprisonment, some of which include his appearances on talk shows and in courtrooms. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Edgerton stated that he declined trying to meet with the actual Connolly, reasoning that Connolly 'has one version of events and the film has a different version'. Edgerton originally dropped out of the project when Depp agreed to return, and Tom Hardy was in early talks for the role. However, Edgerton returned in the role. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mass_(film)\nOn June 9, Depp's 51st birthday, he was filming scenes on location in Quincy, while Dakota Johnson was in Back Bay, playing Whitey Bulger's longtime former girlfriend, Lindsey Cyr. On June 11, shooting was underway in Lynn, where the crew was filming scenes in which Bulger and Stephen Flemmi pick up a prostitute named Deborah Hussey (played by Juno Temple) from the police station. Temple was seen on the set. On June 16, Depp and Plemons were spotted on the set of the film in South Boston. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mass_(film)\nOn July 15, Cumberbatch wrapped filming for his part in Boston. On July 21, Depp filmed some scenes at the former Anthony's Hawthorne restaurant, located at Oxford Street and Central Avenue in Lynn, which wrapped up filming for his role. In July, director Cooper told The Boston Globe that filming had to take place for two more weeks in Boston, focusing on the FBI's role in the Bulger story. On July 25, Kevin Bacon was in Boston, filming some remaining scenes for the film. According to The Boston Globe, filming for Black Mass wrapped up on August 1, 2014, in Boston. Post-production Sienna Miller was cast and filmed scenes as Catherine Greig, Bulger's companion while a fugitive, but her scenes ended up getting cut from the film due to 'narrative choices'. Erica McDermott was cast as Mary Bulger, wife of Billy Bulger, but the majority of her scenes were cut out.

Black Mass is based on the true story of gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. Author: Kim Holcomb and KING 5 Evening (KING) Published: 8:24 PM PDT September 17, 2015 Updated: 8:24 PM PDT September 17, 2015 SEATTLE - He's known for being something of a shape-shifter, and in Black Mass Johnny Depp transforms into notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. 'I had done so much research and had seen photos of Jimmy Bulger, and to see him, the resemblance is uncanny,' said actress Dakota Johnson. The Fifty Shades of Grey star plays Bulger's girlfriend. She's just one member of an all-star cast who recreate the era when the gangster worked as an FBI informant in exchange for the agency turning a blind eye to his own criminal enterprise. "", ""https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/black-mass-2015\n'Black Mass,' about the tangled criminal history of Boston gang boss James 'Whitey' Bulger, is a bizarre movie. It really doesn't work until you tune into its wavelength. But if can do that, you may start to see method behind the film's madness and end up feeling as I did—that for all of its flaws, it's the first film since 'Eastern Promises' that has added anything truly fresh to the old school street-level gangster story.The general outlines wouldn't seem to promise anything like that sort of experience, and Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk's screenplay sometimes treats its flashback structure (articulated through FBI interrogations of key Bulger associates) as an excuse to tell, even summarize, rather than show. Testimonials become voice-over narration that papers over holes in the chronology. We meet Bulger and two powerful people who shield and enable him: his senator brother William 'Billy' Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his childhood friend turned FBI agent James Connolly (Joel Edgerton). We watch as Connolly hatches a plan to pay back Bulger, who protected him when they were kids, by helping the gangster inform on the Italian mob that's muscling in on his turf—essentially offering up the FBI as Bulger's unwitting private army, waging war on rivals. We meet Bulger's doting girlfriend Lindsey Cyr (Dakota Johnson) and his adorable son, Douglas Cyr (Luke Ryan), and of course Bulger's criminal gang; their ranks include Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, and the great W. Earl Brown, who's turning into the Warren Oates of modern urban potboilers. All of the performers are superb and have at least one indelible moment, but remain rather undefined as individuals. They fade in and out of the story willy-nilly, and sometimes when one of them shows up again you're surprised to see him because you forgot he was still alive. The sole exception is Peter Sarsgaard, whose supporting turn as a jumpy cokehead sums up a man's pathetic life in just four scenes. "", ""https://www.wcvb.com/article/bulger-s-ex-hollywood-got-a-lot-wrong-in-black-mass/8228979\nCyr dated Bulger for 12 years and said she knew nothing of his murderous dark side. She said she only saw a loving father to their son, Douglass.Dakota Johnson plays Cyr in Black Mass, but Cyr said scenes from the film misrepresent Bulger's relationship with his son, who died at age six after a severe reaction to medicine.''If you do something and no one sees it, you didn't do it,'' Cyr repeated a line from the movie. 'I would have smacked him in the back of the head and said, 'What the hell are you talking about?''Cyr does not give the movie high praise and said she's also critical of the U.S. attorney's new attempt to tack more time onto Catherine Greig's sentence as they try to determine how she and Bulger managed to elude capture for 16 years.'That woman never had a choice in anything that happened from the minute she said 'Yes dear I'll go with you,'' Cyr said. 'I'm sure she wouldn't know.'

It's a lot more action packed than Insurgent and Divergent, there's a lot of running, the wall sequences that we see in the trailer was the best action scene in the movie.

Although Woodley wanted to return to complete Tris’ story, she only expressed willingness for a theatrical movie. The actress later admitted how disappointed she was with the saga's ending that she even considered quitting acting entirely. This similar lack of interest from the original cast eventually killed The Divergent Series: Ascendant in 2018, after years of development. "", ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3410834/reviews\nThe Divergent Series: Allegiant is the latest Divergent movies that comes out at March 10 in England and March 18 in USA starring Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Jeff Daniels, Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, Maggie Q, With Octavia Spencer, and Naomi Watts. Once again, Shailene Woddley is bringing the best performance through the whole movie, We get to see more of Tobias in this one instead of just Woodley's character, Tris. The Visual Effects were amazing, The cinematography was incredible and of course, The acting was fantastic, Especially Woodley. It's a lot more action packed than Insurgent and Divergent, there's a lot of running, the wall sequences that we see in the trailer was the best action scene in the movie. Four and Tris chemistry is better in this one. Though the last 30 minutes of this movie is more like 'Ok people, let's wrap it up'. But you will be impressed through the whole movie by Woodley's work. She's definitely a big ++ for this movie. The only issued i have was the pacing and plot. It was kinda messy but very well put together. 7.8/10 ""]",,,gKMqFz1xmDEbCM8,[20.3131456375122],2024-09-05 20:19:01.739182+00,"[{'annotations': [1, 1], 'sentence_id': 0}]","[{'coverage': 1, 'sentence_id': 0}]",[True],1,1
103,444,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(United_States_coin)\nThe cent, the United States of America one-cent coin (symbol: ¢), often called the 'penny', is a unit of currency equaling one one-hundredth of a United States of America dollar. It has been the lowest face-value physical unit of U.S. currency since the abolition of the half-cent in 1857 (the abstract mill, which has never been minted, equal to a tenth of a cent, continues to see limited use in the fields of taxation and finance). The first U.S. cent was produced in 1787, and the cent has been issued primarily as a copper or copper-plated coin throughout its history. Due to inflation, pennies have lost virtually all their purchasing power and are often viewed as an expensive burden to businesses, banks, government (especially mints) and the public in general. The penny is issued in its current form as the Lincoln cent, with its obverse featuring the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909, the centennial of his birth. From 1959 (the sesquicentennial of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial. Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln's 200th birthday and a new, 'permanent' reverse – the Union Shield – was introduced in 2010. The coin is 0.75 inches (19.05 mm) in diameter and 0.0598 inches (1.52 mm) in thickness. The current copper-plated zinc cent issued since 1982 weighs 2.5 grams, while the previous 95% copper cent still found in circulation weighed 3.11 g (see further below). In 1943, at the peak of World War II, zinc-coated steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper. A few copper cents from 1943 were produced from 1942 planchets remaining in the bins. Similarly, some 1944 steel cents have been confirmed. From 1944 to 1946, salvaged ammunition shells made their way into the minting process, and it was not uncommon to see coins featuring streaks of brass or having a considerably darker finish than other issues. During the early 1970s, the price of copper rose to the point where the cent contained almost one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternative metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and over 1.5 million samples of the 1974 aluminum cent were struck before ultimately being rejected. \x1b[92m[1] The cent's composition was changed in 1982 because the value of the copper in the coin started to rise above one cent\x1b[0m. Some 1982 cents used the 97.5% zinc composition, while others used the 95% copper composition. With the exception of 2009 bicentennial cents minted specifically for collectors, United States cents minted after 1982 have been zinc with copper plating. The bronze and copper cents can be distinguished from the newer zinc cents by dropping the coins on a solid surface, or by flipping them in the air with your thumb. The predominantly zinc coins make a lower-pitched 'clunk' when hitting the surface, and make no sound when flipped in the air; while the copper coins produce a higher-pitched ringing sound. In addition, a full 50-cent roll of pre-1982/3 coins weighs 5.4 oz (150 g) compared to a post-1982–83 roll which weighs 4.4 oz (120 g). Designs The Lincoln cent is the current one-cent coin of the U.S. It was adopted in 1909 (which would have been Lincoln's 100th birthday), replacing the Indian Head cent. Its reverse was changed in 1959 from a wheat-stalks design to a design which includes the Lincoln Memorial (to commemorate Lincoln's sesquicentennial) and was replaced again in 2009 with four new designs to commemorate Lincoln's bicentennial. There are more one-cent coins produced than any other denomination, which makes the Lincoln cent a familiar item. In its lifespan, this coin has weathered both world wars, one of which temporarily changed its composition as part of the war effort.

The drawings are from An Essay on Coinage by Samuel Thompson. Although published in Ireland in 1783, the drawings show methods and machinery similar to those at the Mint. Screw presses fitted with a lower and upper die stamped the coin designs. They were operated by one to three men, depending on the size of the press. Smaller screw presses operated by one man were also used as cutting presses. In March of 1793 the Mint delivered its first circulating coins: 11,178 copper cents. Silver coin production started the following year and gold coinage began in 1795. Coining was slow; it’s possible that each press could only produce a couple dozen coins per minute.

The Switch to Steam Power ', ""Copper coins, such as the penny, started as pure copper, but rising copper prices led to changes in composition. In 1857, the Mint added nickel to the copper, but switched to tin and zinc in 1864. For the year 1943, pennies became zinc-coated steel because copper was essential to the war effort during World War II. But the Mint also struck a limited number of copper pennies. In 1962 tin was eliminated, and in 1982 the penny became primarily zinc with only 2.5% copper. Silver coins (half dime, dime, quarter, half dollar, dollar) originally consisted of a fineness of .8924, changing to .900 in 1837. In 1866, the new five-cent coin became the first to eliminate silver with a new composition of copper and nickel. It gained the name 'nickel' from its composition. In 1965, the dime and quarter followed, and in 1971, none of the circulating coins contained silver. "", ""Most of our coins are metal sandwiches.

Only nickels are one solid material—that same 75% copper/25% nickel alloy. Would you like fries with that? This penny is almost as big as a half dollar... America's first one-cent piece, called the 'large cent,' was first struck in 1793, one year after the Mint opened.

He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees. The Soviet troops would arrive in Cuba heavily underprepared.

Defensive missile transporters, it was believed, could make such turns without undue difficulty. The reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed.

By May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans 'with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles'.:\u200a29\u200a The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on 4 July and Khrushchev on 7 July.

A total of 43,000 foreign troops would ultimately be brought in. Chief Marshal of Artillery Sergei Biryuzov, Head of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that visited Cuba. He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees. The Soviet troops would arrive in Cuba heavily underprepared. They did not know that the tropical climate would render ineffective many of their weapons and much of their equipment. In the first few days of setting up the missiles, troops complained of fuse failures, excessive corrosion, overconsumption of oil, and generator blackouts.

The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles. Only five reports bothered the analysts. They described large trucks passing through towns at night that were carrying very long canvas-covered cylindrical objects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and maneuvering. Defensive missile transporters, it was believed, could make such turns without undue difficulty. The reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed.

Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. The Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was known to only 9 US officials at the time of its creation in October 1963 and was first officially acknowledged at a conference in Moscow in January 1989 by Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin and Kennedy's speechwriter Theodore Sorensen. In his negotiations with Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed 'within a short time after this crisis was over'.:\u200a222\u200a Under an operation code-named Operation Pot Pie, the removal of the Jupiters from Italy and Turkey began on 1 April, and was completed by 24 April 1963. The initial plans were to recycle the missiles for use in other programs, but NASA and the USAF were not interested in retaining the missile hardware. The missile bodies were destroyed on site, while warheads, guidance packages, and launching equipment worth $14 million were returned to the United States. The dismantling operations were named Pot Pie I for Italy and Pot Pie II for Turkey by the United States Air Force.

After many long and difficult meetings, Kennedy decided to place a naval blockade, or a ring of ships, around Cuba.

', 'Using water is one common method to extinguish a fire. Water extinguishes a fire by cooling, which removes heat because of water’s ability to absorb massive amounts of heat as it converts to water vapor. Without heat, the fuel cannot keep the oxidizer from reducing the fuel in order to sustain the fire. Water also extinguishes a fire by smothering it. When water is heated to its boiling point, it converts to water vapor. When this conversion takes place, it dilutes the oxygen in the air above the fire, thus removing one of the elements that the fire requires to burn. This can also be done with foam. Another way to extinguish a fire is fuel removal. This can be accomplished by stopping the flow of liquid or gaseous fuel, by removing solid fuel in the path of a fire, or by allowing the fire to burn until all the fuel is consumed, at which point the fire will self-extinguish. ', ""One common way to extinguish a fire is to spray it with water. The water has two roles: It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire, and this vapor displaces the oxygen (the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water, at 1,000 °F (538 °C) it expands over 4,000 times). This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent, and it dies out. The vaporization of water also absorbs heat; it thereby cools the smoke, air, walls, and objects that could act as further fuel, and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow, which is by 'jumping' to nearby heat/fuel sources to start new fires, which then combine. Water extinguishment is thus a combination of 'asphyxia' (cutting off the oxygen supply) and cooling. The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia, but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area. For outdoor fires, the seat of the fire is sprayed with a straight spray: the cooling effect immediately follows the 'asphyxia' caused by vaporization and reduces the further amount of water required. This is because water droplets, upon forming in to water mist, increase their surface area by a large magnitude, greatly increasing the endothermic cooling effect and robbing the fire of oxygen. A straight spray is used so the water arrives massively to the seat of the fire before it vaporizes. A strong spray may also have a mechanical effect; it can disperse the combustible product and thus prevent the fire from starting again. Spray is always aimed at a surface or an object. For this reason, the strategy is sometimes called a two-dimensional or 2D attack. Until the 1970s, fires were usually attacked while they declined, using the same strategy as for open air fires. Now fires are attacked in their development phase because firefighters arrive sooner at the site of a fire and because of changes in building construction. The increasing use of thermal insulation confines the heat, and modern materials, especially polymers, produce much more heat than do traditional materials like wood, plaster, stone, and bricks. Under these conditions, there is a greater risk of backdraft and flashover. Directly spraying the seat of the fire in enclosed areas can have unfortunate consequences: the force of water pushes air in front of it, which supplies the fire with extra oxygen before the water. The most important issue is not combating the flames, but controlling the fire; for example, cooling the smoke so that it cannot spread and start fires further away, and endanger the lives of people, including the firefighters. "", ""cools the smoke which is then less likely to start a fire when it moves away. As gas cools it becomes denser (Charles's law); thus, it also reduces the mobility of the smoke and avoids a 'backfire' of water vapor. Also, the diffuse spray creates an inert 'water vapor sky', which prevents 'roll-over' (rolls of flames on the ceiling created by hot burning gases). Only short pulses of water need to be sprayed, otherwise the spraying modifies the equilibrium, and the gases mix instead of remaining stratified: the hot gases (initially at the ceiling) move around the room, and the temperature rises at the ground, which is dangerous for firefighters. An alternative is to cool all the atmosphere by spraying the whole atmosphere as if drawing letters in the air ('penciling'). "", 'In such cases, it is necessary to asphyxiate the fire. This can be done in a variety of ways. Chemical products which react with the fuel can be used to stop the combustion. A layer of water-based fire retardant foam can be applied by the fire hose in order to separate the oxygen in the air from the fuel. carbon dioxide, halon, or sodium bicarbonate can be used. In the case of very small fires and in the absence of other extinguishing agents, covering the flame with a fire blanket can eliminate oxygen flow to the fire. A simple and usually effective way to put out a fire in a stove-top pan is to put a lid on the pan and leave it there. Tactical ventilation or isolation of the fire One of the main risks of a fire is the smoke; because, it carries heat and poisonous gases, and obscures vision. In the case of a fire in a closed location (building), the following two different strategies may be used: isolation of the fire or ventilation. ', 'A carbon dioxide extinguisher or a fire blanket can be used to remove oxygen from the area around the fire. The carbon dioxide extinguisher pulls oxygen away from the fire and replaces it with non-flammable, denser-than-air carbon dioxide. Fire blankets create a barrier around the fire to keep it from getting extra oxygen. Another method of drawing away oxygen would be closing doors during an evacuation of a building. This stops a new supply of oxygen from entering. Heat Heat automatically comes to mind when you think about fire. One of the best ways to weaken and ultimately put out a fire is to reduce its heat. A good example of this would be to blow out the flame of a candle. The candle stops burning when the heat is removed from it by the swiftly moving air. Heat not only increases the likelihood that a fire will start but also helps keep one going by eliminating moisture from fuel sources and warming the surroundings, making it easier for the fire to spread.

Synovial Joints Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones. This space, referred to as the synovial (or joint) cavity, is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage. The entire joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue. This allows movement of the joint as well as resistance to dislocation. Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint. Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints. Since they allow for free movement, synovial joints are classified as diarthroses.

These joints allow very little movement, such as in the spine or ribs. Secondary cartilaginous joints Secondary cartilaginous joints are known as 'symphysis'. These include fibrocartilaginous and hyaline joints, which usually occur at the midline. Some examples of secondary cartilaginous joints in human anatomy would be the manubriosternal joint (between the manubrium and the body of the sternum), intervertebral discs, and the pubic symphysis. Articulating bones at a symphysis are covered with hyaline cartilage and have a thick, fairly compressible pad of fibrocartilage between them. Cartilaginous joints allow little movement, as summarized above. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. \x1b[96m[6] At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap\x1b[0m.

', ""A diastema (pl.: diastemata, from Greek διάστημα, 'space') is a space or gap between two teeth. Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. More colloquially, the condition may be referred to as gap teeth or tooth gap. In humans, the term is most commonly applied to an open space between the upper incisors (front teeth). It happens when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. In humans Causes 1. Oversized Labial Frenulum: Diastema is sometimes caused or exacerbated by the action of a labial frenulum (the tissue connecting the lip to the gum), causing high mucosal attachment and less attached keratinized tissue. This is more prone to recession or by tongue thrusting, which can push the teeth apart. 2. Periodontal Disease: Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, can result in bone loss that supports the teeth. If a person loses enough bone, the teeth can become loose and cause gaps to form. 3. Mesiodens: Mesiodens is an extra tooth that grows behind the front teeth. A mesiodens may push the front teeth apart to make room for itself thus creating a gap between the front teeth. 4. Skeletal discrepancy: Dental skeletal discrepancy can be a cause behind gap teeth. If the upper jaw grows more than the lower jaw, teeth on the upper jaw will have more space to cover thus leaving gaps between them. 5. Proclination: If the front teeth are angled forward, a small gap between them may appear large. This is called proclination; it may be a result of aggressive tongue thrusting. Treatment 1. Determine the cause of the diastema, then treat the cause. "", 'Causes of Gaps Between the Teeth Aside from genetics, there are a few other reasons why gaps in the teeth may develop. For example, if there is a size mismatch between your child’s jaw and teeth size, there may be extra room in the jaw for the teeth to space apart. Additionally, childhood habits like pacifier use or thumb-sucking can also result in gaps between the two front teeth. Another cause of gaps in the teeth is frenum issues. The maxillary labial frenum is a strip of tissue that connects the underside of the upper lip to the gum tissue between the two front teeth. If this strip of tissue is too thick, it can prevent the two front teeth from closing together. Closing Dental Gaps ', 'In this article, we will guide you through how you can close or narrow the gap between your front teeth. What is Midline Diastema? Diastema is the medical term for when you have a gap between two or more teeth. The condition exists in both young and old and can develop between any of your teeth. A midline diastema is the most common type and refers specifically to the gap between your two upper front teeth. What Causes Diastema? Gaps can form for a variety of different reasons. Below you will find the main reasons you might have a gap in between your front teeth: Your teeth are too small for your jawbone – When a person’s teeth are too small for their jawbone, gaps can develop between them. Genetics are in charge of the size of your teeth in relation to your jawbone, which means diastemas can be passed down from generation to generation. ', ""What are gap teeth?Diastema (gap teeth) is a space or gap between two teeth. The gap commonly appears between the two upper front teeth, but spaces can form between any two teeth in the mouth. Gap teeth are a type of malocclusion (misalignment of the teeth and bite). Other common malocclusions include overbites, underbites, crossbites, crooked teeth, crowded teeth and overlapping teeth. Gap teeth causesGap teeth form for many reasons. Whether you've had them since you can remember or you've just started to notice them, be sure to get your gap teeth checked by a qualified doctor.Common causes of gap teethInherited gap teeth If gap teeth run in your family, you may be genetically predisposed to them, too. Natural development Up to 97% of children have spaces between their baby teeth and most close naturally once the permanent teeth grow. Missing, extra or undersized teeth Some children are born with missing/undersized baby or adult teeth, which leaves a gap. In rare cases, extra teeth in the bone can prevent the eruption of other teeth, causing gap teeth. Oversized labial frenum Put your tongue between your front teeth and lip, and then reach the upper part of your mouth. The tissue you feel in the middle is your upper labial frenum. When oversized, this tissue can cause a gap between the front teeth. Jaw and teeth size mismatch An imbalance between the size of the teeth and jaw bones (either too big or too small) can cause a gap in your teeth or teeth crowding. Swallowing reflex problems Some people develop a swallowing reflex known as tongue thrusting where the tongue pushes against the front teeth (instead of the roof of the mouth). This may cause the front teeth to move over time, resulting in gap teeth. "", 'Labial frenum – The tissue that extends from the upper lip to the gums above the upper front teeth, known as the, can cause an oversized gap between the two front teeth.Poor oral habits – This includes smoking or biting into hard objects.Tooth size – The size of the teeth in relation to the jaw, including missing or undersized teeth, can also cause a diastema.Tooth loss – Specifically losing your primary (baby) teeth can leave a gap between your two front ones.Untreated gum disease – This infection of the gums can lead to a gap between your teeth due to gum recession, shifting teeth, or tooth loss.Incorrect swallowing reflex – An incorrect swallowing reflex can cause a gap between the front teeth because it can exert pressure on the front teeth, which can lead to them gradually moving apart. How Are Diastemas Treated? ', 'If the shape, size, and position of your teeth are unusual, the possibility of a gap increases. These teeth can’t get the required pressure and support from each other to prevent them from drifting apart. Missing Teeth The most common occurrence of missing teeth is underdeveloped or missing surrounding teeth of your upper front teeth. They are also called upper lateral incisors. This condition leads to gapped front teeth. Outgrown Labial Frenum The labial frenum is a tissue covering the inside of the upper lip and the gum above the upper front teeth. If this tissue outgrows, it can lead to a gap in teeth. Periodontitis A gap between your teeth can also be the result of periodontitis. It is a kind of gum disease or infection that damages the tissues and teeth bone. As a result, your teeth get loose and form a gap. Improper Swallowing Reflex ', ""Gapped teeth, also called a diastema, cause distinct gaps between the teeth. Diastema is often used for the most common gap in the mouth - the gap between the front two upper teeth. It is estimated that 50% of children under the age of 5 have this type of genetic gap, and it typically closes on its own by the age of 9. Additional Jaw Space Aside from genetics, there are a few other reasons why gaps in the teeth can develop. If there is a size mismatch between your child's jaw and teeth size, there may be extra room in the jaw for the teeth to space apart. Childhood Habits The use of a pacifier or thumb-sucking can also result in gaps between the upper front teeth. Frenum Issues The maxillary labial frenum is a strip of tissue that connects the upper lip's underside to the gum tissue between the two front teeth.

While the most commonly gapped teeth are the two at upper front and center, a gap can occur between any two teeth. There are many potential causes for gapped teeth, including: Teeth that are too small for the jawbone Teeth that are missing or undersized An oversized labial frenum (the piece of tissue that connects the inside of the upper lip to the gum just above the two front teeth) Thumb sucking Bone loss from gum disease When children still have baby teeth, we recommend waiting it out until their permanent teeth come in. But what if the gap is in their permanent teeth? Will the space ever close? In the case of a size mismatch between permanent teeth and jaw size, the bad news is that the gap is likely there to stay without orthodontics. Gaps caused by gum disease will expand over time, so consistent oral hygiene is the best method to prevent those spaces from widening. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastema\nA diastema (pl.: diastemata, from Greek διάστημα, 'space') is a space or gap between two teeth. Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. More colloquially, the condition may be referred to as gap teeth or tooth gap. In humans, the term is most commonly applied to an open space between the upper incisors (front teeth). It happens when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. In humans Causes 1. Oversized Labial Frenulum: Diastema is sometimes caused or exacerbated by the action of a labial frenulum (the tissue connecting the lip to the gum), causing high mucosal attachment and less attached keratinized tissue. This is more prone to recession or by tongue thrusting, which can push the teeth apart. 2. Periodontal Disease: Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, can result in bone loss that supports the teeth. If a person loses enough bone, the teeth can become loose and cause gaps to form. 3. Mesiodens: Mesiodens is an extra tooth that grows behind the front teeth. A mesiodens may push the front teeth apart to make room for itself thus creating a gap between the front teeth. 4. Skeletal discrepancy: Dental skeletal discrepancy can be a cause behind gap teeth. If the upper jaw grows more than the lower jaw, teeth on the upper jaw will have more space to cover thus leaving gaps between them. 5. Proclination: If the front teeth are angled forward, a small gap between them may appear large. This is called proclination; it may be a result of aggressive tongue thrusting. Treatment 1. Determine the cause of the diastema, then treat the cause. "", 'https://severancedental.com/blog/causes-gaps-between-teeth\nCauses of Gaps Between the Teeth Aside from genetics, there are a few other reasons why gaps in the teeth may develop. For example, if there is a size mismatch between your child’s jaw and teeth size, there may be extra room in the jaw for the teeth to space apart. Additionally, childhood habits like pacifier use or thumb-sucking can also result in gaps between the two front teeth. Another cause of gaps in the teeth is frenum issues. The maxillary labial frenum is a strip of tissue that connects the underside of the upper lip to the gum tissue between the two front teeth. If this strip of tissue is too thick, it can prevent the two front teeth from closing together. Closing Dental Gaps ', 'https://www.hampsteadortho.co.uk/blog/how-to-close-gaps-front-teeth/\nIn this article, we will guide you through how you can close or narrow the gap between your front teeth. What is Midline Diastema? Diastema is the medical term for when you have a gap between two or more teeth. The condition exists in both young and old and can develop between any of your teeth. A midline diastema is the most common type and refers specifically to the gap between your two upper front teeth. What Causes Diastema? Gaps can form for a variety of different reasons. Below you will find the main reasons you might have a gap in between your front teeth: Your teeth are too small for your jawbone – When a person’s teeth are too small for their jawbone, gaps can develop between them. Genetics are in charge of the size of your teeth in relation to your jawbone, which means diastemas can be passed down from generation to generation. ', ""https://www.invisalign.com/resources/treatable-cases/gap-teeth\nWhat are gap teeth?Diastema (gap teeth) is a space or gap between two teeth. The gap commonly appears between the two upper front teeth, but spaces can form between any two teeth in the mouth. Gap teeth are a type of malocclusion (misalignment of the teeth and bite). Other common malocclusions include overbites, underbites, crossbites, crooked teeth, crowded teeth and overlapping teeth. Gap teeth causesGap teeth form for many reasons. Whether you've had them since you can remember or you've just started to notice them, be sure to get your gap teeth checked by a qualified doctor.Common causes of gap teethInherited gap teeth If gap teeth run in your family, you may be genetically predisposed to them, too. Natural development Up to 97% of children have spaces between their baby teeth and most close naturally once the permanent teeth grow. Missing, extra or undersized teeth Some children are born with missing/undersized baby or adult teeth, which leaves a gap. In rare cases, extra teeth in the bone can prevent the eruption of other teeth, causing gap teeth. Oversized labial frenum Put your tongue between your front teeth and lip, and then reach the upper part of your mouth. The tissue you feel in the middle is your upper labial frenum. When oversized, this tissue can cause a gap between the front teeth. Jaw and teeth size mismatch An imbalance between the size of the teeth and jaw bones (either too big or too small) can cause a gap in your teeth or teeth crowding. Swallowing reflex problems Some people develop a swallowing reflex known as tongue thrusting where the tongue pushes against the front teeth (instead of the roof of the mouth). This may cause the front teeth to move over time, resulting in gap teeth. "", 'https://www.mycostamesadentist.com/blog/can-a-gap-between-my-two-front-teeth-be-treated/\nLabial frenum – The tissue that extends from the upper lip to the gums above the upper front teeth, known as the, can cause an oversized gap between the two front teeth.Poor oral habits – This includes smoking or biting into hard objects.Tooth size – The size of the teeth in relation to the jaw, including missing or undersized teeth, can also cause a diastema.Tooth loss – Specifically losing your primary (baby) teeth can leave a gap between your two front ones.Untreated gum disease – This infection of the gums can lead to a gap between your teeth due to gum recession, shifting teeth, or tooth loss.Incorrect swallowing reflex – An incorrect swallowing reflex can cause a gap between the front teeth because it can exert pressure on the front teeth, which can lead to them gradually moving apart. How Are Diastemas Treated? ', 'https://www.putnamorthodontics.com/diastema-gap-between-teeth/\nIf the shape, size, and position of your teeth are unusual, the possibility of a gap increases. These teeth can’t get the required pressure and support from each other to prevent them from drifting apart. Missing Teeth The most common occurrence of missing teeth is underdeveloped or missing surrounding teeth of your upper front teeth. They are also called upper lateral incisors. This condition leads to gapped front teeth. Outgrown Labial Frenum The labial frenum is a tissue covering the inside of the upper lip and the gum above the upper front teeth. If this tissue outgrows, it can lead to a gap in teeth. Periodontitis A gap between your teeth can also be the result of periodontitis. It is a kind of gum disease or infection that damages the tissues and teeth bone. As a result, your teeth get loose and form a gap. Improper Swallowing Reflex ', ""https://www.tompkinsdental.com/blog/treatment-options-for-fixing-a-gap-between-teeth\nGapped teeth, also called a diastema, cause distinct gaps between the teeth. Diastema is often used for the most common gap in the mouth - the gap between the front two upper teeth. It is estimated that 50% of children under the age of 5 have this type of genetic gap, and it typically closes on its own by the age of 9. Additional Jaw Space Aside from genetics, there are a few other reasons why gaps in the teeth can develop. If there is a size mismatch between your child's jaw and teeth size, there may be extra room in the jaw for the teeth to space apart. Childhood Habits The use of a pacifier or thumb-sucking can also result in gaps between the upper front teeth.

There is a lot of history behind the Statue of Liberty, as it was a gift from the people of France to the people of United States to raise a monument together to commemorate the independence of the U.S. The statue is a figure of Libertas, which is a robed Roman liberty goddess. Lady Liberty with her right hand holds a torch above her head, and with her left hand carries a tabula ansata with the inscription JULY IV MDCCLXXVI that translates July 4, 1776 in Roman numerals, marking the date of the United States Declaration of Independence. She has a broken shackle and chain that lies at her feet as she is moving forward, in representation of the recent national abolition of slavery. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886, and after this it became a beacon of freedom and as a welcome symbol to the United States seen by immigrants that arrived by sea. Both Bartholdi and Laboulaye thought about how to best represent the idea of American liberty. There was a relevant female icon in American culture that was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom that was widely worshipped in ancient Rome, and more so amongst slaves. And since a Liberty figure adorned most American coins at the time, it seemed the perfect fit to have her represent this iconic monument. Bartholdi required the assistance of an experienced engineer to handle the structural issues that were associated with the design of such a colossal copper structure, and he commissioned Alexandre Gustave Eiffel to design the great iron pylon and secondary skeletal framework. There was some trouble to raise funds to build the Statue of Liberty from both sides of the Atlantic ocean at the time. However, both countries used several ways to raise funds to help build the statue through various forms of entertainment, art exhibits, auctions, and more. Thanks to the combined effort of both countries, the Statue of Liberty was finished in July 1884 and arrive to New York Harbor in June 1885 onboard the French frigate 'Isere.' It had to be reduced to 350 individual pieces and packed in 214 craters to be moved. The pedestal was designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt in 1884, donating his fee to help with the Statue’s funding. It took 4 months to get The Statue reassembled on her new pedestal. President Grover Cleveland oversaw the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in front of thousands of people. The original name of Liberty Island was Bedloe’s Island, and was renamed by the United States Congress in 1956. The Statue of Liberty construction starts in 1865, with Edouard de Laboulaye – a French political intellectual and anti-slavery activist – and his proposal of a statue representing liberty be made for the United States. This structure would be built to honor the celebration of one hundred years of independence and to celebrate the friendship with France. The idea of Edouard was supported by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi and they began designing the statue of 'Liberty Enlightening the World' in 1870. Bartholdi took a trip to the United States to find the ideal spot to place this iconic monument. During his travel he picked Bedloe’s Island, currently known as Liberty Island, as the site for the Statue. Even though the island was quite small, he envisioned it as the 'gateway to America' since it would be visible to every ship that would enter New York Harbor. \x1b[0;30;47m[3] The Statue of Liberty construction actually began in 1876, where French craftsmen and artisans began building the Statue in France with the direction of Bartholdi\x1b[0m.

The head and shoulders were finished in 1876 and displayed at the Paris Universal Exposition.

"", 'https://intrans.iastate.edu/news/why-should-i-care-statue-of-liberty-without-construction-workers/\nTwo of the most well-known people involved in the Statue of Liberty’s construction include Frédéric Bartholdi and Gustave Eiffel (who also constructed the Eiffel Tower). Some argue that the architect, Bartholdi, originally wanted to construct the statue to give to Egypt instead of the United States. But after failing to strike a deal with Egypt, many sources claim that was when Bartholdi thought of giving it to the US. Statue of Liberty’s original construction in Paris, France. Photo from Wikipedia. The US had to raise about $2.5 million (in today’s dollars) to build the foundation/pedestal that the statue stands on. In total, the statue cost about $8 million to construct. After the complete construction of the Statue of Liberty in France, she was deconstructed and packed into 214 large crates to be shipped to the US. After traveling through an extreme 72 hour storm, which nearly capsized the ship and all the crates, they arrived on the coast of New York. ', ""https://www.statueoflibertyticket.org/statue-of-liberty-history/\n\x1b[0;30;47m[1] The Statue of Liberty history according to the National Park Service, begins with an idea presented in the name of the the French people to the United States by the president of the French Anti-Slavery Society, Edouard Rene de Laboulaye, who was and also a prominent and relevant political thinker of his time\x1b[0m. \x1b[0;30;47m[2] It was designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, a sculptor and the metal framework was made by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel\x1b[0m. There is a lot of history behind the Statue of Liberty, as it was a gift from the people of France to the people of United States to raise a monument together to commemorate the independence of the U.S. The statue is a figure of Libertas, which is a robed Roman liberty goddess. Lady Liberty with her right hand holds a torch above her head, and with her left hand carries a tabula ansata with the inscription JULY IV MDCCLXXVI that translates July 4, 1776 in Roman numerals, marking the date of the United States Declaration of Independence. She has a broken shackle and chain that lies at her feet as she is moving forward, in representation of the recent national abolition of slavery. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886, and after this it became a beacon of freedom and as a welcome symbol to the United States seen by immigrants that arrived by sea. Both Bartholdi and Laboulaye thought about how to best represent the idea of American liberty. There was a relevant female icon in American culture that was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom that was widely worshipped in ancient Rome, and more so amongst slaves. And since a Liberty figure adorned most American coins at the time, it seemed the perfect fit to have her represent this iconic monument. Bartholdi required the assistance of an experienced engineer to handle the structural issues that were associated with the design of such a colossal copper structure, and he commissioned Alexandre Gustave Eiffel to design the great iron pylon and secondary skeletal framework. There was some trouble to raise funds to build the Statue of Liberty from both sides of the Atlantic ocean at the time. However, both countries used several ways to raise funds to help build the statue through various forms of entertainment, art exhibits, auctions, and more. Thanks to the combined effort of both countries, the Statue of Liberty was finished in July 1884 and arrive to New York Harbor in June 1885 onboard the French frigate 'Isere.' It had to be reduced to 350 individual pieces and packed in 214 craters to be moved. The pedestal was designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt in 1884, donating his fee to help with the Statue’s funding. It took 4 months to get The Statue reassembled on her new pedestal. President Grover Cleveland oversaw the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in front of thousands of people. The original name of Liberty Island was Bedloe’s Island, and was renamed by the United States Congress in 1956. The Statue of Liberty construction starts in 1865, with Edouard de Laboulaye – a French political intellectual and anti-slavery activist – and his proposal of a statue representing liberty be made for the United States. This structure would be built to honor the celebration of one hundred years of independence and to celebrate the friendship with France. The idea of Edouard was supported by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi and they began designing the statue of 'Liberty Enlightening the World' in 1870. Bartholdi took a trip to the United States to find the ideal spot to place this iconic monument. During his travel he picked Bedloe’s Island, currently known as Liberty Island, as the site for the Statue. Even though the island was quite small, he envisioned it as the 'gateway to America' since it would be visible to every ship that would enter New York Harbor. \x1b[0;30;47m[3] The Statue of Liberty construction actually began in 1876, where French craftsmen and artisans began building the Statue in France with the direction of Bartholdi\x1b[0m. The Statue was completed by pieces in both countries in the span of 10 years. The bearing arm that holds the torch was finished that year and was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The head and shoulders were finished in 1876 and displayed at the Paris Universal Exposition. The Statue of Liberty construction finished in Paris between the years 1881 and 1884, and on 1884 the construction of the pedestal started in the United States.

The Brothers Grimm and other later authors added male heroes who save Red Riding Hood.[5][8] Charles Perrault[change | change source] The story was first written and published in a book from 1697 by the French writer Charles Perrault. The name of the book, in English, is Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals: Tales of Mother Goose. The story is called The Little Red Cap (Le Petit Chaperon Rouge).[9] Perrault's version of the tale is the original printed version, but it is likely based on an older oral tradition. It is uncertain if Perrault knew a folk tale from the south of France about a girl who cleverly escapes a werewolf occupying her grandmother's bed.[10] Perrault wanted to make a strong point about wise and foolish behaviour. He wanted to show that a beautiful young woman was in danger of having men with bad morals try to trick her into wrong behaviour.[5] In Perrault's story the girl is eaten and there is no happy ending.[11] Other versions[change | change source] The story has been changed many times in the centuries following its publication. It is a little different from the way that the Brothers Grimm tell it.[12] In their version, a huntsman slays the child-devouring wolf. He then frees the heroine from the animal's stomach.

"", 'And what we’ve wanted stories to teach children has changed over time. Little Red Riding Hood is thought to have originated in the 17th century. According to Hannah Newton, author of The Sick Child in Early Modern England, 1580–1720, in 17th century England, almost one-third of young people died before they were 15 years old. And ‘Rather than shielding their offspring from these foreboding facts, parents encouraged their children to think about their own mortality.’ (source) Indeed, in tale after tale, death or the possibility of death makes a recurring appearance. Little Red Riding Hood is an instructive tale that warns about threats to one’s own mortality. Do not talk to strangers — or you may die. Beware of wolves — or you may die. Similarly, with The Gingerbread Man. Do not unthinkingly place your trust in strangers, even if they appear to be trying to help you — or you may die. Death was a significant and real threat, so many of these stories provided instruction as to how to avoid death.

The reference is used to state that the names of things do not affect what they really are. This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language. Juliet compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he were not named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's love. This states that if he were not Romeo, then he would not be a Montague and she would be able to marry him without hindrances. Origin In the famous speech of Act II, Scene II of the play, the line is said by Juliet in reference to Romeo's house: Montague. The line implies that his name (and thus his family's feud with Juliet's family) means nothing and they should be together. Juliet: O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Although it is one of the most famous quotes from the work of Shakespeare, no printing in Shakespeare's lifetime presents the text in the form known to modern readers: it is a skillful amalgam assembled by Edmond Malone, an editor in the eighteenth century. Romeo and Juliet was published twice, in two very different versions. The first version of 1597, named 'Q1', is believed to have been an unauthorised pirate copy or bad quarto provided to the printer by actors off the books: a memorial reconstruction. It may also, separately, represent a version of the play improved and trimmed after rehearsals for more dramatic impact. It runs: ’Tis but thy name that is mine enemy: What's Montague? It is not hand nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part. What's in a name? That which we call a rose, By any other name would smell as sweet. "", ""[4] We call it by any other name. [5] We call it a rose by any other name. (I don’t think it’s a possible structure) Question: What’s the function of 'by any other name' in [1]? An adverbial of 'call', a modifier of a nominal clause, or neither? Background: I‘ve noticed that a lot people take 'by any other name' in [1] an adverbial of 'call', but I don’t think so. If 'by any other name' in [1] is an adverbial of 'call', its logic would be like [5], but as far as I know, [3] and [4] are both possible structures while [5] is not. A closer look at [2] would also reveal that 'by any other name' in [1] modifies a nominal clause, namely, 'that which we call a rose'. The following is my analysis: that which we call a rose = what we call a rose = the thing we (normally) call a rose by any other name = called by any other name = which we now call by any other name "", 'Common names for plants might be different in different parts of the country.

She is a highly intelligent girl and this monologue is one of the most profound observations in all of Shakespeare. This principle of things being what they are, no matter what name you give them is at the heart of the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. The names Montague and Capulet are extremely important in the world of this play, but Juliet cuts through that by suggesting that whichever one of those you are is unimportant. Whether you are called Montague or Capulet you are still the same person, and that’s what matters. ‘A rose by any other name’ quote in context ', 'The action hurtles from their initial encounter to their tragic deaths, something that would not have happened were it not for this ancient feud connected with the names of people bearing the names of Montague and Capulet.

But in the situation of these two unfortunate young people, it is not the two young people but their names that prove to be more important. Their parents, the heads of the two families, come to understand that when they see what their feud, based on their names, has led to, and they resolve to end it.

Members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms and are considered for reelection every even year. Senators however, serve six-year terms and elections to the Senate are staggered over even years so that only about 1/3 of the Senate is up for reelection during any election.How many members of Congress come from each state? ', 'In the House of Representatives, the majority party holds significant power to draft chamber rules and schedule bills to reach the floor for debate and voting. In most cases, House rules will limit debate so that important legislation can be passed during one legislative business day.In the Senate however, the majority has the power to schedule when various bills come to the floor for voting but a single Senator can slow legislation from coming to the floor for a vote. Since debate in the Senate is not concluded until 60 senators vote for a cloture motion to approve a bill for consideration, the majority must also coordinate with the minority part to set the rules for debate on legislation. Under this system, legislation can be debated for one or two weeks on the Senate floor alone. Why does Congress use the committee system? Congress deals with a broad variety of different policy issues and it is more efficient to have work done at the committee level than on the House or Senate floor. In addition, this system allows members to gain expertise in specific issue areas they are interested in.

Members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms and are considered for reelection every even year. Senators however, serve six-year terms and elections to the Senate are staggered over even years so that only about 1/3 of the Senate is up for reelection during any election.How many members of Congress come from each state? ', 'http://walberg.house.gov/about/how-congress-works\nIn the House of Representatives, the majority party holds significant power to draft chamber rules and schedule bills to reach the floor for debate and voting. In most cases, House rules will limit debate so that important legislation can be passed during one legislative business day.In the Senate however, the majority has the power to schedule when various bills come to the floor for voting but a single Senator can slow legislation from coming to the floor for a vote. Since debate in the Senate is not concluded until 60 senators vote for a cloture motion to approve a bill for consideration, the majority must also coordinate with the minority part to set the rules for debate on legislation. Under this system, legislation can be debated for one or two weeks on the Senate floor alone. Why does Congress use the committee system? Congress deals with a broad variety of different policy issues and it is more efficient to have work done at the committee level than on the House or Senate floor. In addition, this system allows members to gain expertise in specific issue areas they are interested in. Throughout history, committees have been created to address particular issues before Congress. The House has 23 committees while the Senate has a total of 20 committees.How does a bill become a law?

They recorded 14 takes with George Harrison on guitar, John Lennon on organ, Paul McCartney on bass guitar, and Ringo Starr on drums.The song was left alone until 3 September, when a series of overdubs were added – the first on Abbey Road’s new eight-track recording equipment. Harrison worked alone, spending the entire eight-hour session trying to record a backwards guitar solo.On 5 September Harrison recorded two lead vocal parts, and maracas, drums and lead guitar were also added. However, upon hearing a playback of the recording so far, he decided to scrap it and begin afresh.The remake was started that same day.

The visit had allowed Harrison to re-engage with the guitar as his primary instrument, after focusing on the Indian sitar for the previous two years, and also marked the start of a prolific period for him as a songwriter. Inspiration for the song came to him when he was visiting his parents in Warrington, Cheshire, and he began reading the I Ching, or 'The Book of Changes'. As Harrison put it, '[the book] seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else, as opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental.' Embracing this idea of relativism, he committed to writing a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a book, which happened to be 'gently weeps'. Harrison continued to work on the lyrics after this initial writing session. "", ""'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' was one of the few Beatles compositions from early 1968 that changed markedly from demo form to the official recording. Harrison's demos suggest the influence of folk music, yet the Beatles' version is in the heavy rock style typical of much of the band's late 1960s work. While noting the importance of Harrison's return to the guitar during this period, Gould describes the song as 'virtually a declaration of his recommitment to rock'. The song as originally issued by the Beatles is in the key of A minor, changing to A major over the bridges. Aside from the intro, the composition is structured into two rounds of verse and bridge, with an instrumental passage extending the second of these verse sections, followed by a final verse and a long instrumental passage that fades out on the released recording. All the sections consist of an even sixteen bars or measures, which are divided into four phrases. "", ""'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' follows in a lyrical tradition established by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Bo Diddley, whereby emotions and actions are attributed to a musical instrument. According to an NME reviewer, writing in 1998, the song conveys 'serious concern' for the Beatles' 'dwindling esprit de corps'. Harrison biographer Joshua Greene says that its message reflects the pessimism encouraged by world events throughout 1968, such as the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy in the United States, and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.[nb 2] Allison writes that the lyrics represent the 'antithesis of spiritual triumphalism', in which Harrison 'mourns because love has not conquered all'. Recording Early attempts and basic track The Beatles recorded 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' several times during the sessions for their self-titled double album, also known as 'the White Album'. The recording sessions, which began in late May 1968, were characterised by a lack of cooperation among the four band members, and by what Lennon's bandmates regarded as the overly intrusive presence of his new romantic partner, Yoko Ono. In this atmosphere, Harrison had initially been reluctant to present his new compositions to the group. Take 1 on 25 July – the version later issued on Anthology 3 – was a solo performance by Harrison, playing his Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar, with an overdubbed harmonium part.[nb 3] "", ""'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' became a staple of US rock radio during the early 1970s, on a par with songs such as 'Layla' by Clapton's short-lived band Derek and the Dominos, Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven' and the Who's 'Won't Get Fooled Again'. In 1973, it appeared on the Beatles' double album compilation 1967–1970, as one of only three tracks representing the White Album. Capitol Records included it on The Best of George Harrison in 1976; a year before this, Harrison released a sequel to the song, titled 'This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)', which also served as the final single issued by Apple in its original incarnation. The Beatles' recording appeared on the soundtrack to Withnail and I, a 1987 comedy film set in late-1960s London and produced by Harrison's company HandMade Films. "", ""Harrison played 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' at every one of his rare concerts as a solo artist. Writing for Mojo in 2003, Ashley Kahn attributed the track's 'classic' status to its evocation of 'a band falling out of harmony' and, with regard to the enduring musical bond between Harrison and Clapton, its standing as 'their song'. At Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh, held at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 August 1971, Clapton performed the song on a Gibson Byrdland, a hollow-body guitar more suited to jazz or country music than rock. He later said that this was a poor decision and, as with his substandard playing at the event, one that was indicative of his descent into heroin addiction. In his entry for The Concert for Bangladesh in the book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon nevertheless describes Clapton and Harrison's interplay as 'one of the more thrilling two-man guitar explorations in rock', adding: 'As they finish each other's thoughts, the two extend and amplify the song's intent: You haven't heard the full gamut of gentle (and not so) guitar weeping until you've heard this.'[nb 8] "", ""American musician Todd Rundgren covered 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' for the 2003 album Songs from the Material World: A Tribute to George Harrison. Rundgren said of his contribution to the multi-artist tribute: '[Before the Beatles], I'd never heard the term 'lead guitarist.' George created the job description for my first paying gig, the vocation that I'm still lucky enough to practice today …' Johnny Loftus of AllMusic views the recording as one of the collection's highlights, saying that Rundgren 'effortlessly replicates the grandeur' of the Beatles' track. As his personal tribute to Harrison, Peter Frampton released a version of the song on his 2003 album Now. In 2004, when Harrison was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' was played in tribute by a large band that included Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Steve Winwood, Marc Mann, Dhani Harrison, Prince and Steve Ferrone. The performance concluded with a highly acclaimed extended guitar solo by Prince, who was also being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Among other cover versions, the song has also been recorded by guitarists such as Marc Ribot, Phish and Charlie Byrd, and on ukulele by Jake Shimabukuro. Toto did a cover version for their album Through the Looking Glass and in a live performance in Live in Amsterdam. Santana did a cover for his twentieth album Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time, in 2010, featuring singer India Arie and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Released as a single, it charted on Billboard's Adult Contemporary. A recording of the song by Regina Spektor appears in the 2016 film Kubo and the Two Strings.

Left unheard until its 1996 release on Anthology 3, the earliest versions of the song were tender, George Harrison singing to his own acoustic guitar accompaniment, backed only by Paul McCartney on harmonium. A touching version of the song, it was nonetheless not what George was after, and would be drastically remade – not once, but twice – before he was satisfied.

Left unheard until its 1996 release on Anthology 3, the earliest versions of the song were tender, George Harrison singing to his own acoustic guitar accompaniment, backed only by Paul McCartney on harmonium. A touching version of the song, it was nonetheless not what George was after, and would be drastically remade – not once, but twice – before he was satisfied. The lyrics would also go through a number of changes before the final version, with entire verses being lost along the way. The super deluxe edition of The Beatles’ 'White Album' is out now.

Along with the change in networks and the transition to color, Tim Considine (who had earlier worked with Fred MacMurray on The Shaggy Dog), playing eldest son Mike, had chosen not to renew his contract due to a clash with executive producer Don Fedderson over Considine's wish to direct but not co-star in the series. (Considine did, however, direct one of the last black-and-white episodes for ABC.) In an August 1989 interview on the Pat Sajak Show, he explained that he was also devoted to car racing, which his contract forbade. His character was written out, along with Meredith MacRae, who had played his fiancée Sally, in a wedding episode that was the premiere of the 1965–1966 season on CBS. After this episode, Mike is mentioned briefly in only four succeeding episodes (including the one in which the family adopts Ernie) and is never seen again, even at Robbie's or Steve's weddings. (Steve explains briefly in one of these episodes that he has another son who 'lives away from home'.) In the episode 'Steve and the Huntress' (first aired January 27, 1966), Mike is specifically mentioned as teaching at a college. MacRae joined Petticoat Junction the following year, the last of three actresses to play Billie Jo Bradley. "", ""While the three sons were always central to the storyline, several major changes took place by the late 1960s. In the spring of 1967, the series' ratings began to sag, and it finished its seventh season in 31st place in the Nielsen ratings. It was decided that the 1967–1968 season would bring the program not only a new time slot but also new storylines to spice up the ratings. In the fall of 1967, CBS moved My Three Sons to Saturday at 8:30 pm ET. In the season premiere episode, 'Moving Day', the Douglas family and Uncle Charley relocate from the fictional Midwestern town of Bryant Park to Los Angeles, California. Robbie (Don Grady) marries his girlfriend Katie Miller. Katie is played by Tina Cole, who had appeared in different roles on three previous episodes: 'House For Sale' from the fourth season (February 13, 1964), 'The Coffee House Set' from the fifth season (November 19, 1964), and 'Robbie and the Little Stranger' from the sixth season (February 17, 1966). At the end of the 1967–1968 season, the ratings had improved from the previous year with the series placing at 24th in the Nielsens. The following season, the newlyweds discover that Katie is pregnant and she gives birth to triplets named Robert, Steven, and Charles. Originally played by sets of uncredited twins, the boys were later played uncredited by Guy, Gunnar, and Garth Swanson; and in the last two seasons by Michael, Daniel, and Joseph Todd.

It revolved around suburban patriarch, Steve Douglas, and his three sons. Steve was a widower, trying to do his best to raise his sons without the help of a spouse. The sons did have their gruff but lovable Uncle Charlie, around to clean, cook, and give them his sage guidance.It was fun to see the three boys, always get into one misadventure after another. Dad Steve, was always patient with his son's misgivings. Steve was the kind of father that most kids would love to have. He was at least as credible a father-figure as Ward Cleaver was, on Leave It To Beaver.I'll always fondly remember this heartwarming show. It's not in syndication anymore, but you can watch it on DVD now. It's among the best of the 60s family sitcoms. 10 out of 13 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink 7/10 Started real good, then... Australian131 December 2023 "", ""My Three Sons had an impressive twelve year run, and no show can survive that long without going through several changes, including cast. The show went through three phases with (1) the black and white years, (2) then when the first son leaves to be replaced by Ernie, (3) then when Steve marries Barbara. The best years were when the cast included Robbie, Chip and Ernie before they started having serious relationships with women. My favorite episode is when Robbie has two dates, and tries to separately entertain both of them at the same restaurant without either being wise to his scheme. As the boys got older and more mature, it wasn't as fun. KATIE WAS DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS, so it wasn't too bad when Robbie settled down. The show should have taken a new title after Steve marries Barbara, because the whole dynamic changed: no more sons, and the household is now half men and half women. I think the Barbara years is when the show became too sappy. "", ""My Three Sons survived many potential Shark jumps, but try as it did, the show couldn't overcome the arrival of that frumpy, sullen, annoying kid, Dodie. The show withstood the departure of Mike, the coolest son, along with his hottie wife, Sally (played by Meredith MacCrae, who would go on to play Billy Jo Bradley on Petticoat Junction); the adoption of supernerd Ernie; the marriage of Robbie and Katie (who's beauty made up for the loss of Sally); the birth of Robbie and Katie's triplets; and even the introduction of Steve's first serious love interest, Barbara. When Barbara first spoke of having a little girl from a previous marriage, many viewers must of thought, 'aahh, a cute, charming little girl to perk things up at the Douglas house'. No such luck. Depressing and startlingly disheveled, Dodie (who bore no resemblance to her good looking mother) showed up like the angel of death - - you knew the show didn't have much time left after that. What's amazing is that the show did hold on for two more years, and introduced still another woman to the Douglas mix - - Chip's attractive but syrupy wife, Polly. Polly was cute, alright, but she simply wasn't enough to overcome the human downer that was Dodie. Dodie ranks right up there with every other child actor brought on an aging show in it's final year(s) (ala the Brady Bunch's Oliver, All in the Family's Steffi, The Partridge Family's Ricky, etc.) to help it, only to seal its doom. I hope the actress who played her moved on to better things (with a start like that, it could only get better!). "", ""This is one of my favorite television shows from my childhood. But when Robby left...that was the end of the show for me. Katie was just never the same. In a certain MY THREE SONS later episode (that I recall from it's initial run), Fred MacMurray acknowledges having ONLY three sons, Robbie, Chip, and Ernie, with not even a hint that Mike may have existed. (The same went for HAPPY DAYS when Chuck went unacknowledged when bringing up family members.) Maybe the then writers were too young to recall. "", ""MY THREE SONS was the classic CBS sitcom in which widower Fred MacMurray raised, well actually, 4 sons, because after Tim Considine left the show, Steve Douglas adopted Ernie, played by Barry Livingston, who turned out to be quite the charmer. As a matter of fact, my favorite episodes of the show were the ones that were about Ernie. Great character. The show, however, did jump the shark when Steve remarried to Beverly Garland's character. Steve had raised those boys by himself all those years with help from no one but Charley and Bub. The addition of Beverly Garland to the cast was superfluous and unnecessary. "", ""And it's sad that while Fergus appeared in the black & white era too, no one will recall that -- and instead use the character to tear down the color seasons. ARRRRRRRGH! UNFAIR Bias anyone? ThomasE03-07-2014, 04:03 PMI fondly remember the B&W episodes and prefer that era. That was 'My Three Sons.' I've seen some eps featuring Beverly Garland playing Steve's wife & Ernie as 4th son and it like an alternate universe of this once vibrant show. I must say that I loved how the show evolved over the 12 year run. I grew up a kid in the 80's and grew up watching the black and white eps on Nick at Nite and the color eps from the 70's. As a kid, I thought that the show was off the air for six years and then came back for new episodes. LOL. (NAN Jumped from 1965 to 1971).

Along with the change in networks and the transition to color, Tim Considine (who had earlier worked with Fred MacMurray on The Shaggy Dog), playing eldest son Mike, had chosen not to renew his contract due to a clash with executive producer Don Fedderson over Considine's wish to direct but not co-star in the series. (Considine did, however, direct one of the last black-and-white episodes for ABC.) In an August 1989 interview on the Pat Sajak Show, he explained that he was also devoted to car racing, which his contract forbade. His character was written out, along with Meredith MacRae, who had played his fiancée Sally, in a wedding episode that was the premiere of the 1965–1966 season on CBS. After this episode, Mike is mentioned briefly in only four succeeding episodes (including the one in which the family adopts Ernie) and is never seen again, even at Robbie's or Steve's weddings. (Steve explains briefly in one of these episodes that he has another son who 'lives away from home'.) In the episode 'Steve and the Huntress' (first aired January 27, 1966), Mike is specifically mentioned as teaching at a college. MacRae joined Petticoat Junction the following year, the last of three actresses to play Billie Jo Bradley. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Three_Sons\nWhile the three sons were always central to the storyline, several major changes took place by the late 1960s. In the spring of 1967, the series' ratings began to sag, and it finished its seventh season in 31st place in the Nielsen ratings. It was decided that the 1967–1968 season would bring the program not only a new time slot but also new storylines to spice up the ratings. In the fall of 1967, CBS moved My Three Sons to Saturday at 8:30 pm ET. In the season premiere episode, 'Moving Day', the Douglas family and Uncle Charley relocate from the fictional Midwestern town of Bryant Park to Los Angeles, California. Robbie (Don Grady) marries his girlfriend Katie Miller. Katie is played by Tina Cole, who had appeared in different roles on three previous episodes: 'House For Sale' from the fourth season (February 13, 1964), 'The Coffee House Set' from the fifth season (November 19, 1964), and 'Robbie and the Little Stranger' from the sixth season (February 17, 1966). At the end of the 1967–1968 season, the ratings had improved from the previous year with the series placing at 24th in the Nielsens. The following season, the newlyweds discover that Katie is pregnant and she gives birth to triplets named Robert, Steven, and Charles. Originally played by sets of uncredited twins, the boys were later played uncredited by Guy, Gunnar, and Garth Swanson; and in the last two seasons by Michael, Daniel, and Joseph Todd. "", 'https://travsd.wordpress.com/2018/08/30/the-rising-and-setting-of-my-three-sons/\nMy Three Sons moved to CBS for the 1965-66 season. At this stage the show was in color. The setting was moved from the midwest to Los Angeles. Mike had moved out to marry his fiance (who’d been played by Meredith MacRae) and was essentially written out of the series as though he’d never existed. A third son, the bespectacled Ernie, played by Barry Livingston, Stanley’s brother) was adopted to justify the show’s name. And the ailing William Frawley was replaced by crusty old William Demarest as Uncle Charlie, who sort of became a high point of the show, amping up the male energy considerably. This may be why there were even more changes as the series went on: it got all MUSHY! In 1967 the extremely attractive Tina Cole was brought in to play Robbie’s girlfriend (then wife) Katie and they proceeded to have triplets — three more sons (why has no one made THAT show? Actually they did. There was a pilot called Three of a Kind made in 1971 but it wasn’t picked up). \x1b[95m[1] In 1969 the lovely Beverly Garland was brought in to be Steve’s new wife Barbara\x1b[0m, accompanied by her young daughter, the monstrous Dodie (Dawn Lyn). But that’s not all! In 1970, Ronne Troup (Bobby Troup’s daughter; Julie London’s stepdaughter) was brought in to play Polly, Chips’ girlfriend (then wife). Basically they married off everybody but the dog. At this stage the show ought to have been renamed My Three Sons, Their Wives, My Three Grandsons, My Second Wife, and My Stepdaughter! ', ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053525/reviews/\nMy Three Sons, was one of many 60s family sitcoms. It revolved around suburban patriarch, Steve Douglas, and his three sons. Steve was a widower, trying to do his best to raise his sons without the help of a spouse. The sons did have their gruff but lovable Uncle Charlie, around to clean, cook, and give them his sage guidance.It was fun to see the three boys, always get into one misadventure after another. Dad Steve, was always patient with his son's misgivings. Steve was the kind of father that most kids would love to have. He was at least as credible a father-figure as Ward Cleaver was, on Leave It To Beaver.I'll always fondly remember this heartwarming show. It's not in syndication anymore, but you can watch it on DVD now. It's among the best of the 60s family sitcoms. 10 out of 13 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink 7/10 Started real good, then... Australian131 December 2023 "", ""https://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-317191.html\nMy Three Sons had an impressive twelve year run, and no show can survive that long without going through several changes, including cast. The show went through three phases with (1) the black and white years, (2) then when the first son leaves to be replaced by Ernie, (3) then when Steve marries Barbara. The best years were when the cast included Robbie, Chip and Ernie before they started having serious relationships with women. My favorite episode is when Robbie has two dates, and tries to separately entertain both of them at the same restaurant without either being wise to his scheme. As the boys got older and more mature, it wasn't as fun. KATIE WAS DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS, so it wasn't too bad when Robbie settled down. The show should have taken a new title after Steve marries Barbara, because the whole dynamic changed: no more sons, and the household is now half men and half women. I think the Barbara years is when the show became too sappy. "", ""https://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-317191.html\nMy Three Sons survived many potential Shark jumps, but try as it did, the show couldn't overcome the arrival of that frumpy, sullen, annoying kid, Dodie. The show withstood the departure of Mike, the coolest son, along with his hottie wife, Sally (played by Meredith MacCrae, who would go on to play Billy Jo Bradley on Petticoat Junction); the adoption of supernerd Ernie; the marriage of Robbie and Katie (who's beauty made up for the loss of Sally); the birth of Robbie and Katie's triplets; and even the introduction of Steve's first serious love interest, Barbara. When Barbara first spoke of having a little girl from a previous marriage, many viewers must of thought, 'aahh, a cute, charming little girl to perk things up at the Douglas house'. No such luck. Depressing and startlingly disheveled, Dodie (who bore no resemblance to her good looking mother) showed up like the angel of death - - you knew the show didn't have much time left after that. What's amazing is that the show did hold on for two more years, and introduced still another woman to the Douglas mix - - Chip's attractive but syrupy wife, Polly. Polly was cute, alright, but she simply wasn't enough to overcome the human downer that was Dodie. Dodie ranks right up there with every other child actor brought on an aging show in it's final year(s) (ala the Brady Bunch's Oliver, All in the Family's Steffi, The Partridge Family's Ricky, etc.) to help it, only to seal its doom. I hope the actress who played her moved on to better things (with a start like that, it could only get better!). "", ""https://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-317191.html\nThis is one of my favorite television shows from my childhood. But when Robby left...that was the end of the show for me. Katie was just never the same. In a certain MY THREE SONS later episode (that I recall from it's initial run), Fred MacMurray acknowledges having ONLY three sons, Robbie, Chip, and Ernie, with not even a hint that Mike may have existed. (The same went for HAPPY DAYS when Chuck went unacknowledged when bringing up family members.) Maybe the then writers were too young to recall. "", ""https://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-317191.html\nMY THREE SONS was the classic CBS sitcom in which widower Fred MacMurray raised, well actually, 4 sons, because after Tim Considine left the show, Steve Douglas adopted Ernie, played by Barry Livingston, who turned out to be quite the charmer. As a matter of fact, my favorite episodes of the show were the ones that were about Ernie. Great character. The show, however, did jump the shark when Steve remarried to Beverly Garland's character. Steve had raised those boys by himself all those years with help from no one but Charley and Bub. The addition of Beverly Garland to the cast was superfluous and unnecessary. "", ""https://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-317191.html\nAnd it's sad that while Fergus appeared in the black & white era too, no one will recall that -- and instead use the character to tear down the color seasons. ARRRRRRRGH! UNFAIR Bias anyone? ThomasE03-07-2014, 04:03 PMI fondly remember the B&W episodes and prefer that era. That was 'My Three Sons.' I've seen some eps featuring Beverly Garland playing Steve's wife & Ernie as 4th son and it like an alternate universe of this once vibrant show. I must say that I loved how the show evolved over the 12 year run. I grew up a kid in the 80's and grew up watching the black and white eps on Nick at Nite and the color eps from the 70's. As a kid, I thought that the show was off the air for six years and then came back for new episodes. LOL. (NAN Jumped from 1965 to 1971). During the summer of 1991, TBS totally revised their schedule and added My Three Sons to the schedule airing at 06:35am. I thought that I'd be seeing black and white shows but TBS started with color episodes.

It is a chemical reaction in which you mix two solutions of two ionic substances and a solid ionic substance (a precipitate) forms. For example, precipitation occurs when a part of the atmosphere saturates itself with water vapour and when the right temperature comes it condenses and precipitates.

Raindrop When water droplets combine each other to form bigger water droplets and when water droplets freeze onto a crystal of ice, this process is known as coalescence. The rate of fall of small droplets is considered to be negligible, that is the reason behind the clouds not falling from the sky.

Snowflakes ', ""In meteorology, any result of atmospheric water vapour condensation that comes under cloud gravity is precipitation. The main types of precipitation include drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, ice pellets, graupel, and hail. Precipitation happens when water vapour (reaching 100 percent relative humidity) saturates a portion of the atmosphere so that the water condenses and ‘precipitates’ or falls. Fog and mist are thus not precipitation, but colloids, since the vapour of water does not condense enough to precipitate. Two processes may contribute to air being saturated, likely working together: cooling the air or adding water vapour to the air. As smaller droplets coalesce through collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud, precipitation forms. Quick, heavy bursts of rain are called 'showers' in scattered areas. Precipitation is a significant component of the cycle of water and is responsible for the accumulation of much of the planet’s fresh water. Per year, about 505,000 km3 (121,000 mi3) of water falls as precipitation, 398,000 km3 (95,000 cu mi) of it over the oceans.

Takes Many Shapes Rain and snow are probably the most well known types of precipitation, but there are others. The temperature of the cloud and the air between the cloud and the ground create different kinds of precipitation. Rain: Rain made of liquid water droplets falls when temperatures in the air and at the surface are above freezing (32°F, 0°C). Rain can start as water droplets or ice crystals in a cloud but always falls as liquid water. Hail: The balls of ice that fall from clouds and can even put dents in cars are known as hail.

The hailstones grow as more water droplets freeze onto them and eventually fall to the ground. ', ""During the winter, there are four main precipitation types that meteorologists forecast. They are rain, freezing rain, sleet, and of course snow. Generally, the precipitation type that reaches the ground is dependent on how 'deep' the freezing layer is above.  In other words, how high in the atmosphere do you have to go to get below 32 degrees.  If the entire layer of the atmosphere is above 32°F, you get rain.  If it is entirely below freezing (usually all the way to the ground), you will see snow.  However, an intruding warm layer in between is where we need to deal with the other two precipitation types. If the warm layer is shallow, the snow will melt on its way down to the surface, but as the 'newly melted' now raindrops fall into a layer of cold air closer to the surface, they refreeze into ice pellets commonly known as sleet. These little balls of ice tend to bounce off many surfaces (like your car windshield) making a distinct 'pinging' sound. A thicker warm layer, however, will cause these newly melted raindrops to remain unfrozen and will not have time to refreeze into sleet before reaching the ground. The biggest concern then becomes the temperature of the surface.  If it is at or below 32 degrees, the raindrop will freeze on contact and create a layer of ice.  This is known as freezing rain and can result in icing on roads, trees, buildings, electrical lines, and cars.  Freezing rain is one of the most hazardous types of precipitation during the winter months.  Below is a diagram of how this whole process works. "", ""Of course, not all precipitation falls as rain. A fair amount of the world's precipitation falls as snow or some other solid water form. Actually, outside the tropical regions, it is likely that the much of the precipitation begins in the solid form and only becomes liquid rain when it melts while falling through air with temperatures above freezing. Most people call almost any frozen form of precipitation, other than hail or ice pellets, a snowflake. But meteorologists are a bit more fussy. Technically the term snowflake refers to an assemblage of individual snow crystals that have bumped together and remain joined during their fall. Snowflakes typically fall when air temperatures near the earth's surface are not far from the freezing mark. Snow crystals adhere to each other better at these temperatures. At very cold temperatures, snowflakes are uncommon and we see mostly snow crystals during a snow fall.

But not all clouds will produce raindrops or snowflakes \x97 many are so short-lived and small that there are no opportunities for precipitation mechanisms to start. There are two theories that explain how minute cloud droplets develop into precipitation. 1. The Bergeron-Findeisen ice-crystal mechanism If parcels of air are uplifted to a sufficient height in the troposphere, the dew point temperature will be very low, and minute ice crystals will start to form. The supercooled water droplets will also freeze on contact with these ice nuclei. The ice crystals subsequently combine to form larger flakes which attract more supercooled droplets. This process continues until the flakes fall back towards the ground. As they fall through the warmer layers of air, the ice particles melt to form raindrops.

Ice storms occur when particles falling from the cloud melt and then fall through a layer of below-freezing air near the ground. The two precipitation types most common during ice storms are freezing rain and sleet. Freezing rain forms when a very thin layer of cold air near the surface causes melted precipitation (raindrops) to become supercooled – a condition in which the drops remain in the liquid state even though the temperature of the liquid is below freezing. Such supercooled raindrops then freeze on contact with exposed objects on the ground. Freezing rain covers everything in a sheet of ice, creating shimmering landscapes.

"", 'The present-day distribution of oxygen in the internal deep ocean is thus determined by a complicated and not fully understood interplay of water circulation and bio\xadlogical productivity, which leads to oxygen consumption in the ocean’s interior. Extensive measurements have shown that the highest oxygen concentrations are found at high latitudes, where the ocean is cold, especially well-mixed and ventilated. The mid-latitudes, by contrast, especially on the western coasts of the continents, are characterized by marked oxygen-deficient zones. The oxygen supply here is very weak due to the sluggish water circulation, and this is further compounded by \xadelevated oxygen consumption due to high biological productivity. This leads to a situation where the oxygen is almost completely depleted in the depth range between 100 and 1000 metres. This situation is also observed in the northern Indian Ocean in the area of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. ', 'Globally, oceans have lost around 2% of dissolved oxygen since the 1950s and are expected to lose about 3–4% by the year 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), though the scale of effect is predicted to vary regionally. Much of the oxygen loss is concentrated in the upper 1000m where species richness and abundance is highest. Even slight overall reductions in the levels of oxygen dissolved in the oceans can induce oxygen stress in marine organisms by depriving them of an adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level (termed hypoxia). The loss of oxygen in the ocean has two major causes: Ocean warming-driven deoxygenation: Warmer ocean water holds less oxygen and is more buoyant than cooler water. This leads to reduced mixing of oxygenated water near the surface with deeper waters, which naturally contain less oxygen. Warmer water also raises oxygen demand from living organisms. As a result, less oxygen is available for marine life. ', 'Virtually all the ocean’s food provisioning ecosystem services for humans require oxygen to support organism growth and production. Oxygen is necessary to sustain the life of all the fishes and invertebrates, and deoxygenation is already causing measurable declines of fish species. Some of the ocean’s most productive biomes, supporting one fifth of the world’s wild marine fish harvest, are formed by ocean currents that bring nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor water to coasts that line the eastern edges of the world’s ocean basins. As naturally oxygen-poor systems, these areas are particularly vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation, and such effects may ripple out and affect hundreds of millions of people. Degraded habitats caused by climate change-driven hypoxia and increased algal blooms may lead to reduced catches for fisheries and possible collapse of regional stocks.

However, for half the time life has existed on Earth, there was no oxygen present, and for the first 1.5 billion years, it is not known how these systems worked, says University of Connecticut geoscientist Pieter Visscher, lead author of the study. A breakthrough happened when the research team discovered active microbial mats in the harsh conditions of Laguna La Brava in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The mats present an otherworldly set of conditions, like those of early Earth. They are in a unique environment that leaves them in a permanent oxygen-free state at high altitude. There they're exposed to wild, daily temperature swings, and high ultraviolet light conditions. "", 'https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ocean-oxygen.html\nIt’s important to remember that although \x1b[96m[2] the ocean produces at least 50% of the oxygen on Earth\x1b[0m, roughly the same amount is consumed by marine life. Like animals on land, marine animals use oxygen to breathe, and both plants and animals use oxygen for cellular respiration. Oxygen is also consumed when dead plants and animals decay in the ocean. There is also oxygen in the atmosphere which has accumulated over hundreds of millions of years. As land animals, most of the oxygen humans breathe comes from this source. ', ""https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/air-quality/oxygen\nOxygen atoms are \x1b[95m[1] very reactive, and are incorporated into many common chemical compounds, such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2)\x1b[0m, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur oxides (SO2 and SO3), and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2). About 21% of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen. This hasn't always been the case, though. Early in our planet's history, the atmosphere had almost no oxygen. Microbes that produce their food via photosynthesis generate oxygen as a by-product. \x1b[95m[3] Oxygen from photosynthetic microbes eventually built up in the atmosphere, drastically changing our planet's environment\x1b[0m and the history of life in the process. Oxygen plays a critical role in respiration, the energy-producing chemistry that drives the metabolisms of most living things. We humans, along with many other creatures, need oxygen in the air we breathe to stay alive. Oxygen is generated during photosynthesis by plants and many types of microbes. Plants both use oxygen (during respiration) and produce it (via photosynthesis). "", 'https://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/ocean-chemistry/oxygen/\nThe present-day distribution of oxygen in the internal deep ocean is thus determined by a complicated and not fully understood interplay of water circulation and bio\xadlogical productivity, which leads to oxygen consumption in the ocean’s interior. Extensive measurements have shown that the highest oxygen concentrations are found at high latitudes, where the ocean is cold, especially well-mixed and ventilated. The mid-latitudes, by contrast, especially on the western coasts of the continents, are characterized by marked oxygen-deficient zones. The oxygen supply here is very weak due to the sluggish water circulation, and this is further compounded by \xadelevated oxygen consumption due to high biological productivity. This leads to a situation where the oxygen is almost completely depleted in the depth range between 100 and 1000 metres. This situation is also observed in the northern Indian Ocean in the area of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. ', 'https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/ocean-deoxygenation\nGlobally, oceans have lost around 2% of dissolved oxygen since the 1950s and are expected to lose about 3–4% by the year 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), though the scale of effect is predicted to vary regionally. Much of the oxygen loss is concentrated in the upper 1000m where species richness and abundance is highest. Even slight overall reductions in the levels of oxygen dissolved in the oceans can induce oxygen stress in marine organisms by depriving them of an adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level (termed hypoxia). The loss of oxygen in the ocean has two major causes: Ocean warming-driven deoxygenation: Warmer ocean water holds less oxygen and is more buoyant than cooler water. This leads to reduced mixing of oxygenated water near the surface with deeper waters, which naturally contain less oxygen. Warmer water also raises oxygen demand from living organisms. As a result, less oxygen is available for marine life. ', 'https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/ocean-deoxygenation\nVirtually all the ocean’s food provisioning ecosystem services for humans require oxygen to support organism growth and production. Oxygen is necessary to sustain the life of all the fishes and invertebrates, and deoxygenation is already causing measurable declines of fish species. Some of the ocean’s most productive biomes, supporting one fifth of the world’s wild marine fish harvest, are formed by ocean currents that bring nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor water to coasts that line the eastern edges of the world’s ocean basins. As naturally oxygen-poor systems, these areas are particularly vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation, and such effects may ripple out and affect hundreds of millions of people. Degraded habitats caused by climate change-driven hypoxia and increased algal blooms may lead to reduced catches for fisheries and possible collapse of regional stocks. ', 'https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/8/oxygen\nOxygen first appeared in the Earth’s atmosphere around 2 billion years ago, accumulating from the photosynthesis of blue-green algae. Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen passes into the atmosphere and the hydrogen joins with carbon dioxide to produce biomass.When living things need energy they take in oxygen for respiration. The oxygen returns to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Oxygen gas is fairly soluble in water, which makes aerobic life in rivers, lakes and oceans possible. Natural abundance \x1b[0;30;47m[4] Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere by volume\x1b[0m. This is halfway between 17% (below which breathing for unacclimatised people becomes difficult) and 25% (above which many organic compounds are highly flammable). \x1b[0;30;47m[5] The element and its compounds make up 49.2% by mass of the Earth’s crust\x1b[0m, and about two-thirds of the human body. There are two key methods used to obtain oxygen gas. The first is by the distillation of liquid air. The second is to pass clean, dry air through a zeolite that absorbs nitrogen and leaves oxygen. A newer method, which gives oxygen of a higher purity, is to pass air over a partially permeable ceramic membrane.In the laboratory it can be prepared by the electrolysis of water or by adding a manganese(IV) oxide catalyst to aqueous hydrogen peroxide.

The college-based divestment efforts may or may not have played a role in immediately affecting the South African economy, but they did raise awareness about the problem of apartheid. After the divestment movement gained worldwide notoriety, U.S. Congress was moved to pass a series of economic sanctions against the South African government. From 1985 to 1990, over 200 U.S. companies cut all ties with South Africa, resulting in a loss of $1 billion in direct American investment. South Africa was ravaged by capital flight as businesses, investors, and money left the country. The rand, South Africa's currency, was significantly devalued and inflation reached double digits. The economic situation, as well as the resistance efforts of those suffering under apartheid, meant South Africa's system had to come to an end.

Spreading centers end in transform faults or in overlapping spreading center offsets. A spreading center includes a seismically active plate boundary zone a few kilometers to tens of kilometers wide, a crustal accretion zone within the boundary zone where the ocean crust is youngest, and an instantaneous plate boundary - a line within the crustal accretion zone demarcating the two separating plates. Within the crustal accretion zone is a 1–2 km-wide neovolcanic zone where active volcanism occurs. Incipient spreading Plates in the crust of the earth, according to the plate tectonics theory In the general case, seafloor spreading starts as a rift in a continental land mass, similar to the Red Sea-East Africa Rift System today. The process starts by heating at the base of the continental crust which causes it to become more plastic and less dense. Because less dense objects rise in relation to denser objects, the area being heated becomes a broad dome (see isostasy). As the crust bows upward, fractures occur that gradually grow into rifts. The typical rift system consists of three rift arms at approximately 120-degree angles. These areas are named triple junctions and can be found in several places across the world today. The separated margins of the continents evolve to form passive margins. Hess' theory was that new seafloor is formed when magma is forced upward toward the surface at a mid-ocean ridge. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading\nSeafloor spreading, or seafloor spread, is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. History of study Earlier theories by Alfred Wegener and Alexander du Toit of continental drift postulated that continents in motion 'plowed' through the fixed and immovable seafloor. The idea that the seafloor itself moves and also carries the continents with it as it spreads from a central rift axis was proposed by Harold Hammond Hess from Princeton University and Robert Dietz of the U.S. Naval Electronics Laboratory in San Diego in the 1960s. The phenomenon is known today as plate tectonics. In locations where two plates move apart, at mid-ocean ridges, new seafloor is continually formed during seafloor spreading. Significance Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate slab pull at subduction zones, rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. Plates that are not subducting are driven by gravity sliding off the elevated mid-ocean ridges a process called ridge push. \x1b[92m[2] At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed\x1b[0m. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Spreading rate is the rate at which an ocean basin widens due to seafloor spreading. (The rate at which new oceanic lithosphere is added to each tectonic plate on either side of a mid-ocean ridge is the spreading half-rate and is equal to half of the spreading rate). Spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 90 mm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 40–90 mm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 40 mm/year.:\u200a2 The highest known rate was over 200 mm/yr during the Miocene on the East Pacific Rise.

"", ""As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 145 ± 4 mm/yr between the Pacific and Nazca plates. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced. "", 'Sediment on the ocean floor would be thick from billions of years of runoff from the land; instead, the sediment, particularly in the middle of the seafloor, is very thin. This supports the idea that the ocean floor is spreading as plates move, making the ocean floor the newest part of earth’s crust. Earthquakes and volcanoes are concentrated on plate boundaries. This is explained by tectonic movement—as plates collide with each other, the subduction of one or both plates creates the magma and force necessary for earthquakes and volcanoes. The seafloor is magnetic. This can be explained by the lava that surfaces on the ocean floor and becomes magnetized before it cools. This lava surfaces because the seafloor is spreading, which supports the idea of plate tectonics. Areas of old and new crust exist on the ocean floor. Crust is new at the mid-ocean ridges, where plates are spreading apart, and old at ocean trenches, where plates are colliding. ', 'Spreading is hypothesized to start within a continental area with up-warping or doming of crust related to an underlying mantle plume or series of mantle plumes. The buoyancy of the mantle plume material creates a dome within the crust, causing it to fracture. When a series of mantle plumes exists beneath a large continent, the resulting rifts may align and lead to the formation of a rift valley (such as the present-day Great Rift Valley in eastern Africa). It is suggested that this type of valley eventually develops into a linear sea (such as the present-day Red Sea), and finally into an ocean (such as the Atlantic). It is likely that as many as 20 mantle plumes, many of which still exist, were responsible for the initiation of the rifting of Pangaea along what is now the mid-Atlantic ridge.

124,443,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_card\nA Christmas card is a greeting card sent as part of the traditional celebration of Christmas in order to convey between people a range of sentiments related to Christmastide and the holiday season. Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including some non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads 'wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year'. There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer, Christmas song lyrics or Biblical verse; others focus on the general holiday season with an all-inclusive 'Season's greetings'. The first modern Christmas card was by John Calcott Horsley. A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves. History The world's first commercially produced Christmas card, designed by John Callcott Horsley for Henry Cole in 1843 Children looking at Christmas cards in New York 1910 Christmas card by Louis Prang, showing a group of anthropomorphized frogs parading with banner and band. The first known Christmas card was sent by Michael Maier to James I of England and his son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1611. It was discovered in 1979 by Adam McLean in the Scottish Record Office. It was hand-made and incorporated Rosicrucian imagery, with the words of the greeting – 'A greeting on the birthday of the Sacred King, to the most worshipful and energetic lord and most eminent James, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Defender of the true faith, with a gesture of joyful celebration of the Birthday of the Lord, in most joyand fortune, we enter into the new auspicious year 1612' – being laid out to form a rose. \x1b[92m[1] The first commercially available card was commissioned by Sir Henry Cole and designed by John Callcott Horsley in London 1843\x1b[0m. The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor. Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each. Early British cards rarely showed winter or religious themes, instead favoring flowers, fairies and other fanciful designs that reminded the recipient of the approach of spring. Humorous and sentimental images of children and animals were popular, as were increasingly elaborate shapes, decorations and materials. At Christmas 1873, the lithograph firm Prang and Mayer began creating greeting cards for the popular market in Britain. The firm began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874, thus becoming the first printer to offer cards in America. Its owner, Louis Prang, is sometimes called the 'father of the American Christmas card.' By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the chromolithography process of printmaking. However, the popularity of his cards led to cheap imitations that eventually drove him from the market. The advent of the postcard spelled the end for elaborate Victorian-style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day, including Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card. The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand Hallmark Cards was established in 1913 by Joyce Hall with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards. The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of World War I increased demand for cards to send to soldiers. The World Wars brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic 'studio cards' with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of Victorian and Edwardian cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004. Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters – especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone. Some card manufacturers now provide E-cards. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period. In mostly non-religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are called New Year Cards; they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols. Official Christmas cards President Johnson's 1967 White House Christmas card 'Official' Christmas cards began with Queen Victoria in the 1840s. The British royal family's cards are generally portraits reflecting significant personal events of the year. There is a long-standing custom for the American President and First Lady to send White House Christmas Cards each holiday season. The practice originated with President Calvin Coolidge, who was the first president to issue a written statement of peaceful tidings during the holidays in 1927. President Herbert Hoover was the first to give Christmas notes to the White House staff, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to utilize the card format (rather than the previously used notes or a written statement) that most closely resembles the Christmas cards of today. In 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first official White House card. The cards usually depict White House scenes as rendered by prominent American artists. The number of recipients has snowballed over the decades, from just 2,000 in 1961 to 1.4 million in 2005. Commercial Christmas cards Tucker Corporation Christmas Card, 1947 Many organizations produce special Christmas cards as a fundraising tool. The most famous of these enterprises is probably the UNICEF Christmas card program, launched in 1949, which selects artwork from internationally known artists for card reproduction. The UK-based Charities Advisory Trust used to give out an annual 'Scrooge Award' to the cards that return the smallest percentage to the charities they claim to support although it is not universally well received by the Christmas card producers. The RSPB produced the first ever charity Christmas card in 1898, selling 4,500 that year  Christmas stamps and stickers Santa Coming Down the Chimney Many countries produce official Christmas stamps, which may be brightly coloured and depict some aspect of Christmas tradition or a Nativity scene. Small decorative stickers are also made to seal the back of envelopes, typically showing a trinket or some symbol of Christmas. From the beginning, Christmas cards have been avidly collected. Queen Mary amassed a large collection that is now housed in the British Museum. The University College London's Slade School of Fine Art houses a collection of handmade Christmas Cards from alumni such as Paula Rego and Richard Hamilton and are displayed at events over the Christmas season, when members of the public can make their own Christmas cards in the Strang Print Room. Specimens from the 'golden age' of printing (1840s–1890s) are especially prized and bring in large sums at auctions. In December 2005, one of Horsley's original cards sold for nearly £9,000. Collectors may focus on particular images like Santa Claus, poets, or printing techniques. The Christmas card that holds the world record as the most expensive ever sold was a card produced in 1843 by J. C. Horsley and commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole. The card, one of the world's first, was sold in 2001 by UK auctioneers Henry Aldridge to an anonymous bidder for a record breaking £22,250.

""]",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_card'],"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_card\nA Christmas card is a greeting card sent as part of the traditional celebration of Christmas in order to convey between people a range of sentiments related to Christmastide and the holiday season. Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including some non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads 'wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year'. There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer, Christmas song lyrics or Biblical verse; others focus on the general holiday season with an all-inclusive 'Season's greetings'. The first modern Christmas card was by John Calcott Horsley. A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves. History The world's first commercially produced Christmas card, designed by John Callcott Horsley for Henry Cole in 1843 Children looking at Christmas cards in New York 1910 Christmas card by Louis Prang, showing a group of anthropomorphized frogs parading with banner and band. The first known Christmas card was sent by Michael Maier to James I of England and his son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1611. It was discovered in 1979 by Adam McLean in the Scottish Record Office. It was hand-made and incorporated Rosicrucian imagery, with the words of the greeting – 'A greeting on the birthday of the Sacred King, to the most worshipful and energetic lord and most eminent James, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Defender of the true faith, with a gesture of joyful celebration of the Birthday of the Lord, in most joyand fortune, we enter into the new auspicious year 1612' – being laid out to form a rose. \x1b[92m[1] The first commercially available card was commissioned by Sir Henry Cole and designed by John Callcott Horsley in London 1843\x1b[0m. The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor. Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each. Early British cards rarely showed winter or religious themes, instead favoring flowers, fairies and other fanciful designs that reminded the recipient of the approach of spring. Humorous and sentimental images of children and animals were popular, as were increasingly elaborate shapes, decorations and materials. At Christmas 1873, the lithograph firm Prang and Mayer began creating greeting cards for the popular market in Britain. The firm began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874, thus becoming the first printer to offer cards in America. Its owner, Louis Prang, is sometimes called the 'father of the American Christmas card.' By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the chromolithography process of printmaking. However, the popularity of his cards led to cheap imitations that eventually drove him from the market. The advent of the postcard spelled the end for elaborate Victorian-style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day, including Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card. The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand Hallmark Cards was established in 1913 by Joyce Hall with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards. The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of World War I increased demand for cards to send to soldiers. The World Wars brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic 'studio cards' with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of Victorian and Edwardian cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004. Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters – especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone. Some card manufacturers now provide E-cards. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period. In mostly non-religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are called New Year Cards; they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols. Official Christmas cards President Johnson's 1967 White House Christmas card 'Official' Christmas cards began with Queen Victoria in the 1840s.

"", ""Fiddler on the Roof is based on Tevye (or Tevye the Dairyman) and his Daughters, a series of stories by Sholem Aleichem that he wrote in Yiddish between 1894 and 1914 about Jewish life in a village in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia at the turn of the 20th century. The stories are based on Aleichem's own upbringing near modern-day Kyiv (fictionalized as Yehupetz). It is also influenced by Life is with People, by Mark Zborowski and Elizabeth Herzog. Aleichem wrote a dramatic adaptation of the stories that he left unfinished at his death, but which was produced in Yiddish in 1919 by the Yiddish Art Theater and made into a film in the 1930s. In the late 1950s, a musical based on the stories, called Tevye and his Daughters, was produced off-Broadway by Arnold Perl. Rodgers and Hammerstein and then Mike Todd briefly considered bringing this musical to Broadway but dropped the idea. The Fiddler by Marc Chagall, c. 1912 Investors and some in the media worried that Fiddler on the Roof might be considered 'too Jewish' to attract mainstream audiences. Other critics considered that it was too culturally sanitized, 'middlebrow' and superficial; Philip Roth, writing in The New Yorker, called it shtetl kitsch. For example, it portrays the local Russian officer as sympathetic, instead of brutal and cruel, as Sholom Aleichem had described him. Aleichem's stories ended with Tevye alone, his wife dead and his daughters scattered; at the end of Fiddler, the family members are alive, and most are emigrating together to America. The show found the right balance for its time, even if not entirely authentic, to become 'one of the first popular post-Holocaust depictions of the vanished world of Eastern European Jewry'. Harold Prince replaced the original producer Fred Coe and brought in director/choreographer Jerome Robbins. The writers and Robbins considered naming the musical Tevye, before landing on a title suggested by various paintings by Marc Chagall (Green Violinist (1924), Le Mort (1924), The Fiddler (1912)) that also inspired the original set design.

Back when computers were the size of entire rooms, everybody had to share. It's strange to think about because our mobile devices let us carry more computing power around in our pockets. But in the 1960s, computer nerds engineers had to sign up for time to work and shared the machine with others. Noel Morris and Tom Van Vleck were working at MIT in 1965 when they noticed a memo mentioning the idea of creating a mail command. The two looked into it and found no one had taken on the job yet. What they developed was a way to leave messages between people sharing computers. For example, you could let a colleague know their files had been backed up. Noel Morris was the brother of filmmaker Errol Morris who has blogged for the New York Times about Noel and Tom's contribution to the history of email. 1971: Ray Tomlinson invents email at ARPANET Most people give Ray Tomlinson the title of email’s inventor. He came up with the idea while working for ARPANET, the government-funded research project that eventually became the internet. At the time, you could only leave messages for people using the same computer. Tomlinson created a program that gave users the ability to send messages between connected computers on the ARPANET system. The first email was sent between these two ARPANET computers Ray Tomlinson Among Tomlinson’s most notable contributions to email as we know it today is the use of the @ symbol. Tomlinson passed away in 2016, but he lived to see his idea adopted by people all over the world. In 2012, Tomlinson told his story of the invention of email to The Verge and said people ended up using it just as he envisioned: 'ARPANET was very young and looking for problems it could solve. I had an experimental file-transfer protocol, but the real one was still in the works. I didn’t want to wait for that, so I wrote a simple little one for my own use, and glued that onto the SNDMSG program so I could send the mailbox file to another computer, where the receiver’s mailbox was.

Gary Thuerk earned the title 'father of spam' after sending an unsolicited marketing message to hundreds of ARPANET users in 1978. He was promoting a new product for Digital Equipment Corporation. Thuerk claims the email earned $13 million in sales. That sounds like pretty good engagement and a strong conversion rate. And email still gets incredible ROI. So, you have to wonder...

Originally played at the very first Olympic Games in Greece in 1896, the original hymn was written in Greek by the Greek poet Kostis Palamas. Following this Olympics, each host country came up with its own hymn until 1958 when the International Olympic Committee made the original Greek hymn the official Olympic Hymn.

Both poet and composer were the choice of the Greek Demetrius Vikelas, who was the first President of the International Olympic Committee. History The anthem was performed for the first time for the ceremony of opening of the first edition at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. In the following years, every hosting nation commissioned to various musicians the composition of a specific Olympic hymn for their own edition of the games. List of performances at the Olympics The anthem has been recorded and performed in many different languages, usually as a result of the hosting of either form of the Games in various countries. The IOC doesn't require that the anthem be performed in either English or Greek, but in the 2008 & 2022 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies, in Beijing, China, Greek was sung instead of the host country's official language, Mandarin. Also in the 2016 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, English was sung instead of host country's official language, Brazilian Portuguese and in the 2020 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies in Tokyo, Japan, English was also sung instead of Japanese.

R117H in association with 7T may result in normal, borderline or elevated sweat values and a variable clinical presentation (Kiesewetter et al, 1993; Rave-Harel et al, 1997; Massie et al, 2001; Peckham et al, 2006). Genotyping ', 'The CFTR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position q31.2 [9]. To date, over 1,900 sequence variations in the CFTR gene have been reported [10], although a detailed understanding of how CFTR mutations impact channel dysfunction is limited to a only a few of these [11]. This implies a relatively small list of well-defined CFTR mutations known to be CF disease causing, whereas the functional consequence of various rare sequence variations remains unknown or has been shown not to be CF disease causing [12]. The majority of identified CFTR gene mutations fall into one of six classes that account for ∼80% of all CF patients [9]. Of the >1,900 CFTR mutations that have been identified so far, approximately only 20 mutations have a frequency >0.1% [9]. In fact, notwithstanding the common F508del variant, only four CFTR mutations have a frequency >0.1%: G551D, W1282X, G542X and N1303K, having a worldwide prevalence of around 1–3% each [9, 11]. F508del is the most common mutation with an allelic frequency of around 90% worldwide [13]. Mutation classification Class I and II CFTR mutations are typically characterised by a reduction in the quantity of expressed CFTR protein (fig. 1). Class I mutations can result from nonsense and frame-shift mutations, as well as mRNA splicing defects [14]. For example, G542X is a nonsense or stop mutation, where introduction of a premature termination codon (or stop codon) results in premature cessation of translation and production of truncated CFTR protein. Class II mutations, including F508del, have folding or maturation defects, which can result in premature CFTR degradation (fig. 1) [9]. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1.

The first mutation, c.1679+1634A>G, creates a very strong splice acceptor in intron 12 of CFTR with 99% of transcripts containing a 49bp pseudoexon with an in-frame TAA stop codon in the pseudoexon causing premature termination of the CFTR protein [21], and is classified as a severe CF-causing mutation. The second, c.3140-26A>G, creates a splice acceptor site 26 bp before exon 20 and therefore extends this exon by 25bp [22]. The resultant frameshift leads to premature termination of CFTR at a TGA stop codon. Whilst c.3140-26A>G disrupts 95% of CFTR transcripts, the production of ~5% normal transcripts is thought to explain the milder CF phenotype observed in individuals with this mutation. The final mutation, c.3718-2477C>T, creates a splice donor deep within intron 22 and leads to inclusion of an 84 bp pseudoexon (which contains an in-frame TAA stop codon) into the mRNA [23]. For individuals with c.3718-2477C>T, the 10th most common CF allele [5], a wide range of aberrant splicing has been reported, with a strong correlation between the level of mis-splicing and severity of disease [24–26]. ', 'The common delta F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interferes with the biosynthetic folding of nascent CFTR polypeptides, leading to their retention and rapid degradation in an intracellular compartment proximal to the Golgi apparatus. Neither the pathway by which wild-type CFTR folds nor the mechanism by which the Phe508 deletion interferes with this process is well understood. We have investigated the effect of glycerol, a polyhydric alcohol known to stabilize protein conformation, on the folding of CFTR and delta F508 in vivo. Incubation of transient and stable delta F508 transfectants with 10% glycerol induced a significant accumulation of delta F508 protein bearing complex N-linked oligosaccharides, indicative of their transit to a compartment distal to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This accumulation was accompanied by an increase in mean whole cell cAMP activated chloride conductance, suggesting that the glycerol-rescued delta F508 polypeptides form functional plasma membrane CFTR channels. These effects were dose- and time-dependent and fully reversible. Glycerol treatment also stabilized immature (core-glycosylated) delta F508 and CFTR molecules that are normally degraded rapidly. These effects of glycerol were not due to a general disruption of ER quality control processes but appeared to correlate with the degree of temperature sensitivity of specific CFTR mutations. These data suggest a model in which glycerol serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and subsequent release from the ER quality control apparatus. ', 'Not only is there heterogeneity in the mutations causing Cystic Fibrosis, but the pathogenetic mechanisms also vary. Deletion of phenylalanine-508 appears to cause disease by abrogating normal biosynthetic processing and thereby resulting in retention and degradation of the mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations, such as the relatively common G551D mutation [4], appear to be normally processed and, therefore, must cause disease through some other mechanism. G551D mutation, which is within the first nucleotide-binding fold of the CFTR, is the third most common CF mutation, with a worldwide frequency of 3.1% among CF chromosomes [5]. Several mutations result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced [6]. ', ""The most common CF mutation, F508del, is primarily considered to be a processing mutation. The F508del mutation removes a single amino acid from the CFTR protein. Without this building block, the CFTR protein cannot stay in the correct 3-D shape. The cell recognizes that the protein isn't the right shape and disposes of it. The drug combination Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) works by enabling CFTR protein with an F508del mutation to fold in a more correct shape, and then activates the protein to allow more chloride to pass through. Although this drug combination is not a perfect fix, it helps the mutant CFTR protein to move some chloride. This movement of chloride reduces the symptoms of CF. Watch the webcast (starting at 3:02) to learn more about CF protein processing mutations and how drugs such as CFTR modulators can help a person with one of these mutations.

In fact, notwithstanding the common F508del variant, only four CFTR mutations have a frequency >0.1%: G551D, W1282X, G542X and N1303K, having a worldwide prevalence of around 1–3% each [9, 11]. F508del is the most common mutation with an allelic frequency of around 90% worldwide [13]. Mutation classification Class I and II CFTR mutations are typically characterised by a reduction in the quantity of expressed CFTR protein (fig. 1). Class I mutations can result from nonsense and frame-shift mutations, as well as mRNA splicing defects [14]. For example, G542X is a nonsense or stop mutation, where introduction of a premature termination codon (or stop codon) results in premature cessation of translation and production of truncated CFTR protein. Class II mutations, including F508del, have folding or maturation defects, which can result in premature CFTR degradation (fig. 1) [9]. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1. ', 'https://health.mo.gov/lab/cf.php\n\x1b[102m[1] The most common mutation causing CF is a three-base pair deletion in the position of delta F508 (dF508)\x1b[0m, but there are now over 1800 mutations identified in the CFTR gene. The identification of increased immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in the blood of infants with CF has made neonatal screening for CF possible. Trypsinogen is one of the secretory products of the pancreas making its level in the blood a specific marker of pancreatic function. Detection of high levels of IRT in the newborn period place the infant at risk for CF.  Although there is no cure, newborns screened for cystic fibrosis can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment, which can: Improve growth Improve lung function Reduce hospital stays Add years to life ', 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184009\nThe three mutations we studied affect approximately 1.5% of individuals with CF and do not disrupt the classical canonical splicing regions [20], rather they cause CF by creating strong alternative splice sites which result in formation of pseudoexons or extend existing exons in CFTR. The first mutation, c.1679+1634A>G, creates a very strong splice acceptor in intron 12 of CFTR with 99% of transcripts containing a 49bp pseudoexon with an in-frame TAA stop codon in the pseudoexon causing premature termination of the CFTR protein [21], and is classified as a severe CF-causing mutation. The second, c.3140-26A>G, creates a splice acceptor site 26 bp before exon 20 and therefore extends this exon by 25bp [22]. The resultant frameshift leads to premature termination of CFTR at a TGA stop codon. Whilst c.3140-26A>G disrupts 95% of CFTR transcripts, the production of ~5% normal transcripts is thought to explain the milder CF phenotype observed in individuals with this mutation. The final mutation, c.3718-2477C>T, creates a splice donor deep within intron 22 and leads to inclusion of an 84 bp pseudoexon (which contains an in-frame TAA stop codon) into the mRNA [23]. For individuals with c.3718-2477C>T, the 10th most common CF allele [5], a wide range of aberrant splicing has been reported, with a strong correlation between the level of mis-splicing and severity of disease [24–26]. ', 'https://profiles.stanford.edu/jeffrey-wine\nThe common delta F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interferes with the biosynthetic folding of nascent CFTR polypeptides, leading to their retention and rapid degradation in an intracellular compartment proximal to the Golgi apparatus. Neither the pathway by which wild-type CFTR folds nor the mechanism by which the Phe508 deletion interferes with this process is well understood. We have investigated the effect of glycerol, a polyhydric alcohol known to stabilize protein conformation, on the folding of CFTR and delta F508 in vivo. Incubation of transient and stable delta F508 transfectants with 10% glycerol induced a significant accumulation of delta F508 protein bearing complex N-linked oligosaccharides, indicative of their transit to a compartment distal to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This accumulation was accompanied by an increase in mean whole cell cAMP activated chloride conductance, suggesting that the glycerol-rescued delta F508 polypeptides form functional plasma membrane CFTR channels. These effects were dose- and time-dependent and fully reversible. Glycerol treatment also stabilized immature (core-glycosylated) delta F508 and CFTR molecules that are normally degraded rapidly. These effects of glycerol were not due to a general disruption of ER quality control processes but appeared to correlate with the degree of temperature sensitivity of specific CFTR mutations. These data suggest a model in which glycerol serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and subsequent release from the ER quality control apparatus. ', 'https://www.asperbio.com/asper-reprogenetics/cystic-fibrosis-cf-genetic-testing/cystic-fibrosis\nNot only is there heterogeneity in the mutations causing Cystic Fibrosis, but the pathogenetic mechanisms also vary. Deletion of phenylalanine-508 appears to cause disease by abrogating normal biosynthetic processing and thereby resulting in retention and degradation of the mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations, such as the relatively common G551D mutation [4], appear to be normally processed and, therefore, must cause disease through some other mechanism. G551D mutation, which is within the first nucleotide-binding fold of the CFTR, is the third most common CF mutation, with a worldwide frequency of 3.1% among CF chromosomes [5]. Several mutations result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced [6]. ', ""https://www.cff.org/research-clinical-trials/types-cftr-mutations\nThe most common CF mutation, F508del, is primarily considered to be a processing mutation. The F508del mutation removes a single amino acid from the CFTR protein. Without this building block, the CFTR protein cannot stay in the correct 3-D shape. The cell recognizes that the protein isn't the right shape and disposes of it. The drug combination Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) works by enabling CFTR protein with an F508del mutation to fold in a more correct shape, and then activates the protein to allow more chloride to pass through. Although this drug combination is not a perfect fix, it helps the mutant CFTR protein to move some chloride. This movement of chloride reduces the symptoms of CF. Watch the webcast (starting at 3:02) to learn more about CF protein processing mutations and how drugs such as CFTR modulators can help a person with one of these mutations.

"", ""Someone wrote that country house life in peacetime was the apogee of human civilization. Could have been Orwell. Or probably couldn't have. The point as I recall is that the Upstairs and Downstairs people were equally happy in their own ways. There was a stable hierarchy and everyone knew their place. 'Knowing your place' is a term often used in connection with someone who tries to rise above it, but there's also such a thing as possessing and valuing your place. There is pride in doing one's job well, in being the epitome of a footman, a ladies' maid, a butler, a valet, or an Earl. In Downton Abbey, I think it possible that the happiest people may be Carson the butler and Patmore the cook--and upstairs, the Earl and his wife Countess Cora. They are happy because they do their jobs well and are loyal and helpful to those who depend on them.\tThe most admirable man, up or down, is Bates, the Earl's valet, but he is far from being the happiest. He has too active a conscience. In early life he went to prison to protect his worthless wife. Now he would rather be fired than cost another man his job--even if that man is the vile Thomas Barrow, who has lied about him and tried to frame him. Bates adds considerably to the entertainment value of 'Downton Abbey' by enlisting our deep sympathy, but there comes a time when defending your own honor ranks above protecting the job of a villain. Remember, too, that Bates has had to undergo alcoholism and being a 'cripple,' as everyone cheerfully describes him. Indeed, he almost got fired the first time because the loathsome Mrs. O'Brien tripped him at an embarrassing moment.

"", ""https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/think-of-me-as-the-butler-carson\nSomeone wrote that country house life in peacetime was the apogee of human civilization. Could have been Orwell. Or probably couldn't have. The point as I recall is that the Upstairs and Downstairs people were equally happy in their own ways. There was a stable hierarchy and everyone knew their place. 'Knowing your place' is a term often used in connection with someone who tries to rise above it, but there's also such a thing as possessing and valuing your place. There is pride in doing one's job well, in being the epitome of a footman, a ladies' maid, a butler, a valet, or an Earl. In Downton Abbey, I think it possible that the happiest people may be Carson the butler and Patmore the cook--and upstairs, the Earl and his wife Countess Cora. They are happy because they do their jobs well and are loyal and helpful to those who depend on them.\tThe most admirable man, up or down, is Bates, the Earl's valet, but he is far from being the happiest. He has too active a conscience. In early life he went to prison to protect his worthless wife. Now he would rather be fired than cost another man his job--even if that man is the vile Thomas Barrow, who has lied about him and tried to frame him. Bates adds considerably to the entertainment value of 'Downton Abbey' by enlisting our deep sympathy, but there comes a time when defending your own honor ranks above protecting the job of a villain. Remember, too, that Bates has had to undergo alcoholism and being a 'cripple,' as everyone cheerfully describes him. Indeed, he almost got fired the first time because the loathsome Mrs. O'Brien tripped him at an embarrassing moment.

Overview Timeline For most of the Western world, Romanticism was at its peak from approximately 1800 to 1850. The first Romantic ideas arose from an earlier German Counter-Enlightenment movement called Sturm und Drang (German: 'Storm and Stress'). This movement directly criticized the Enlightenment's position that humans can fully comprehend the world through rationality alone, suggesting that intuition and emotion are key components of insight and understanding. Published in 1774, 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe began to shape the Romanticist movement and its ideals. The events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also direct influences on the movement; many early Romantics throughout Europe sympathized with the ideals and achievements of French revolutionaries. "", ""Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as the glorification of the past and nature, preferring the medieval over the classical. Romanticism was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, and the prevailing ideology of the Age of Enlightenment, especially the scientific rationalization of Nature. The movement's ideals were embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature; it also had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences. Romanticism had a significant and complex effect on politics: Romantic thinking influenced conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and nationalism. "", ""The period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. Margaret Drabble described it in literature as taking place 'roughly between 1770 and 1848', and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, M. H. Abrams placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics. Others have proposed 1780–1830. In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; musical Romanticism, for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the Four Last Songs of Richard Strauss are described stylistically as 'Late Romantic' and were composed in 1946–48. However, in most fields the Romantic period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier. The early period of the Romantic era was a time of war, with the French Revolution (1789–1799) followed by the Napoleonic Wars until 1815. These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism. The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795 and 1805 had, in the words of one of their number, Alfred de Vigny, been 'conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums'.

The first major figure was François-René de Chateaubriand, an aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential novella of exile René (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (Génie du christianisme, 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous autobiography Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe ('Memoirs from beyond the grave'). "", ""The arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of Neoclassicism on the academies, but from the Napoleonic period it became increasingly popular, initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime, of which Girodet's Ossian receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes, for Napoleon's Château de Malmaison, was one of the earliest. Girodet's old teacher David was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil's direction, saying: 'Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting'. A new generation of the French school, developed personal Romantic styles, though still concentrating on history painting with a political message.

More recently, 'brown cow' can refer to a root beer float (i.e. vanilla ice cream floating in root beer soda).

Each day feels like it’s zooming along and I look back and wonder where all the time went. So much has changed that I can barely keep up with everything. Perhaps that’s why I like to take little trips back to my past. I remember that slowness and can reconnect with it just a bit. As my mind traveled back this evening, I remembered my mother saying, 'how now, brown cow?' as a form of greeting. I had no idea at the time where she’d picked up such a phrase, but it was apparently one used in teaching diction. It’s similar to the 'rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain' from My Fair Lady, though far shorter and more ridiculous. And it later became a fun way to greet people. The cow phrase, thankfully not the rain in Spain bit. I thought it was fun, even though she was technically referring to me as a cow. But, since I thought cows were rather cute, that felt like a compliment. Greetings like these date back to the time of William Shakespeare, which would have been something more like 'how say you now?' These more descriptive phrases, of course, have in modern times been artlessly reduced to 's’up?' It never occurred to me at the time, but that greeting my mother had used was rather revolutionary. By using it, she wasn’t simply asking what I had been doing, she was asking what I would immediately be doing next. So, my response was always a description of what I was thinking about doing and sometimes even a silly thing that just came to mind. I’ve no idea if she was doing it on purpose, but she taught me to always imagine more than just the moment I had just lived. Though that moment might have seemed perfectly mundane, what fun thing did I have planned to immediately take place next? I grew up always knowing that there was something more interesting waiting for me around the corner, and that’s fueled me through my entire life. Sure, some days are not particularly interesting, but there’s always a next one. And unlike the calf who zooms into adulthood, we have a bit more time to riddle it all out. Our own mothers and fathers have whispered amazing things into our ears and given us gifts of knowledge that we didn’t even realize we’d received at the time. A simple phrase, a casual instruction, and a gentle push in a particular direction. And, I adore the gift my mother gave me in that silly phrase, subtlety asking me to focus on the near future with just a simple, 'how now, brown cow?'

Each day feels like it’s zooming along and I look back and wonder where all the time went. So much has changed that I can barely keep up with everything. Perhaps that’s why I like to take little trips back to my past. I remember that slowness and can reconnect with it just a bit. As my mind traveled back this evening, I remembered my mother saying, 'how now, brown cow?' as a form of greeting. I had no idea at the time where she’d picked up such a phrase, but it was apparently one used in teaching diction. It’s similar to the 'rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain' from My Fair Lady, though far shorter and more ridiculous. And it later became a fun way to greet people. The cow phrase, thankfully not the rain in Spain bit. I thought it was fun, even though she was technically referring to me as a cow. But, since I thought cows were rather cute, that felt like a compliment. Greetings like these date back to the time of William Shakespeare, which would have been something more like 'how say you now?' These more descriptive phrases, of course, have in modern times been artlessly reduced to 's’up?' It never occurred to me at the time, but that greeting my mother had used was rather revolutionary. By using it, she wasn’t simply asking what I had been doing, she was asking what I would immediately be doing next. So, my response was always a description of what I was thinking about doing and sometimes even a silly thing that just came to mind. I’ve no idea if she was doing it on purpose, but she taught me to always imagine more than just the moment I had just lived. Though that moment might have seemed perfectly mundane, what fun thing did I have planned to immediately take place next? I grew up always knowing that there was something more interesting waiting for me around the corner, and that’s fueled me through my entire life. Sure, some days are not particularly interesting, but there’s always a next one. And unlike the calf who zooms into adulthood, we have a bit more time to riddle it all out. Our own mothers and fathers have whispered amazing things into our ears and given us gifts of knowledge that we didn’t even realize we’d received at the time. A simple phrase, a casual instruction, and a gentle push in a particular direction. And, I adore the gift my mother gave me in that silly phrase, subtlety asking me to focus on the near future with just a simple, 'how now, brown cow?'

I am bringing up this subject because I don’t hear well.  At least I don’t hear well enough to distinguish words as many, even most, people deliver them.  I wish more speakers would take advantage of Toastmaster’s International or other public speaking opportunities.  Communication is a two way street.   We hear a lot about being a good listener, but not much about being a good speaker. One way to practice speaking plainly is by use of tongue twisters.  So have your children and grand children join in old fashioned stand byes like: How now, Brown Cow. Rubber baby buggy bumpers. Susie’s sister sewed socks for soldiers. A flea and a fly flew up the flue. Of all the smells I have ever smelt, I have never smelt a smell that smelt like that smell smelt. The sixth sick Sheik’s sixth sheep’s sick.

"", ""Game of Thrones concluded what's arguably its best season with one of its finest — and the bloodiest — episodes, 'The Winds of Winter', which excelled in dramatic storytelling just as last week's 'Battle of the Bastards' raised the bar for action sequences. Though the finale shifted from the battlefield, the events were, if anything, far more seismic, with game-changing revelations and huge moves from every corner of the realm that established some very clear new conflicts going into season 7. Just look at all that happened in those 69 minutes: Dany set sail for Westeros, Dorne joined forces with both Dany and the Tyrells, Arya returned to Westeros and crossed a major name off her list, Jon became King in the North, and Cersei blew up her enemies and then claimed the Iron Throne for herself. There was death and destruction galore, but it was also rather gleeful death and destruction, as favorite characters mostly got exactly what they wanted. — James Hibberd, Entertainment Weekly "", ""Ellaria : 'The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.'Olenna: 'Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter.

Ellaria: 'Vengeance. Justice.' Varys: 'Fire and blood.' Behind the scenes[] General[] The episode title is a reference to the name of the unpublished sixth novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter. The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of Daenerys's theme. On the official soundtrack release it is titled 'The Winds of Winter.' With a run time of 68 minutes, this episode was the longest of the television series until it was dethroned by 'Beyond the Wall,' three minutes longer at 71 minutes. "", ""Season 6 continues the show tradition of killing off at least one king per season: Season 1 -Robert Baratheon; Season 2 - Renly Baratheon; Season 3 - Robb Stark; Season 4 - Joffrey; Season 5 - Mance Rayder and Stannis Baratheon; Season 6 - Balon Greyjoy and Tommen. The number of recurring characters who were killed in this episode (eleven) is greater than in any of the former episodes. Of those, only two characters have died by the point the books reached - Kevan and Pycelle, both killed by Varys in the epilogue of the fifth book; Loras was horrifically harmed during the siege of Dragonstone in the novels, but he is still alive. The episode confirms two fan theories about the novels: the theory that Jon is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, and about the pies which Lord Manderly brought to Ramsay's wedding feast. Both were heavily implied but they haven't been outright confirmed yet. "", ""Early casting calls for Season 6 seem to indicate that Lord Manderly would actually have given the speech in the original version - perhaps revealing that he had been a staunch Stark supporter all along (because 'the North remembers') as he was in the novels. The final aired version simply has all of the vassals apologize for not following the Starks earlier - when in the books it was a major thematic point that they kept fighting for the Starks, because the Starks' honor had earned them undying loyalty from their vassals, while the Boltons' atrocities had alienated all of them. The exact report from WatchersOnTheWall.com stated: 'He is a fat nobleman in his 60’s. He has distinctive rugged features, a Northern accent, and a distinguished air.

The master of the little birds apologizes to one of his victims, stating that he doesn't bear him any ill will and that he doesn't deserve to die alone. Ser Kevan Lannister is killed. Varys is back in Westeros to pave the way for the restoration of House Targaryen. White ravens sent by the Citadel arrive on a major castle, confirming that winter has arrived.

This is actually pretty cool and suitably epic, though I do wonder how the Dothraki suddenly all look like expert sailors. Also, I didn’t notice it the first time I watched because I was wondering how Varys teleported back so quickly, but some of the ships have the Dornish sun on their sails, so it’s not just Varys who got back inexplicably quickly; it’s a whole fleet of ships that teleported in. The dragons still look cool, and I guess we’re in for a bunch of epic battles going forward with a pared down cast and basically nothing left for the show to do but have all-out war. The real question, though, is how are they going to squeeze in more brothel scenes now? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Miscellaneous Thoughts That fabric on Margaery’s dress is incredible.

Behind the scenes[] General[] The episode title is a reference to the name of the unpublished sixth novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter. The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of Daenerys's theme. On the official soundtrack release it is titled 'The Winds of Winter.' With a run time of 68 minutes, this episode was the longest of the television series until it was dethroned by 'Beyond the Wall,' three minutes longer at 71 minutes. "", ""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter\nSeason 6 continues the show tradition of killing off at least one king per season: Season 1 -Robert Baratheon; Season 2 - Renly Baratheon; Season 3 - Robb Stark; Season 4 - Joffrey; Season 5 - Mance Rayder and Stannis Baratheon; Season 6 - Balon Greyjoy and Tommen. The number of recurring characters who were killed in this episode (eleven) is greater than in any of the former episodes. Of those, only two characters have died by the point the books reached - Kevan and Pycelle, both killed by Varys in the epilogue of the fifth book; Loras was horrifically harmed during the siege of Dragonstone in the novels, but he is still alive. The episode confirms two fan theories about the novels: the theory that Jon is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, and about the pies which Lord Manderly brought to Ramsay's wedding feast. Both were heavily implied but they haven't been outright confirmed yet. "", ""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter\nEarly casting calls for Season 6 seem to indicate that Lord Manderly would actually have given the speech in the original version - perhaps revealing that he had been a staunch Stark supporter all along (because 'the North remembers') as he was in the novels. The final aired version simply has all of the vassals apologize for not following the Starks earlier - when in the books it was a major thematic point that they kept fighting for the Starks, because the Starks' honor had earned them undying loyalty from their vassals, while the Boltons' atrocities had alienated all of them. The exact report from WatchersOnTheWall.com stated: 'He is a fat nobleman in his 60’s. He has distinctive rugged features, a Northern accent, and a distinguished air. Our source says he has a stirring speech during which he unexpectedly shifts political allegiance.[14] "", ""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter\nIn the books[] Main page: Differences in adaptation/Game of Thrones: Season 6#'The Winds of Winter' The episode is adapted from the following chapters of A Game of Thrones: Chapter 5, Jon I: During King Robert's visit, Jon sits away from his family during the feast and is seated with squires of similar age to him.

Epilogue: Grand Maester Pycelle is killed. Varys's little birds stab a member of the Small Council to death. The master of the little birds apologizes to one of his victims, stating that he doesn't bear him any ill will and that he doesn't deserve to die alone. Ser Kevan Lannister is killed. Varys is back in Westeros to pave the way for the restoration of House Targaryen. White ravens sent by the Citadel arrive on a major castle, confirming that winter has arrived. The rest of the episode appears to draw material from what will come in the sixth novel, The Winds of Winter.

This is actually pretty cool and suitably epic, though I do wonder how the Dothraki suddenly all look like expert sailors. Also, I didn’t notice it the first time I watched because I was wondering how Varys teleported back so quickly, but some of the ships have the Dornish sun on their sails, so it’s not just Varys who got back inexplicably quickly; it’s a whole fleet of ships that teleported in. The dragons still look cool, and I guess we’re in for a bunch of epic battles going forward with a pared down cast and basically nothing left for the show to do but have all-out war. The real question, though, is how are they going to squeeze in more brothel scenes now? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Miscellaneous Thoughts That fabric on Margaery’s dress is incredible.

Right from the first scene, and right up until the last, just about every bit was simply gorgeous. An almost mournful piano greets us in the High Sept. Later, during Cersei's coronation, the urgent rise and fall of strings, dark and moody. The episode deserves awards based on its music alone. Update: Here's that opening piano number.

According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Yanomami, a tribe of approximately 29,000, struggles to preserve their land, culture, and traditional way of life due to encroaching illegal gold miners, malnutrition, and malaria. Meanwhile, in 2022, the region's severe drought, has led to a devastating increase in water temperatures, reaching 39.1 degrees Celsius, causing the tragic demise of 125 Amazon river dolphins. This unfortunate event serves as a poignant marker of the deteriorating environmental conditions, indicating the increasing vulnerability of the river's ecosystem. In recent years, the Amazon River has experienced historically low water levels, the lowest in over a century.

Every year, the river rises more than 9 m (30 ft), flooding the surrounding forests, known as várzea ('flooded forests'). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world. In an average dry season, 110,000 km2 (42,000 sq mi) of land are water-covered, while in the wet season, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to 350,000 km2 (140,000 sq mi).

The plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million km2 and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation. Lack of bridges "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate. Watershed Main article: Amazon basin The Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately 7,050,000 km2 (2,720,000 sq mi). It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It \x1b[102m[3] gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude\x1b[0m. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean. The Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than 9 m (30 ft), flooding the surrounding forests, known as várzea ('flooded forests'). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world. In an average dry season, 110,000 km2 (42,000 sq mi) of land are water-covered, while in the wet season, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to 350,000 km2 (140,000 sq mi). "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River\nThe main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to Manaus, 1,500 km (930 mi) upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels below 9000 tons and with less than 5.5 m (18 ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos, Peru, 3,600 km (2,200 mi) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (480 mi) higher, as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the Pongo de Manseriche, just above Achual Point in Peru. Annual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the Atlantic are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting undular tidal bore is called the pororoca, with a leading wave that can be up to 7.6 m (25 ft) high and travel up to 800 km (500 mi) inland. Geology The Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River\n\x1b[0;30;47m[1] The Amazon River serves as a vital lifeline for more than 47 million people in its basin\x1b[0m and faces a multitude of challenges that threaten both its ecosystem and the indigenous communities dependent on its resources. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Yanomami, a tribe of approximately 29,000, struggles to preserve their land, culture, and traditional way of life due to encroaching illegal gold miners, malnutrition, and malaria. Meanwhile, in 2022, the region's severe drought, has led to a devastating increase in water temperatures, reaching 39.1 degrees Celsius, causing the tragic demise of 125 Amazon river dolphins. This unfortunate event serves as a poignant marker of the deteriorating environmental conditions, indicating the increasing vulnerability of the river's ecosystem. In recent years, the Amazon River has experienced historically low water levels, the lowest in over a century. Brazil, the primary custodian of this invaluable natural resource, grapples with the challenges of mitigating the effects of this drought on communities and ecosystems, further emphasizing the urgency of sustainable environmental management and conservation efforts.

I will return to them later, because the interplay between the retina and the surrounding structures is critical to important pathologies of the retina. \x1b[1;31;60m[1] Retinal ganglion cells are the cells whose axons form the optic nerve\x1b[0m. They line the anterior surface of the retina. Their axons run across the retinal surface and then \x1b[1;31;60m[4] join together to form the optic nerve\x1b[0m. I will come back later to the reasons why the retina is arranged as it is. ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve\nThe optic nerve has been classified as the second of twelve paired cranial nerves, but it is technically a myelinated tract of the central nervous system, rather than a classical nerve of the peripheral nervous system because it is derived from an out-pouching of the diencephalon (optic stalks) during embryonic development. As a consequence, the fibers of the optic nerve are covered with myelin produced by oligodendrocytes, rather than Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, and are encased within the meninges. Peripheral neuropathies like Guillain–Barré syndrome do not affect the optic nerve. However, most typically, the optic nerve is grouped with the other eleven cranial nerves and is considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system. The optic nerve is ensheathed in all three meningeal layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia mater) rather than the epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium found in peripheral nerves. Fiber tracts of the mammalian central nervous system have only limited regenerative capabilities compared to the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, in most mammals, optic nerve damage results in irreversible blindness. \x1b[92m[5] The fibers from the retina run along the optic nerve to nine primary visual nuclei in the brain\x1b[0m, from which a major relay inputs into the primary visual cortex. A fundus photograph showing the back of the retina. The white circle is the beginning of the optic nerve. \x1b[92m[2] The optic nerve is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glia\x1b[0m. Each human optic nerve contains between 770,000 and 1.7 million nerve fibers, which are axons of the retinal ganglion cells of one retina. In the fovea, which has high acuity, these ganglion cells connect to as few as 5 photoreceptor cells; in other areas of the retina, they connect to thousands of photoreceptors. The optic nerve leaves the orbit (eye socket) via the optic canal, running postero-medially towards the optic chiasm, where there is a partial decussation (crossing) of fibers from the temporal visual fields (the nasal hemi-retina) of both eyes. The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species, and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species. Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex, while other axons terminate in the pretectal area and are involved in reflexive eye movements. Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. Its diameter increases from about 1.6 mm within the eye to 3.5 mm in the orbit to 4.5 mm within the cranial space. The optic nerve component lengths are 1 mm in the globe, 24 mm in the orbit, 9 mm in the optic canal, and 16 mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm. There, partial decussation occurs, and about 53% of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts. Most of these fibers terminate in the lateral geniculate body. Based on this anatomy, the optic nerve may be divided into four parts as indicated in the image at the top of this section (this view is from above as if you were looking into the orbit after the top of the skull had been removed): 1. the optic head (which is where it begins in the eyeball (globe) with fibers from the retina); 2. orbital part (which is the part within the orbit); 3. intracanicular part (which is the part within a bony canal known as the optic canal); and, 4. cranial part (the part within the cranial cavity, which ends at the optic chiasm). ', 'https://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-i-foundations/simple-anatomy-of-the-retina/\n\x1b[95m[3] The ganglion cell axons run in the nerve fiber layer above the inner limiting membrane towards the optic nerve head\x1b[0m in a arcuate form (Fig. 00, streaming pink fibers).  The fovea is, of course, free of a nerve fiber layer as the inner retina and ganglion cells are pushed away to the foveal slope.  The central ganglion cell fibers run around the foveal slope and sweep in the direction of the optic nerve.  Peripheral ganglion cell axons continue this arcing course to the optic nerve with a dorso/ventral split along the horizontal meridian (Fig. 00).  Retinal topography is maintained in the optic nerve, through the lateral geniculate to the visual cortex. Fig. 00.  Schematic representation of the course of ganglion cell axons in the retina.  The retinotopic origin of these nerve fibers is respected throughout the visual pathway.  (Modified from Harrington DO, Drake MV.  The visual fields.  6th ed.

A fundus photograph showing the back of the retina. The white circle is the beginning of the optic nerve. The optic nerve is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glia. Each human optic nerve contains between 770,000 and 1.7 million nerve fibers, which are axons of the retinal ganglion cells of one retina.

The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species, and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species. Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex, while other axons terminate in the pretectal area and are involved in reflexive eye movements. Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.

The optic nerve component lengths are 1 mm in the globe, 24 mm in the orbit, 9 mm in the optic canal, and 16 mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm. There, partial decussation occurs, and about 53% of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts. Most of these fibers terminate in the lateral geniculate body. Based on this anatomy, the optic nerve may be divided into four parts as indicated in the image at the top of this section (this view is from above as if you were looking into the orbit after the top of the skull had been removed): 1. the optic head (which is where it begins in the eyeball (globe) with fibers from the retina); 2. orbital part (which is the part within the orbit); 3. intracanicular part (which is the part within a bony canal known as the optic canal); and, 4. cranial part (the part within the cranial cavity, which ends at the optic chiasm).

At the optic disc, the 3° visual afferents exit the eye and form the optic nerve. The fibers of the optic nerve that originate from ganglion cells in the nasal half of the retina (i.e., the nasal hemiretina) decussate in the optic chiasm to the opposite optic tract (Figure 15.1). Consequently, each optic tract contains retinal ganglion cell axons that originate in the nasal half of the contralateral retina and the temporal half of the ipsilateral retina.

For example, the temporal (left) hemiretina of left eye and the nasal (left) hemiretina of right eye both have projected on them the right halves of their respective visual fields. Consequently, each optic tract has within it axons representing the contralateral half of the visual field. The axons in the optic tract terminate in four nuclei within the brain (Figure 15.2): the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus - for visual perception; the superior colliculus of the midbrain - for control of eye movements; the pretectum of the midbrain - for control of the pupillary light reflex; and "", 'The ganglion cell axons run in the nerve fiber layer above the inner limiting membrane towards the optic nerve head in a arcuate form (Fig. 00, streaming pink fibers).

The gold also fired up the U.S. economy and fueled wild dreams like the construction of a cross-country railroad line. War with Mexico When the United States and Mexico went to war in 1846, California was under the loose control of the Mexican government. California's population consisted of about 6,500 Californios (people of Spanish or Mexican decent), 700 foreigners (primarily Americans), and 150,000 Native Americans, whose numbers had been cut in half since the arrival of the Spanish in 1769. The Californios lived on vast ranches that had been granted by the Mexican government.

Once the excitement of gold hunting calmed, people settled in the state, established businesses, and began farming to make ends meet. Events Leading Up to the California Gold Rush Illustration depicting the Mexican War of Independence, via Texas State Historical Association California was in a transitional period prior to the discovery of gold. Spain had ownership of the land up until the end of the Mexican War of Independence in 1821. As Spain was at the height of political turmoil in the early 19th century, the people of Mexico seized the opportunity of Spain’s fragile state to seek independence. Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla is largely responsible for sparking the revolution when he called for Mexican independence in a speech called the Grito de Dolores in September 1810.

People from small villages in the hills near Genova, Italy were among the first to settle permanently in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters. A modest number of miners of African ancestry (probably less than 4,000) had come from the Southern States, the Caribbean and Brazil. ', ""When the Gold Rush began, the California goldfields were peculiarly lawless places. When gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, California was still technically part of Mexico, under American military occupation as the result of the Mexican–American War. With the signing of the treaty ending the war on February 2, 1848, California became a possession of the United States, but it was not a formal 'territory' and did not become a state until September 9, 1850. California existed in the unusual condition of a region under military control. There was no civil legislature, executive or judicial body for the entire region. Local residents operated under a confusing and changing mixture of Mexican rules, American principles, and personal dictates.

As accounts of the discovery spread, residents of the thinly-populated West Coast poured into the gold fields and migrants swarmed in from the Far East, Mexico, South America, and the East Coast – which provided about 80 percent of the newcomers. The rush occurred because the gold mining industry was very labor intensive and was easy to enter due to modest capital requirements and laws which made acquiring a claim stake fairly simple. Many easterners went overland in wagon trains through undeveloped territory – a trip that took from April or May until September and cost around $200 at a time when laborers earned somewhat less than one dollar per day in the East. Others came by ship – either sailing around South America or sailing to Panama, crossing the isthmus, and then boarding another ship to San Francisco. The trip via Central America took six to eight weeks, but was very dangerous due to disease, an issue that abated when Cornelius Vanderbilt forged a path through Nicaragua in 1851 and William Henry Aspinwall completed a railroad across the Panamian isthmus in 1855. Sailing around Cape Horn could take from three to eight months depending on winds. After the arduous trip miners faced shockingly high prices for food, supplies, rent and other goods and services and endured mining camps that lacked basic sanitation. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_gold_rush\nThe California gold rush (1848–1855) was a gold rush that began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold \x1b[96m[2] brought approximately 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad\x1b[0m. The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy; the sudden population increase \x1b[96m[3] allowed California to go rapidly to statehood in the Compromise of 1850\x1b[0m. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population's decline from disease, starvation, and the California genocide. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_gold_rush\nIt is estimated that approximately 90,000 people arrived in California in 1849—about half by land and half by sea. Of these, perhaps 50,000 to 60,000 were Americans, and the rest were from other countries. By 1855, it is estimated at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world. The largest group continued to be Americans, but there were tens of thousands each of Mexicans, Chinese, Britons, Australians, French, and Latin Americans, together with many smaller groups of miners, such as African Americans, Filipinos, Basques and Turks. People from small villages in the hills near Genova, Italy were among the first to settle permanently in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters. A modest number of miners of African ancestry (probably less than 4,000) had come from the Southern States, the Caribbean and Brazil. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_gold_rush\nWhen the Gold Rush began, the California goldfields were peculiarly lawless places. When gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, California was still technically part of Mexico, under American military occupation as the result of the Mexican–American War. With the signing of the treaty ending the war on February 2, 1848, California became a possession of the United States, but it was not a formal 'territory' and did not become a state until September 9, 1850. California existed in the unusual condition of a region under military control. There was no civil legislature, executive or judicial body for the entire region. Local residents operated under a confusing and changing mixture of Mexican rules, American principles, and personal dictates. Lax enforcement of federal laws, such as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, encouraged the arrival of free blacks and escaped slaves. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_gold_rush\n\x1b[102m[4] Large-scale agriculture (California's second 'Gold Rush') began during this time\x1b[0m. \x1b[102m[5] Roads, schools, churches, and civic organizations quickly came into existence\x1b[0m. The vast majority of the immigrants were Americans. Pressure grew for better communications and political connections to the rest of the United States, leading to statehood for California on September 9, 1850, in the Compromise of 1850 as the 31st state of the United States.

142,586,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\nThe Constitution does not explicitly require the speaker to be an incumbent member of the House of Representatives, although every speaker thus far has been, and as a member the speaker also represents their district and retains the right to vote. The speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the vice president and ahead of the president pro tempore of the Senate. The 56th and current Speaker of the House is Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana. Selection The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress, biennially, after a general election, or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position during a congressional term. \x1b[92m[1] At the start of a new Congress, those voting to elect the speaker are representatives-elect, as a speaker must be selected before members are sworn in to office; the House of Representatives cannot organize or take other legislative actions until a speaker is elected\x1b[0m. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. In practice, each party's caucus or conference selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. \x1b[92m[2] To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of votes from the members present and voting\x1b[0m. If no candidate wins a majority, the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Representatives are free to vote for someone other than the candidate nominated by their party but generally do not, as the outcome of the election effectively demonstrates which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House. Representatives who choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominee usually vote for someone else in their party or vote 'present', in which case their vote does not count in tallying the vote positively or negatively. Anyone who votes for the other party's candidate could face serious consequences, as was the case when Democrat James Traficant voted for Republican Dennis Hastert in 2001 (107th Congress). In response, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority, and he lost all of his committee posts. Upon election, the new speaker is sworn in by the dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member. Additionally, it is customary for the outgoing speaker, or the minority leader, to hand the speaker's gavel to the new speaker, as a mark of the peaceful transition of power. Eligibility of non-members While every speaker of the House has been a sitting House member, Article I, Section II, Clause 5, of the U.S. Constitution, concerning the choosing of a speaker, does not explicitly state House membership as a requirement. As noted by the Congressional Research Service, non-members have, on multiple occasions since 1997, received votes in speaker elections. In 1787, while the proposed Constitution was being considered, Pennsylvania Congress of the Confederation Delegate Tench Coxe publicly wrote the following: The house of representatives is not, as the Senate, to have a president chosen for them from without their body, but are to elect their speaker from their own number . . . . "", ""https://www.congressionalinstitute.org/2020/12/28/how-the-house-elects-its-speaker-2/\nWhen the House convenes on the first day of a new Congress, it must first establish that there are enough Members-elect to achieve a quorum, the constitutionally mandated minimum number that must be present to conduct business. The second item of business—even before Members are sworn in—is the election of a Speaker. Until a Speaker is elected, the Clerk from the previous Congress presides over the House. The Clerk calls for nominations for Speakership candidates, and the chairs of the Republican Conference and Democratic Caucus make short speeches on behalf of their parties’ nominees. The Clerk then asks for any other nominations to be brought forward. Then the Clerk appoints tellers from among the Members-elect to record the votes, and the voting begins. \x1b[102m[3] Each Member-elect has the opportunity to vote when the Clerk calls his or her name\x1b[0m. Typically, the Member-elect responds by calling out the last name of the person they wish to be Speaker. They may also answer 'present,' a response that does not count as a vote for anyone but does contribute to a quorum. Or they could decline to respond at all, in which case they would be considered not voting. (The forgoing is a description of what usually occurs at the beginning of a Congress. Extraordinary circumstances may vary these proceedings. An extensive treatment of the process of electing a Speaker, including information about unusual events, is available in the Precedents of the United States House of Representatives.) The vote for Speaker is a rare instance where a verbal roll call is made of each Member.  The House usually records its votes by electronic means, which saves a lot of time and allows Members to vote at any time during the 15-17 minutes usually reserved for a roll call.  But the Speaker’s election is different, partly by tradition, but also because it is not a yes or no vote. In 2019, the Speakership vote took a little shy of 50 minutes, plus additional time to tally the result. To win the Speakership, a person must secure a simple majority of those present and voting. If each of the 435 Representatives-elect votes for a candidate, the majority would be 218. For each person who answers present or otherwise does not vote, the threshold to win a majority decreases. In effect, the threshold decreases by a vote for every two people who answer present or do not participate. So if 433 Members vote, a candidate would need 217 votes to win the Speakership.

The speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the vice president and ahead of the president pro tempore of the Senate. The 56th and current Speaker of the House is Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana. Selection The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress, biennially, after a general election, or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position during a congressional term. At the start of a new Congress, those voting to elect the speaker are representatives-elect, as a speaker must be selected before members are sworn in to office; the House of Representatives cannot organize or take other legislative actions until a speaker is elected. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. In practice, each party's caucus or conference selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of votes from the members present and voting. If no candidate wins a majority, the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Representatives are free to vote for someone other than the candidate nominated by their party but generally do not, as the outcome of the election effectively demonstrates which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House. Representatives who choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominee usually vote for someone else in their party or vote 'present', in which case their vote does not count in tallying the vote positively or negatively. Anyone who votes for the other party's candidate could face serious consequences, as was the case when Democrat James Traficant voted for Republican Dennis Hastert in 2001 (107th Congress). In response, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority, and he lost all of his committee posts. Upon election, the new speaker is sworn in by the dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member. Additionally, it is customary for the outgoing speaker, or the minority leader, to hand the speaker's gavel to the new speaker, as a mark of the peaceful transition of power. Eligibility of non-members While every speaker of the House has been a sitting House member, Article I, Section II, Clause 5, of the U.S. Constitution, concerning the choosing of a speaker, does not explicitly state House membership as a requirement. As noted by the Congressional Research Service, non-members have, on multiple occasions since 1997, received votes in speaker elections. In 1787, while the proposed Constitution was being considered, Pennsylvania Congress of the Confederation Delegate Tench Coxe publicly wrote the following: The house of representatives is not, as the Senate, to have a president chosen for them from without their body, but are to elect their speaker from their own number . . . . "", ""Historically, there have been several controversial elections to the speakership, such as the contest of 1839. In that case, even though the 26th United States Congress convened on December 2, the House could not begin the speakership election until December 14 because of an election dispute in New Jersey known as the 'Broad Seal War'. Two rival delegations, one Whig and the other Democrat, had been certified as elected by different branches of the New Jersey government. The problem was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority. Neither party agreed to permit a speakership election with the opposite party's delegation participating. Finally, it was agreed to exclude both delegations from the election and a speaker was finally chosen on December 17. "", ""The speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes legislation supported by the majority party. In pursuing this goal, the speaker may use their influence over the Rules committee, which is in charge of the business of the House. The speaker chairs the majority party's House steering committee, which selects the majority members of each House standing committee, including the Rules committee (although it's worth to note their appointment to the said committees must be ratified by a resolution of the full House). While the speaker is the functioning head of the House majority party, the same is not true of the president pro tempore of the Senate, whose office is primarily ceremonial and honorary. "", ""Receives, along with the president pro tempore of the Senate, written declarations that a U.S. president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, or is able to resume them, under Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Additionally, the speaker is second in the presidential line of succession under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, immediately after the vice president and before the president pro tempore of the Senate (who is followed by members of the president's Cabinet). Thus, if both the presidency and vice-presidency were vacant simultaneously, then the speaker would become acting president, after resigning from the House and as speaker. "", ""When the House convenes on the first day of a new Congress, it must first establish that there are enough Members-elect to achieve a quorum, the constitutionally mandated minimum number that must be present to conduct business. The second item of business—even before Members are sworn in—is the election of a Speaker. Until a Speaker is elected, the Clerk from the previous Congress presides over the House. The Clerk calls for nominations for Speakership candidates, and the chairs of the Republican Conference and Democratic Caucus make short speeches on behalf of their parties’ nominees. The Clerk then asks for any other nominations to be brought forward. Then the Clerk appoints tellers from among the Members-elect to record the votes, and the voting begins. Each Member-elect has the opportunity to vote when the Clerk calls his or her name. Typically, the Member-elect responds by calling out the last name of the person they wish to be Speaker. They may also answer 'present,' a response that does not count as a vote for anyone but does contribute to a quorum. Or they could decline to respond at all, in which case they would be considered not voting. (The forgoing is a description of what usually occurs at the beginning of a Congress.

"", ""And while we’re talking about Members-elect answering present: One practice that seems to be declining is that of nominees for the Speakership answering present when the Clerk calls upon them to cast their votes. In 2005, Hastert became the last of the official Republican or Democratic candidates to answer present. Since then, the Democratic candidate has been Nancy Pelosi and the Republican candidates have been John Boehner, Paul Ryan, and Kevin McCarthy. Pelosi’s consistent practice has been to vote for herself (both when she was elected Speaker and the defeated candidate). In 2007, Boehner voted for himself (when he was defeated). In subsequent elections, rather than answer 'present,' he did not participate in the vote. Paul Ryan did not vote in either of his two elections (both successful). Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy voted for himself in 2019.

There was Emma by Hot Chocolate which had moved up to number three, Paper Lace’s Billy Don’t Be A Hero had just come down from number one and Terry Jacks rose to the top with Seasons In The Sun – any ideas?  Well, they were all on the subject of death. This week I look at the song that had just dropped from number one. Billy Don’t Be A Hero was written by the songwriters Peter Callander and Mitch Murray who had met in the mid-sixties. Mitch had previously had success as the writer of How Do you Do It and I Like It for Gerry & The Pacemakers as well as the top three hits I’m Tellin’ you Now and You Were Made For Me by Freddie & The Dreams whereas Peter had co-written, with other songwriter, hits for Tom Jones, Cilla Black and Paul and Barry Ryan, but the first hit they wrote together was The Tremeloes’ 1967 number four hit Even The Bad Times Are Good. In January 1968 their song The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde, as sung by Georgie Fame, rose to the top slot giving them their first chart-topper and their first real story song. Just over three years later, another quality story song went to number two courtesy of Tony Christie’s I Did What I Did for Maria. Story songs seemed to be the way forward and in 1974, after seeing a film about the War between the States, came up with the idea of writing a song about a the American Civil War and a guy who wants to go off to war despite his fiancé begging him to stay. ', ""The war depicted in 'Billy, Don’t Be A Hero' isn’t the Vietnam War. It’s apparently supposed to be the American Civil War, though the song itself never quite makes that clear. That lack of specificity isn’t an accident. 'Billy, Don’t Be A Hero' is supposed to be an eternal story of military sacrifice, the kind of thing that can apply all across history. It’s not, of course. It’s an incoherent delusion, and it’s also a ferociously obnoxious piece of songcraft.

(Ten years before 'Billy, Don’t Be A Hero,' Murray co-wrote another #1, Freddie And The Dreamers’ 'I’m Telling You Now.')

Even though we had started to withdraw troops in ’71, it felt like the war was never going to end. That anxiety was kicked back up when in early ’74, the Paris Accord was rejected and the war was restarted by the Viet Cong to regain the territory it had previously lost. No one knew what to expect. Would we have to send troops back?

The song was written and composed by two British songwriters, Mitch Murray and Peter Callander. Because the song was released in 1974, it was associated by some listeners with the Vietnam War, though the war to which it actually refers is never identified in the lyrics. It has been suggested that the drum pattern, references to a marching band leading soldiers in blue, and 'riding out' (cavalry) refer to the American Civil War. For one of the band's performances on Top of the Pops they wore Union-style uniforms, as can be seen on YouTube and on 45 single record cover.

Billy – Don’t Be a Hero, by Paper Lace (their 1st and only #1) 3 weeks, from 10th – 31st March 1974 Before starting this blog, I never for a moment suspected that songs about soldiers going to/coming back from war would be such a prominent sub-genre of #1s. I count four: ‘Lay Down Your Arms’, ‘Distant Drums’, ‘Two Little Boys’, ‘Yellow River’, and that’s just off the top of my head.

In 1974, its anti-war message, couched in terms of the story of a Civil War soldier who leaves his fiancee to volunteer. The Heywood’s version hit number one in the US and Canada while the Paper Lace version hit number one in England, but never charted above number 96 on the US Hot 100. Inspired by Dylan’s Blowing in the Wind the legendary Sam Cooke wrote and recorded A Change is Gonna Come http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaNzxniXxYE Cooke was inspired to write the first draft following a sit-in protest in Durham North Carolina in 1963. The song was released following his death and was recorded and released later by Otis Redding.

Don McLean’s American Pie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr-BYVeCv6U is not really a protest song, but the poetry of the song which deals with the death of Buddy Holly in 1959 touches on a wide range of themes and issues of the 1960s and early 1970s.

There was Emma by Hot Chocolate which had moved up to number three, Paper Lace’s Billy Don’t Be A Hero had just come down from number one and Terry Jacks rose to the top with Seasons In The Sun – any ideas?  Well, they were all on the subject of death. This week I look at the song that had just dropped from number one. Billy Don’t Be A Hero was written by the songwriters Peter Callander and Mitch Murray who had met in the mid-sixties. Mitch had previously had success as the writer of How Do you Do It and I Like It for Gerry & The Pacemakers as well as the top three hits I’m Tellin’ you Now and You Were Made For Me by Freddie & The Dreams whereas Peter had co-written, with other songwriter, hits for Tom Jones, Cilla Black and Paul and Barry Ryan, but the first hit they wrote together was The Tremeloes’ 1967 number four hit Even The Bad Times Are Good. In January 1968 their song The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde, as sung by Georgie Fame, rose to the top slot giving them their first chart-topper and their first real story song. Just over three years later, another quality story song went to number two courtesy of Tony Christie’s I Did What I Did for Maria. Story songs seemed to be the way forward and in 1974, after seeing a film about the War between the States, came up with the idea of writing a song about a the American Civil War and a guy who wants to go off to war despite his fiancé begging him to stay.

It’s apparently supposed to be the American Civil War, though the song itself never quite makes that clear. That lack of specificity isn’t an accident. 'Billy, Don’t Be A Hero' is supposed to be an eternal story of military sacrifice, the kind of thing that can apply all across history. It’s not, of course. It’s an incoherent delusion, and it’s also a ferociously obnoxious piece of songcraft. 'Billy, Don’t Be A Hero' came from Mitch Murray and Peter Callender, two long-tenured British songwriters.
