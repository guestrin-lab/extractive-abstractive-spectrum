By Troy Bedinghaus, OD ', 'https://www.backoftheeyemd.com/what-is-hypertensive-retinopathy/\n\x1b[92m[3] Hypertensive retinopathy is damage to the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) caused by hypertension, or high blood pressure.\x1b[0m Hypertension damages the small blood vessels in the retina, causing their walls to thicken, which decreases the amount of blood that can flow through them. Patches of the retina may become damaged due to this inadequacy of blood flow. This is a photo of the back of an eye with hypertensive retinopathy. Note the yellow spots, which indicate areas of low blood flow due to abnormalities in the blood vessels. What are the risk factors? Risk factors for high blood pressure, and thus hypertensive retinopathy, include a high salt diet, obesity, tobacco use, alcohol use, stress, and family history. You can reduce your risk by leading a healthy lifestyle with regular diet and exercise. \x1b[92m[10] Routine blood pressure monitoring and medical treatment will prevent hypertensive retinopathy from developing.\x1b[0m Diagnostic Procedures ', 'https://assileye.com/blog/high-blood-pressure-and-vision/\nThe retina is the layer of tissue in the back of the eye responsible for collecting the light that enters the eye and sends signals to the brain to be converted into images. When this part of the eye is damaged, you may experience floaters, blurred vision, or vision loss. \x1b[92m[1] Damage to the retina due to high blood pressure is called hypertensive retinopathy.\x1b[0m The term refers to changes in the tiny blood vessels in the retina that may include leaking, fluid buildup, or decreased blood supply. High blood pressure may lead to other serious health problems, including heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and vision loss. Can you treat hypertensive retinopathy? \x1b[92m[11] Treating hypertensive retinopathy usually means controlling high blood pressure through lifestyle changes, medication, and careful monitoring.\x1b[0m By getting blood pressure under control early, you can prevent further damage and potential heart failure. In addition, with proper blood pressure management, existing damage may slowly heal.

Hypertension can cause damage to the blood vessels in the retina, the area at the back of the eye where images focus. This eye disease is known as hypertensive retinopathy. The damage can be serious if hypertension is not treated. A person typically won't experience symptoms of mild to moderate hypertensive retinopathy; it is usually discovered during a routine eye exam. Symptoms of more severe and accelerated hypertension might include headaches and vision problems. Severe retinopathy can occur alongside high blood pressure during pregnancy, so prenatal care is important. An eye care professional can diagnose hypertensive retinopathy. Using an ophthalmoscope, an instrument that projects light to examine the back of the eyeball, the doctor will look for signs of retinopathy that include: Narrowing of blood vessels Spots on the retina known as cotton wool spots and exudates Swelling of the macula (the central area of the retina) and optic nerve Bleeding in the back of the eye The best way to treat hypertensive retinopathy is to adequately control your blood pressure. \x1b[92m[4] To prevent hypertensive retinopathy, keep your blood pressure under control by reaching and maintaining your optimal weight, sticking with a diet recommended by your physician, exercising regularly, and faithfully taking your high blood pressure medications as prescribed.\x1b[0m In addition, see your doctor on a regular basis for follow-up care.""]",How can you prevent hypertensive retinopathy?,"To prevent hypertensive retinopathy, it is crucial to manage and control high blood pressure, which is the primary cause [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m.

1,80,"['https://www.allergyasthma.clinic/blog/5-benefits-of-allergy-shots\nOur team at Advanced Allergy & Asthma understands the importance of having well-controlled allergy symptoms. That’s why we provide on-site allergy shots — or immunotherapy — on-site to improve your quality of life. Here are a few benefits of allergy shots. 1. \x1b[92m[3] They reduce your sensitivity When you have allergies, your immune system overreacts, treating a harmless substance as a threat.\x1b[0m Elements that can trigger these reactions include: Mold Dust mites Pet dander Pollen Insect venom Allergy shots desensitize you to these triggers by introducing small and safe amounts to your body. Over time, you develop an immunity, similar to a vaccine, which decreases your allergy symptoms. 2. They work for a variety of allergies Allergy shots are also safe in children five years of age and older, and for people experiencing severe allergy symptoms all year round. We recommend allergy shots for numerous allergic conditions, including: Seasonal allergies, including hayfever and allergic asthma ', 'https://www.allergyweb.com/es/educacion/alergia/shots/\nIf you are able to avoid the trigger of your allergies or if usual doses of medications control your symptoms, then immunotherapy might not be needed. While allergy shots have been proven effective against inhalant allergies and stinging insect allergies, they are not used for food allergies. If any of the following applies to you, then you may be a candidate for allergy shots: If the medications to control your symptoms (i.e., antihistamines, decongestants), do not work. If the medication used to control your symptoms produces too many side effects. If complications (i.e., sinus infections, ear infections) develop. \x1b[92m[0] If you have asthma triggered by allergies.\x1b[0m If you are at risk of developing anaphylaxis (a severe reaction that, in some cases, may be fatal) when exposed to an allergen. (As noted above – allergy shots are not used for food allergy.) If medications control your symptoms, but your symptoms flare back up every time you try to reduce your medications. ', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/in-depth/allergies-and-asthma/art-20047458\nLeukotriene modifier. This type of medication can ease both allergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms. Called a leukotriene modifier, this daily pill helps control immune system chemicals released during an allergic reaction. Montelukast (Singulair) is the leukotriene modifier that can treat both asthma and allergic rhinitis. Allergy shots (immunotherapy). \x1b[92m[4] Allergy shots can help treat asthma by gradually reducing your immune-system response to certain allergy triggers.\x1b[0m Immunotherapy involves getting regular injections of a tiny amount of the allergens that trigger your symptoms. Your immune system builds up a tolerance to the allergens over time, and your allergic reactions diminish. In turn, asthma symptoms decrease as well. This treatment generally requires regular injections over a period of time. ', 'https://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/allergies-asthma\nAsthma attacks (worsening of asthma symptoms) can be triggered by allergies, which can temporarily increase the inflammation of the airways in a susceptible person. An allergy is the immune system\'s reaction when exposed to what is otherwise a harmless substance, such as plant pollen, mold, or animal hair, skin or saliva. The immune system acts as a body defense, yet for people with allergies, the immune system treats these substances, called ""allergens,"" as if they are harmful, causing a disruption to normal body functions. Allergens are what trigger a series of reactions by the immune system during an allergic reaction. Inhaled Allergens. The most important allergens for people with allergic asthma appear to be those asthma triggers that are inhaled. Hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs when a person comes in contact with an allergen or a substance that he or she is sensitive to. Common inhaled allergens include: Animal dander (skin, saliva) Dust mites Cockroach particles Mold Pollen Medical experts recommend that all people with allergies and asthma try to identify possible inhaled allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms. Food Allergies. Food allergies rarely cause asthma yet they can cause a severe life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. The condition can lead to symptoms that include difficulty breathing, wheezing, an itchy rash, low blood pressure, and vomiting. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow\'s milk Peanuts Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, walnuts) Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Food preservatives can also trigger allergic and asthmatic reactions. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and may be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods If you suspect that certain foods may be the cause of your asthma, discuss this with your doctor. Allergy skin testing can be done to determine if you are allergic to these foods. If you have allergies and asthma, avoid the substance you are allergic to. Here are some tips to help you avoid some of the most common allergens and prevent asthma attack symptoms. Dust Mites Encase pillows, mattresses, and box springs with allergen-proof, zippered covers. Wash all bedding in hot water once a week. Non-carpeted flooring is best. If you cannot get rid of your carpeting, vacuum often with an HEPA filter. Wear a mask while vacuuming. If your child has asthma, do not vacuum while he or she is in the room. Products that eliminate dust mites from carpeting (such as Acarosan) can be purchased. Your asthma care provider can give you information about these products. Avoid curtains and drapes. Use plain window shades instead of mini-blinds. Washable curtains should be washed in hot water every two to four weeks. Dust all surfaces with a damp cloth often, including lampshades and windowsills. Keep clutter under control. Toys and books should be stored in enclosed bookshelves, drawers or closets. Replace traditional stuffed animals with washable stuffed animals. Keep all clothing in drawers and closets. Keep drawers and closets closed. Cover air ducts with filters. Change these when soiled. Pillows and bedding should not contain feathers. Keep indoor humidity low (below 50%). Use a dehumidifier if needed. Regularly change filters on heaters and air conditioners. Mold and Mildew Air out damp, humid areas frequently. Run a dehumidifier to keep humidity between 35% and 45%. Use air conditioners when possible. Clean bathrooms regularly using products that kill and prevent mold. Use exhaust fans to vent steam. Do not carpet the bathroom. Keep indoor plants out of bedrooms. When painting, add mold inhibitor to paint to prevent mold from growing. Avoid sources of outdoor molds, such as wet leaves or garden debris. To clean visible mold use a cleaning solution containing bleach ( one ounce per quart of water). Insects Many homes and apartments have cockroaches and other insects. Some people with asthma are allergic to a protein in their droppings. To control these allergens in your home: Use roach baits or traps. Insect sprays can be used, but should only be sprayed when no one is at home. Before you or your child returns home after spraying, make sure that your home has been aired out for a couple of hours. Because cockroaches thrive in high humid environment, fix water leaks in and around your home. Cover food in lidded or sealed containers. Clean dishes after eating. Sweep floors after you have eaten. Pollen Pollen is a tiny egg shaped cell from flowering plants. Pollens are difficult to avoid because they cannot be eliminated from the atmosphere. Plants have different periods of pollination, which varies little from year to year. Yet, the type of weather affects the amount of pollen in the air with hot, dry, and windy weather causing more pollen in the air. In general pollen season starts from February to October. You can lessen your or your child\'s exposure to pollen by: Limiting your or your child\'s outdoor activities during times of high pollen, such as early morning. Having him wear a hat outdoors, washing his hands and face when he comes inside, and having him change his clothes after being outside. Staying indoors during dry or windy days when pollen counts are high. Keeping windows closed during pollen seasons. Using air conditioning if possible. Pet Dander It is best not to own any pets if you or your child is highly allergic to pet dander. Long visits to friends and family who own pets should be avoided. If you do visit, make sure you or your child takes asthma or allergy medicines before the visit. Exposure to the pets should be kept to a minimum when visiting. If you must have a cat or dog in the home, restrict its living area. It should not be allowed in your or your child\'s bedroom at any time. If possible, keep the pet outside. Wash your pet weekly. Remove as much carpeting as possible. Animal dander deposits in the carpet and stays there, even after the pet is gone from the home. Food Allergies If you have allergies, avoiding food triggers can be challenging. It is important to always read food labels and, when dining out, ask how foods are prepared. Consider Allergy Shots You can train your immune system to not overreact to allergy triggers. \x1b[92m[1] Doctors do this by giving you allergy shots (immunotherapy) for asthma.\x1b[0m An allergy shot is a small amount of the substance that causes your allergy. By giving repeated shots of the substance over a period of time, your immune system eventually stops causing the allergic reaction. \x1b[92m[2] Ask your doctor if you are a candidate for allergy shots for preventing asthma.\x1b[0m']",Should I get allergy shots if I have asthma?,"If you have asthma triggered or worsened by allergies, allergy shots (immunotherapy) might be beneficial [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.

2,196,"['https://www.webmd.com/palliative-care/siblings-of-children-with-serious-illnesses\nWhen a child is seriously ill, the focus of the whole family shifts. During long hospital stays or intense treatments, as parents spend a great deal of time outside of the home, brothers and sisters of a sick child can sometimes feel forgotten. Palliative care teams, also known as pediatric advanced care ( PAC) teams, partner with families to address the range of typical emotions that siblings of a seriously ill child may experience. A sick child\'s sisters and brothers often feel left out or ignored. Here are a few ways parents can make sure their other children feel included, needed, and attended to: Find ways to let the siblings participate at home and at the hospital. Give them some way to help out at home, but don\'t ask them to take on a parent-like role. They need simple, age-appropriate tasks that contribute to the day-to-day functioning of the household, so they know they are needed. \x1b[92m[2] At times when children may not be permitted to visit the hospital, ask siblings to draw pictures or make cards to put in the sick child\'s room.\x1b[0m Ask them to collect some of the sick child\'s personal items, such as books or stuffed animals, to be sent to the hospital. Answer the siblings\' questions. Provide age-appropriate answers that are truthful, concrete, and thorough (but you don\'t need to provide more information than the child is asking for). No matter how hard parents try to protect their children from the reality of the situation, children frequently know when something is going on, and they will certainly have questions. Parents with the best intentions often evade their children\'s questions -- which adds to the children feeling excluded. Acknowledge sibling relationships. When a family is grieving the illness or the loss of a child, it may seem to siblings that the focus is on the parents\' relationship with the child. The brothers and sisters have a vital relationship with their sick sibling, too, and that relationship should be acknowledged. \x1b[92m[0] If a family is mourning the loss of a child, specialists recommend that siblings, not only parents, keep memorabilia from the child, such as a lock of hair, a favorite doll, or photographs.\x1b[0m Feeling excluded can naturally lead to jealousy. Siblings may even wish a sick sibling would die. Then, if their sibling\'s condition does not improve, or worsens, the well siblings feel guilty or perhaps responsible. Children ages 3 to 6 years are particularly susceptible. They are what experts call ""magical thinkers,"" who believe their thoughts have the power to hurt others. A magical thinker who feels jealous of a sibling or wishes for a sibling\'s death can feel responsible if his sibling\'s condition does not improve. The sibling\'s condition may even appear to be punishment for something the magical thinker did. Children at this age are capable of thinking, "" Yesterday I stole my brother\'s toy, and today my brother is even sicker. It\'s my fault."" Parents can combat the feelings that lead to jealousy and guilt by making sure children feel included and loved and by assuring children that their feelings are normal. Parents should make clear to children of all ages, and magical thinkers in particular, that they had nothing to do with their sibling\'s illness. Most children just want things to go back to normal. Parents should make every effort to keep siblings on their regular schedules for school, mealtimes, bedtimes, and extra-curricular activities. Parents will need to rely on trusted family members and friends to ensure that this happens. Palliative care social workers note that sometimes families want to keep their child\'s condition to themselves and not ask for help. This is nearly impossible -- and could be detrimental to the well-being of the other children. When children must be taken out of their normal comfort zones -- for hospital visits or perhaps for serious talks about the circumstances -- they should be permitted to leave the situation at any time. For example, if children would like to visit their sibling in the hospital, they should be accompanied by an adult who can take them out of the room as soon as they are ready. Child life specialists can serve this function, or the child can come to the hospital accompanied by a relative or family friend. Children who attend the memorial service of a child who dies should come with an adult who can take them away from the service at any time they ask to leave. \x1b[92m[1] Parents might be hurt when a child wants to leave the bedside or funeral of a sibling, but this is a normal response -- not an indication of indifference on the child\'s part.\x1b[0m Children are not capable of absorbing all the implications of a painful situation all at once as adults are. They don\'t have the frame of reference that increased life experience provides. While reality sets in, the children will want to return to what\'s normal for them. Children may show a similar desire to get back to regular activities when parents try to have a serious talk. For example, after a parent explains a sibling\'s diagnosis, the child may ask to go back to playing. This doesn\'t mean the child hasn\'t heard or understood. Experts advise parents to honor the child\'s request and participate in the activity in case questions arise. The range of emotions felt during a sibling\'s illness can lead to distress. Parents should take the following behaviors as an indication that children are distressed, and that their feelings should be addressed. All Ages: Children of any age can regress to past behaviors, such as bed wetting, thumb sucking, or wanting to sleep in their parents\' bed. 6- to 9-year-olds: Nightmares Violent play Aggression Playing the role of the sick or deceased family member Confusion about his own role, i.e. "" Am I the big brother now or am I still the middle brother?"" 9- to 12-year-olds: Problems in school, behavioral and/or academic Aggression Withdrawal from regular activities Extreme weight change and eating disorders Suicidal thoughts Teens: Anger Guilt Weight change and eating disorders Substance abuse Opposition to or defiance of parents; struggling to become more independent from parents while parents may cling more to the child Suicidal thoughts Many hospitals have groups or organized therapeutic activities for siblings of seriously ill children. Caregivers also refer families to community resources, including summer camps and other recreational programs. Pediatric psychiatrists and licensed clinical social workers are trained to help families manage grief and the demands of caring for a chronically ill child Child-life specialists give individualized attention to siblings of sick children. They help identify siblings\' needs, talk to them about difficult topics, and coach parents on how to talk to their kids and answer their questions. Specialists also prepare children to visit a sibling in the hospital, explain procedures and diagnoses using props, and offer expressive outlets through guided art and play activities. With parents\' permission, specialists can work with the children\'s schools. Experts stress the importance of letting school teachers know what\'s happening. Teachers can then look for and understand signs of distress. PAC specialists can coach teachers and counselors on how to address the needs of siblings and other students impacted by the circumstances. They can also can give presentations for the classmates of sick children and their siblings. Chronic or life-limiting conditions bring a host of new responsibilities for parents.

3,166,"[""https://www.dignityhealth.org/conditions-and-treatments/orthopedics/common-arm-conditions-and-injuries/broken-arm\nA fractured arm bone may be a partial or complete break. In younger people, it is common to experience 'green stick' fractures, in which the bone break resembles a green, bendable stick that has been broken until it partially breaks. Fractures can also be described as closed or open. In a closed fracture, the bones do not break through the skin. If bones are poking through the skin, this is called an open fracture and should be cared for immediately. Risk factors Broken arms are most common during athletic activity, such as skiing, biking, and contact sports like football and rugby. Aging-related conditions like osteoporosis, which is a condition that weakens your bones, may also put you at increased risk for breaking your arm. Prevention Most events that lead to broken bones are accidental, so it can be hard to prevent a broken arm completely. \x1b[92m[2] You can, however, take steps to build up bone strength, try to avoid falls, and wear the proper protective equipment for sports.\x1b[0m "", 'https://www.uofmhealthsparrow.org/departments-conditions/conditions/broken-arm\nEat for bone strength. Eat a healthy diet that includes calcium-rich foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese, and vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from fatty fish, such as salmon; from fortified foods, such as milk and orange juice; and from sun exposure. Exercise for bone strength. \x1b[92m[0] Weight-bearing physical activity and exercises that improve balance and posture can strengthen bones and reduce the chance of a fracture.\x1b[0m The more active and fit you are as you age, the less likely you are to fall and break a bone. Prevent falls. To prevent falling, wear sensible shoes. Remove home hazards that can cause you to trip, such as area rugs. Make sure your living space is well lit. Install grab bars in your bathroom and handrails on your stairways, if necessary. Use protective gear.

This means acknowledging all attempts at communication from the child, whether these are sounds, gestures, or facial expressions. Responding positively to these attempts not only validates their efforts but also encourages them to continue trying to communicate. \x1b[92m[0] In addition, routines and predictability can be very beneficial for children with PID.\x1b[0m Regular schedules and consistent routines can help the child understand what's coming next and can reduce anxiety or confusion. Within these routines, specific cues related to the activities can be consistently used to help the child associate the cues with the actions or activities. It can also be helpful to use 'total communication' - a combination of speech, gestures, signs, and pictures to reinforce communication. This approach encourages the use of all possible modes of communication, giving the child multiple ways to express themselves and understand others. "", ""https://behaviourhelp.com/behaviour-blog/positive-behaviour-support/exploring-non-verbal-communication-a-definition,-challenges-and-losing-the-ability-to-speak-as-an-adult\nMoreover, it's important to model appropriate non-verbal behaviours. \x1b[92m[3] Caregivers and educators can intentionally use clear, exaggerated facial expressions and gestures as they communicate.\x1b[0m Over time, this can help the child learn to associate these non-verbal cues with specific meanings. Lastly, patience and understanding are key. It's important to allow the child enough time to process information and respond. Rushing the child or showing frustration may discourage them from attempting to communicate. Every child is unique and will develop at their own pace, so celebrating every little progress is crucial for their self-confidence and motivation. By adopting these strategies, caregivers, educators, and parents can provide the necessary support to children with PID to help them navigate the challenges of non-verbal communication. Becoming Non Verbal Later in Life "", ""https://behaviourhelp.com/behaviour-blog/positive-behaviour-support/exploring-non-verbal-communication-a-definition,-challenges-and-losing-the-ability-to-speak-as-an-adult\nHowever, it's important to remember that while an individual may lose their ability to speak, they haven't lost their ability to communicate. \x1b[92m[2] Non-verbal communication methods can be used, such as gestures, facial expressions, and body language.\x1b[0m Writing or typing can also be options if the individual's physical capabilities allow. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, which can range from simple picture boards to sophisticated electronic devices that generate speech, can also be used to facilitate communication. Psychologically, becoming non-verbal as an adult can be a difficult transition. There may be feelings of frustration, sadness, or anxiety associated with not being able to verbally express oneself or fear of being misunderstood or overlooked. It may affect a person's sense of identity and independence, and might also change dynamics in personal and professional relationships. "", 'https://behaviourhelp.com/behaviour-blog/positive-behaviour-support/exploring-non-verbal-communication-a-definition,-challenges-and-losing-the-ability-to-speak-as-an-adult\nUnderstanding and using non-verbal communication is particularly crucial for individuals with Profound Intellectual Disabilities (PID), as it often serves as their primary means of expression and connection. The complexity of their needs calls for a comprehensive and individualised approach that leverages various strategies to support their communication development. These strategies range from providing consistent routines, to using Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems, to fostering a responsive environment that values and encourages their attempts at communication. However, challenges abound, especially when it comes to interpreting non-verbal cues. Difficulties in this area can lead to struggles in social interaction, learning, and emotional understanding, among others. \x1b[92m[1] But with adequate support, patience, and understanding, individuals with PID can improve their communication skills and enhance their quality of life.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.webmd.com/parkinsons-disease/guide/parkinsons-speech-therapy\nDysarthria (difficulty speaking) and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) can be severely limiting symptoms of Parkinson\'s disease. Both can be helped by seeing a speech pathologist or speech therapist. In particular, the Lee Silverman Voice Therapy Program, has demonstrated significant value for people with Parkinson\'s. Ask your doctor about a referral to a speech pathologist experienced in administering the Lee Silverman Voice Therapy program. Speech-language pathologists can help people with Parkinson\'s disease maintain as many communication skills as possible. They also teach techniques that conserve energy, including non-verbal communication skills. Speech-language pathologists are also available to: Recommend appropriate communication technologies that will help with daily activities. Treat all types of speech, language, and communication problems. Evaluate swallowing function and recommend changes as necessary. Choose an environment with reduced noise. It can be tiring to try to ""talk over"" the television or radio. Speak slowly. Be certain your listener can see your face. Look at the person while you are talking. A well-lit room enhances face-to-face conversation, increasing understanding. Use short phrases. Say one or two words or syllables per breath. Over-articulate your speech by prolonging the vowels and exaggerating the consonants. Choose a comfortable posture and position that provide support during long and stressful conversations. Be aware that exercises intended to strengthen weakening muscles may be counter-productive. Always ask your speech therapist which exercises are right for you. Plan periods of vocal rest before planned conversations or phone calls. Know that fatigue significantly affects your speaking ability. Techniques that work in the morning may not work later in the day. If you are soft spoken and your voice has become low, consider using an amplifier. If some people have difficulty understanding you, the following strategies may help: If you are able to write without difficulty, always carry a paper and pen as a backup so you can write down what you are trying to say. If writing is difficult, use an alphabet board to point or scan to the first letter of the words that are spoken. Spell words out loud or on an alphabet board if they are not understood. Establish the topic before speaking. Use telegraphic speech. Leave out unnecessary words to communicate the meaning of the topic. Nonverbal communication, also called augmentative and alternative communication ( AAC), is a method of communicating without spoken words. When communication needs cannot be met through speech, the following techniques can help: Make the best use out of what speaking ability is left. Use expressions and gestures to communicate. \x1b[92m[4] Non-verbal communication can help people with speech difficulties actually speak better by: Reducing the frustration and stress of being unable to communicate.\x1b[0m Alleviating the pressure to speak. Allowing the person to be more relaxed and come across in a more understandable manner. Here\'s a sample of the devices that are available to help people with Parkinson\'s disease communicate more clearly. Palatal lift. A dental apparatus that is similar to a retainer. It lifts the soft palate and stops air from escaping out of the nose during speech. Amplification. A personal amplifier can be used to increase the volume of the voice. The amplifier also decreases voice fatigue. TTY telephone relay system. A telephone equipped with a keyboard so speech can be typed and read by a relay operator to the listener. Either the whole message can be typed or just the words that are not understood can be typed. Low technology devices. Notebooks and language boards can be used as an alternative communication techniques. High technology electronic speech enhancers, communication devices. Computers with voice synthesizers and dedicated communication devices are available. If you are interested in purchasing an electronic communication aid discuss this with your speech therapist before contacting sales representatives for these devices. Use an intercom system or baby monitor to alert others that there is an emergency. Use bells or buzzers if you are not able to speak. Use ""codes"" that signify urgency. For example, a tinkling bell may mean, "" I\'d like company"" while an air-horn means there\'s an emergency. Carry a portable phone that is equipped with pre-programmed numbers. Pre-program all of your telephones so they can automatically dial the necessary emergency number(s). Consider a ""life call"" button if you spend time alone.']",How can non-verbal communication help if you have trouble speaking with Parkinson's disease?,"Non-verbal communication can be incredibly beneficial for individuals with Parkinson's disease who face challenges with speech [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m.

To do it, you use a gadget that pricks your finger with a tiny needle. You'll put a drop of blood onto a test strip. The strip goes into a handheld device that measures your blood sugar level. Record the test results, so you can share it with your doctor. Based on your results, the two of you may adjust your diet, exercise, or medication. \x1b[92m[4] A1c Test: This is a blood test you'll get in your doctor's office at least twice a year, or as often as he recommends.\x1b[0m The results show your average blood sugar control for the past 2 to 3 months. You and your doctor need this test to see how well your diabetes treatment plan is working, so you can make changes if you need to. Think of it this way: Self-checking is like a daily snapshot of your blood sugar control. The A1c test gives you the big picture. Continuous Glucose Monitoring System: If you choose this method, your doctor will place a tiny sensor under your skin to check blood sugar levels every 5 minutes. It sends data to a monitor that you wear like a pager for a few days. You'll still need to check your levels throughout the day; continuous glucose monitoring doesn't replace that.

Stop smoking: In addition to increasing your risk for conditions such as lung cancer and heart disease, nicotine can slow the production of cells that create bone in the body. Smoking can also interfere with your body’s ability to absorb calcium, which is critical for maintaining bone strength. \x1b[92m[2] Limit alcohol: Excess alcohol can destroy cells that make new bone, slowing the bone renewal process.\x1b[0m Alcohol can also increase parathyroid hormone, which triggers a loss of calcium and a decrease in overall bone mass and strength.

He was therefore diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia as a result of persistent internal hemorrhoid bleeding. Although the extent of hemoglobin level of 1.7g/dl, in this case, is extremely rare and noteworthy, the doctors stated that iron-deficiency anemia caused by hemorrhoids is not uncommon. Is there a treatment for anemia? Although taking supplements such as iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid tablets can stop the bleeding, the anemia may still persist. \x1b[92m[4] Iron tablets can occasionally cause constipation and a change in stool color, and some people may not feel comfortable taking them for months.\x1b[0m A treatment plan that only includes treatment for anemia may not be sufficient if they already have anemia because they may end up aggravating it.

Constipation is the main cause of hemorrhoids. In addition, as pregnancy progresses, the uterus expands and puts pressure on the veins in and around the anus, causing them to swell. Hemorrhoids can be very uncomfortable. They can cause itching and mild bleeding. Prevention There are several ways to relieve constipation. Since hemorrhoids often develop after a period of constipation, they can also be avoided by following these recommendations. Diet Fibre facilitates intestinal function. Some types of fibre bulk up your stool, which speeds up its passage through the intestine. Other types attract water to the stool. In both cases, the fibre makes your stool softer and easier to pass. As such, pregnant women should increase their fibre intake by 2 to 3 g per day for a total of 28 g. The following foods are high in fibre: ', 'https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/best-worst-foods-hemorrhoids\n"" Eat more fiber."" "" Stay hydrated."" That\'s the advice everyone gets about hemorrhoids -- and it\'s good. But what does it mean in real life, when you\'re at the grocery store or deciding what to put on your plate? Let\'s take a look at specific foods that can help this painful problem and ways to work them into your meals. And on the flip side, what you may want to stay away from. Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like goo. ( Picture what happens to oats when you mix them with water.) You want this stuff. It makes your stool soft, well-formed, and easy to pass. No constipation, little irritation. Sounds like the Holy Grail of poop, right? Insoluble fiber is what your grandmother would call ""roughage."" It doesn\'t dissolve. ( If you drop a chunk of celery in water, it just sits there.) It helps to keep things moving through -- and out of -- your system and to balance the chemistry in your intestines. Many ""high-fiber"" foods have both kinds. You should aim for 25-30 grams or more of fiber every day from what you eat, about twice what most Americans get. In general, you\'ll want about a third of that to be soluble (more when you have diarrhea). Too much fiber too fast can cause gas and bloating, so add a little bit to your diet at a time if you\'re not used to it. You\'ll also need to drink more fluids to help your body use that fiber: 8-10 large glasses (at least a half-gallon) of water every day. You\'ll get a lot of bang for your bite with the legume family. Just 1/2 cup of beans -- such as kidney, navy, lima, or black beans -- will cover about a third of your daily goal. It will have between 7 and 10 grams of fiber (both soluble and insoluble), depending on which variety you choose. About 20 almonds or pecans have around 3 grams of fiber. A 1/2 cup of edamame does, too, and it only has about half the calories. Instead of using just meat in chili and soups, add or substitute beans. You can also use beans and nuts in salads. Try Indian and Middle Eastern recipes, which often call for beans, lentils, and peas. Swap white breads, pastas, and crackers for versions made with whole-grain flours, buckwheat, stone-ground cornmeal, or rye to boost the amount of insoluble fiber you\'ll get. Cooked oats and barley will give you soluble fiber, too. Instead of a plain white bagel for breakfast, have a packet of instant oatmeal -- with twice the fiber for less than half the calories. Reach for no-butter popcorn when you get the munchies. Sprinkle oat bran or wheat germ on salads and soups. You can\'t go wrong with plant foods. Keep the skins on when they\'re thin, like on apples, pears, plums, and potatoes. That\'s where the insoluble fiber is, as well as compounds called flavonoids that can help control hemorrhoid bleeding. Brightly colored produce -- berries, grapes, tomatoes, and kale and other dark, leafy greens -- are generally rich in flavonoids. And the fresher, the better. Try to keep them whole and not damage the skins or leaves until you\'re ready to eat them. Avoid cooking to the point that their color fades. A serving of fruit is often good for at least 10% of your daily fiber, usually 3 to 4 grams. A cup of leafy greens, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, winter squash, or green peas will get you 4 to 5 grams of fiber. Some veggies and fruits have fiber plus a lot of water. Cucumbers, celery, mild bell peppers, and watermelon are mostly water -- more than 90%. Make a habit of adding another fruit or vegetable to any meal, like berries or bananas in your cereal, apple chunks on your salad, spinach in your omelet, or grated zucchini in your spaghetti sauce. Snack on dried fruits like figs, apricots, and dates. Swap sugary baked desserts for fresh fruit -- raw strawberries rather than strawberry pie. Foods with little fiber can cause or make constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids) worse, so it\'s best to limit how much you eat of them. White bread and bagels Milk, cheese, and other dairy Meat Processed foods such as frozen meals and fast food Watch the amount of salt you eat. It can lead to your body hanging on to water, which puts more pressure on your blood vessels.

It is usually made from a polymer called xylan, extracted from forestry or agricultural waste, like birch tree scraps or corncobs. The xylan is then further processed into xylitol. The xylitol produced this way has an identical chemical structure to that found naturally in raspberries and other fruits and veggies. Thus, it is considered to be a natural sweetener even though it is processed considerably for production in large quantities. It is sometimes used also in processed foods and baked goods marketed as low-sugar or no-sugar alternatives. Check the ingredients on the label. Is Xylitol Safe for Humans?

Although it has been used as a sugar substitute for decades, its popularity has increased dramatically in the last decade due to its low glycemic index and dental plaque fighting properties. Where is xylitol found?Xylitol is manufactured into a white powder that looks and tastes similar to sugar. In many countries it has been approved for use in oral care products, pharmaceuticals, and as a food additive. Over recent years, the number and types of products that contain xylitol has greatly increased. Example products include sugar-free gum, candies, breath mints, baked goods, peanut butter, pudding snacks, cough syrup, chewable or gummy vitamins, and supplements or over the counter medications, mouthwash, and toothpaste. Xylitol is also showing up in over-the-counter nasal sprays, skin care products, laxatives, digestive aids, allergy medicines, dry mouth lozenges, sleep supplements, as well as prescription human medications, especially those formulated as quick dissolve tablets or liquids. Why is xylitol increasing in popularity and use?Xylitol has the same sweetness as sucrose but contains only about two-thirds the calories. As a sugar substitute, it is lower on the glycemic index, a scale that ranks carbohydrate-rich foods by how much they raise blood sugar levels, compared to glucose. Being lower on the glycemic index makes xylitol useful for diabetics or people on low carbohydrate diets. With respect to oral health, research has shown that xylitol helps reduce the formation of plaque, inhibits dental cavities, and stimulates the production of saliva. How safe is xylitol?Xylitol is safe for use in people, although like most sugar alcohols, it may have a mild laxative effect when eaten in large amounts or when first introduced to a diet. This occurs because xylitol can pull water into the intestines, or it can be fermented by bacteria present in the intestines.

As part of human metabolic processes, our bodies actually produce several grams of xylitol each day. The US Food and Drug Administration allows 'sugar-free' labeling of products sweetened only with sugar alcohols, artificial sweeteners, or a combination of these. Liz presents: Microorganisms do not readily metabolize xylitol into energy sources (in other words they do not use xylitol for energy creation thus encouraging microorganism growth).

As an additive, xylitol is found most often in chewing gum and mints. Similar in sweetness and volume to sugar, the granular form of xylitol can be used in many of the same ways as sugar, including to sweeten cereals, jams and hot beverages. It can even substitute sugar in baking, except when sugar is needed to help yeast rise. Check the ingredients to see if a product contains xylitol.

It tends to absorb more moisture than sugar, which could leave your cakes and cookies as dry as sawdust.  Yeast cannot metabolize Xylitol, so it will not work in yeast breads. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry weighs in: ', ""https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/xylitol-uses-and-risks\nXylitol is a carbohydrate found in the birch tree and several kinds of fruit. It has a chemical structure that looks like a cross between a sugar and an alcohol, but it is neither. Xylitol is a sugar-free sweetener added to some foods. It's nearly as sweet as sugar (sucrose), but has fewer calories. People with diabetes sometimes use xylitol as a sugar substitute. Blood sugar levels stay at a more constant level with xylitol than with regular sugar. This is because it is absorbed more slowly by the body. Some types of gum or oral care products, such as toothpaste and mouthwash, also contain xylitol. Mouth bacteria can't use xylitol as a source of energy, so it may help prevent tooth decay and the buildup of plaque. Researchers have studied the use of xylitol to prevent sudden attacks of middle ear inflammation (otitis media) in children with frequent earaches. One way it may help is by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. More studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness for this and other uses. Optimal doses of xylitol have not been set for any condition. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely from maker to maker. This makes it difficult to set a standard dose. Xylitol is extracted from plant material. \x1b[92m[12] The amount naturally found in foods is very small.\x1b[0m However, it is increasingly found as an ingredient (additiive) in more and more foods and health products. In addition to gum, xylitol can be found in some hard candies, chocolate, table syrup, jams, jellies, baked goods, cough syrup, vitamins, some nut butters, over-the-counter medications and many others. Xylitol is mostly safe, especially if taken in amounts found in food. The FDA has approved xylitol as a food additive or sweetener. Side effects. If you take large amounts of xylitol, such as 30 to 40 grams, you may experience diarrhea or gas. Increasing the dose gradually may help minimize these effects. Risks.

In addition, fiber promotes muscle contractions in the intestines that help move stool forward. Fiber also plays a vital role in maintaining the gut microbiome, which is the healthy balance between harmful and beneficial bacteria in your digestive system. Nature's Laxatives: Prunes, Sweet Potatoes, and Chia Seeds The Laxative Effect of Sorbitol in Prunes Prunes are the dried form of plums, which many consider one of the best natural laxatives. \x1b[92m[1] Prunes can help you have smoother and more regular bowel movements.\x1b[0m This is because dried prunes contain about 6.1 grams of dietary fiber per 100 grams. Even though prune juice doesn’t contain the same amount of fiber as the fruit itself, it is still considered helpful for constipation relief and a good source of minerals and vitamins, just like the fruits. "", ""https://www.webmd.com/ibs/diet-solution-ibs\nIf you have IBS- C, you may be concerned about what to eat. You need to keep a balanced diet while you avoid foods that trigger symptoms for you. Try a few simple tips to make your diet work better for you. An IBS symptom journal can help you and your doctor figure out which foods may trigger your symptoms. Make a habit of writing down any symptoms you might have, along with what and how much you ate beforehand. If you see a pattern with certain foods, see if you feel better when you don't eat them, or cut back on how much of them you eat. But cut foods one at a time. If you cut several foods at the same time, you won't know for sure which one may be causing your symptoms. These tips can help you come up with your own healthy new meal plan: Limit highly refined foods. These foods lose some important nutrients in the process of making them. They fill you up but don't give you the fiber, vitamins, and minerals you need. Think twice before you eat: White bread White rice Chips Cookies and pastries Boost fiber. Fiber makes stool easier to pass. It helps many people with IBS- C symptoms, but not everyone. Too little roughage in your diet can make it hard to have a bowel movement. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends 25 grams of fiber for women and 38 grams for men each day. People over age 50 may need a little less fiber (21 grams for women and 30 grams for men). You can get fiber in foods such as: Whole-grain bread and cereals Fruits Vegetables Beans Although meeting your daily fiber needs is best accomplished by eating the right foods, taking a fiber supplement can also help. Examples include psyllium, methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil. Don't shock your system with a sudden increase of fiber, though. Your body will need time to get used to it, so add a little each day. Too much at once may make you feel worse. Try increasing your intake by 2 grams to 3 grams per day. For example, if you normally eat 5 grams of fiber, try getting 8 grams on your first day and go from there. If it helps, stick with it until you're getting as much as experts recommend. Try prunes and liquids. \x1b[92m[0] Some fruity foods that are higher in the sugar sorbitol, such as prunes, dried plums (another name for prunes), and prune juice, can loosen bowels.\x1b[0m But again, too much can cause gas, bloating, cramping, and diarrhea. Some people find ground flaxseed helps ease their IBS- C symptoms. You can sprinkle it on salads, cooked vegetables, and cereals. Keeping yourself well-hydrated can help, too. Drink plenty of liquids like water and juice. But coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcohol can dehydrate you and make your IBS- C symptoms worse. Keep some carbs. Be mindful of low-carb diets. A high-protein and low-carb diet can cause constipation. You need protein, but don't cut out the carbs from fruits and vegetables. They'll help keep your digestive track working. Some simple changes may help you gain control of your IBS- C symptoms. Eat smaller meals more often. Some people with IBS- C find it helps to eat five or six smaller meals throughout the day, rather than three large ones. Don't skip breakfast. This meal, more than any other, can get your colon active. Dine at leisure. Too often we eat on the run or at our desks. But eating in a rush can trigger IBS- C symptoms. Try not to do other things while you're eating, such as drive or sit in front of the computer. The stress of multitasking may trigger symptoms, and if you eat quickly and swallow air, it can cause gas or bloating.

But what do you know about your triglycerides? \x1b[92m[0] If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other things that make you more likely to get heart disease, your doctor may want to keep a check on your triglyceride levels.\x1b[0m Like cholesterol, triglycerides are a type of fat, or lipid, in your blood. Too much triglyceride can raise your chance of heart disease or cause sudden pancreatitis. Just as you can have high cholesterol without knowing, you may not have any symptoms of high triglyceride levels. So your doctor will often check them regularly, especially if you: Smoke Are overweight or obese Don't exercise Have high blood pressure Had a heart attack or have heart disease Have diabetes or prediabetes, thyroid disease, or kidney disease A blood test called a lipid panel checks both your triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Usually, your doctor will ask that you fast, or not eat or drink anything other than water, for 9-12 hours before the test. You'll get blood drawn from a vein in your arm. Some labs offer non-fasting lipid panels, or they may prick your fingertip for blood. Your triglyceride levels are measured in one of two ways: milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) or millimoles per liter (mmol/ L). Normal: Less than 150 mg/d L, or less than 1.7 mmol/ L Borderline high: 150 to 199 mg/d L or 1.8 to 2.2 mmol/ L High: 200 to 499 mg/d L or 2.3 to 5.6 mmol/ L Very high: 500 mg/d L or above or 5.7 mmol/ L or above If you're a healthy adult, you should get a lipid profile every 4-6 years.

The St. John's wort plant has yellow flowers and is a weed in some parts of the U. S. It has been used for medicinal purposes in other parts of the world for thousands of years. Many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of St. John's wort. Some studies have shown a benefit, but other studies have not. \x1b[92m[9] If you choose to use it, be sure to learn all you can about it, and check with your doctor before taking it.\x1b[0m St. John's wort can interact with medicines or supplements you may be taking and may have side effects. There is some scientific evidence that St. John's wort may help treat mild depression, and the benefit seems similar to that of antidepressants. But two large studies, one sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM), showed that the herb wasn't more effective than a placebo in treating moderately severe major depression. The conventional drugs also studied didn't fare any better than a placebo, either. St. John's wort is most often taken in liquid or capsules. The dried herb may also be used as a tea. The most common dose used in studies has been 300 milligrams, three times a day as a standardized extract. Preparations in the U. S. have varied amounts in them. So be careful to note how much you're getting. You should be alert for any of the following effects: Allergic reactions Fatigue and restlessness Increased blood pressure Increased sensitivity to the sun, especially if you are fair-skinned and take large doses Upset stomach Don't combine St John's wort and prescription antidepressants such as SSRIs. That can cause a problem of too much serotonin, called serotonin syndrome. You may have to wait a period of time before you start St. John's wort even if you and your doctor decide to stop taking an antidepressant. ( Don't stop taking an antidepressant on your own.) Avoid foods or drinks that contain a chemical called tyramine. These items include aged cheeses, cured meats, sauerkraut, soy sauce, miso, tofu, beer, and wine. Some research shows that when St. John's wort mixes with tyramine, it can lead to serious problems including high blood pressure, fast heart rate, and becoming delirious. Herbal remedies aren't recommended for pregnant women, children, the elderly, or people with certain medical conditions or taking certain medicines. Research from National Institutes of Health shows that St. John's wort may reduce the effectiveness of several drugs, including birth control pills, drugs used to prevent organ transplant rejections, and some heart disease medications. Talk to your doctor about all the medications you take. If you have side effects such as nausea, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, insomnia, diarrhea, or skin rashes, stop taking St. John's wort and tell your doctor. Beware of commercial claims of what St. John's wort can do. Look for scientific-based sources of information.

However, these people should be told that the vaccination will not cure them of current HPV infections or treat the abnormal results of their Pap test (31). Although HPV vaccines have been found to be safe when given to people who are already infected with HPV, the vaccines provide maximum benefit if a person receives them before he or she is sexually active (32, 33). \x1b[92m[5] It is likely that someone previously infected with HPV will still get some residual benefit from vaccination, even if he or she has already been infected with one or more of the HPV types included in the vaccines.\x1b[0m Do women who have been vaccinated against HPV still need to be screened for cervical cancer?

The vaccine is up to 99% effective in preventing cervical, vaginal and vulvar abnormalities, which can develop into cancer if left untreated. The vaccine also protects against most genital warts and anal cancers. Women and people with a cervix who receive the vaccine are less likely to have abnormal Pap tests, cervical pre-cancer and genital warts. The vaccine works best on people who have not been exposed to HPV. \x1b[92m[2] If you are sexually active and may have been exposed to HPV, the vaccine can still be effective.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[8] The vaccine protects against several types of HPV, and it is likely you may not have been exposed to one of those types of the virus.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/human-papillomavirus-hpv-and-genital-warts\n\x1b[92m[13] Three vaccines are available that offer protection against certain strains of HPV, including those that have the highest risk of leading to cervical or anal cancer.\x1b[0m All three can offer protection against HPV strains 16 and 18, which cause 70% of cervical cancers and 80% of anal cancers worldwide.

Smoking, which is also linked with some of these cancers, may work with HPV to increase cancer risk. Other genital infections may also increase the risk that HPV will cause cancer. You can get more details in HPV and Cancer. Vaccines against HPV Vaccines are now available to help protect children and young adults against infection from the main cancer-causing HPV types. HPV vaccination can help prevent more than 90% of HPV cancers. These vaccines are approved for use in females and males and are given as a series of injections (shots). \x1b[92m[10] The vaccines can only be used to help prevent HPV infection – they do not stop or help treat an existing infection.\x1b[0m To be most effective, the vaccine series should be given before a person becomes sexually active (has sex with another person). American Cancer Society recommendations for HPV vaccination ', 'https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-vaccine-fact-sheet\nThe combination of HPV vaccination and cervical screening can provide the greatest protection against cervical cancer. Also, HPV vaccination reduces the risk of developing cancers caused by HPV at sites other than the cervix. \x1b[92m[11] Not only does vaccination protect vaccinated individuals against infection by the HPV types targeted by the vaccine that is used (and possibly other types, depending on the extent of cross protection), but vaccination can also reduce the prevalence of the vaccine-targeted HPV types in the population, thereby reducing infection in individuals who are not vaccinated (a phenomenon called herd protection, or herd immunity).\x1b[0m For example, in Australia, where a high proportion of girls are vaccinated with Gardasil, the incidence of genital warts went down during the first 4 years of the vaccination program among young males—who were not being vaccinated at the time—as well as among young females (21). ', ""https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/hpv-vaccine\nWhen the FDA approved the first human papillomavirus ( HPV) vaccine in 2006, it was big news. The new HPV vaccination made headlines at the time, which wasn't surprising, given that it was the very first vaccine approved to prevent cervical cancer. Yet, even though the HPV vaccine has been around for years, not everyone knows exactly what it is or what it does. You might be wondering: How does it work? Is it safe? Should you or your child get it? So you can be more confident when you talk to your doctor about the HPV vaccine, here are answers to these and other common questions about the vaccine. HPV stands for human papillomavirus. It's a virus that can be transmitted through sexual contact. During intercourse or oral sex, HPV can make its way into the genitals, mouth, or throat and cause infection. Sexually transmitted HPV comes in more than 40 different varieties. The type of the virus you get determines what effects it has on your body. Certain types of HPV cause genital warts. Other HPV types can make cells turn cancerous. You've probably heard that HPV causes cervical cancer, but it also causes less common cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, head, and neck. What's tricky about HPV is that it doesn't have symptoms. There's no sore throat or fever to let you know you've been infected. Most people clear the infection on their own. In fact, you might have absolutely no idea you've been infected until you develop genital warts or have an abnormal Pap test. Though HPV might not be as well known among sexually transmitted infections ( STIs) as herpes or syphilis, it is actually the most common STI. If you're sexually active, there's a very good chance of being infected with HPV at some point in your life. That's why immunization is so important. Three vaccines are available to protect against the types of HPV that cause most cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile and anal cancers. They are Gardasil, and Gardasil 9. They also protect against most genital warts. Whichever of these vaccines you and your doctor choose, you should stick with the same vaccine for all three shots. Whether you have to get vaccinated depends on your age and where you live. In certain states, girls and boys within the recommended ages may need to get the HPV vaccine in order to go to school. Getting vaccinated could help lead to the reduction of the prevalence of HPV infection. HPV is known to cause cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal cancer, as well as cancer of the back of the throat. Cervical cancer alone kills about 4,000 women each year in the U. S. One in four persons in the United States is infected with HPV and most of them are unaware. It spreads easily among infected partners. Gardasil prevents HPV-16 and HPV-18, which is responsible for 70% of all cervical cancers, as well as HPV- 6 and HPV-11, which are known to cause 90% of all genital warts. Gardasil 9 also protects against these four HPV strains, as well as five others. The best time to get the HPV vaccine is before you've started having sexual activity. That's why the CDC recommends that both boys and girls get their vaccination at age 11 or 12, although they can get the vaccine as early as age 9. \x1b[92m[1] If you're 13 or older and you haven't already been vaccinated, you can still get the vaccine through age 26.\x1b[0m Gardasil 9 can be given to both males and females until age 45. The Gardasil vaccine isn't recommended for people over age 26, because it hasn't been studied well enough in this age group. If enough future studies show that it is safe and effective for people over 26, the FDA may eventually start recommending it for this age group. The FDA has approved the use of Gardasil 9 for males and females up to age 45. You'll get three shots of the HPV vaccine over a 6-month period. You need to take all three doses to be completely protected. You'll get the second shot about 1 to 2 months after the first, and the third shot 6 months after the first. Once you've started with a vaccine brand ( Gardasil or Gardasil 9), stick with it for all three shots. No. If you have a current HPV, the vaccine won't get rid of the infection. \x1b[92m[6] However, if you have one type of HPV, the vaccine may prevent you from getting another type of the virus.\x1b[0m There's really no way to treat the virus once you have it, although there are treatments for diseases caused by HPV such as genital warts and genital cancers. This is why you should have regular pelvic exams and Pap tests (if you're female) to screen for cervical cancer. The vaccine appears to offer long-term protection from HPV. However, even women who have received the vaccine should see their gynecologist regularly for a Pap test to check for cervical cancer, because the vaccine doesn't protect against all HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. Most insurance plans cover routine vaccines, which means that if you're in the recommended age group, your insurance should pay for the vaccine. Check with your insurance company just to be sure. If your family doesn't have health insurance or you're on Medicaid, you should be able to get the HPV vaccine for free through the Vaccines for Children ( VFC) program. Vaccines have to be rigorously tested before they can be widely distributed. The HPV vaccines were tested on thousands of people and shown to be safe before they were released to the public. These vaccines have been used for years now, and experts say the chance of them causing a serious reaction is very slim. The HPV vaccine does not contain mercury or the preservative thimerosal. Some people shouldn't get the vaccine. You definitely don't want to get the HPV vaccine if you've had a serious allergic reaction to it or to any of its components. Let your doctor know if you have any severe allergies to anything, including baker's yeast or latex. Also, talk to your doctor if you have an immune system problem or blood disorder. If you're pregnant, you'll want to wait to get the HPV vaccine until after your baby is born. In studies, HPV vaccines have not been found to cause any problems in babies whose mothers got the vaccine while pregnant, but pregnant women should not get HPV vaccine, as safety studies are still ongoing. You could have side effects, but they should be mild. Most people who complain of symptoms after getting the HPV shot have minor issues like pain or swelling at the site of the shot, fever, headache, and nausea. Sometimes people faint after getting the HPV vaccine or any other vaccination. Sitting down after getting the shot can help prevent you from passing out. No. The part of the HPV virus used in both vaccines is inactivated (not live), so it can't cause actual HPV infection.""]",Can the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine help if you already have the virus?,"Yes, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine can still offer benefits even if you already have the virus [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m.

Limit yourself to one 5- to 10-minute bath or shower daily. If you bathe more than that, you may strip away much of the skin's oily layer and cause it to lose moisture.

If you don't want to give them up altogether, be sure to use a light touch. For the same reason, pat or blot (don't rub) the skin when toweling dry. Apply moisturizer immediately after bathing or washing your hands. This helps plug the spaces between your skin cells and seal in moisture while your skin is still damp.

If you start scratching and find a rash, it's likely the problem is in your skin. It can happen because of: Fungal and bacterial infections like impetigo and folliculitis. See a photo of what impetigo looks like. Bugs: When you get bitten by a mosquito or spider, you know it. Bites from bedbugs and mites can be harder to diagnose because they look like rashes. Lice can cause a crawling sensation in your scalp or pubic hair, along with an intense itch. See a photo of what bedbug bites look like. Eczema or atopic dermatitis: It shows up on your skin as dry, scaly patches or a bumpy rash. It isn't clear what causes it, but it's extremely itchy. Kids are more likely to get it if their family has a history of asthma and allergies. Certain food allergies can make it worse. So does scratching. See a photo of what eczema looks like. Contact dermatitis: This itchy rash is caused by a reaction to something touching your skin. You may have to do some detective work to figure out where it's coming from. It could be the metals in your jewelry or the chemicals in cosmetics, toiletries, and cleaning products. Poison ivy is also a form of contact dermatitis. Stop using or wearing whatever you think might be the cause and see if the itching gets better. See a photo of what a poisonous plant rash looks like. Is It Beneath the Surface? Your skin may let you know when something is not quite right inside your body. This itch can be a symptom of deeper problems. Hives: You get them from allergies. They look like raised welts that show up alone or in clusters, and they are usually itchy. Stress, heat, exercise, or exposure to the sun can also bring them out. See a photo of what hives look like. Psoriasis: It makes your body overproduce skin cells, which pile up in itchy, inflamed patches on the skin's surface. This is a result of an overactive immune system. See a photo of what psoriasis looks like. Pregnancy: More than 1 in 10 pregnant women say itching is a problem. The reasons range from harmless rashes to more serious conditions.

'You can also get a stomach bug by touching any surface that has been in contact with the stool, saliva or vomit of someone infected with the virus.' By contrast, the cause of food poisoning is consumption of food or water contaminated by bacteria, certain viruses, and less commonly, parasites. Diagnosis 'In the case of viral gastroenteritis,' Dr. Thomas says, 'we usually can make a diagnosis based on the presenting symptoms alone.' Also, although not readily available in all clinical settings, a rapid stool test is available for the detection of rotavirus and norovirus.

Viral gastroenteritis is also a self-limiting disease. In other words, you will likely recover on your own without treatment. With a stomach virus, your immune system is busy trying to help you feel normal. Those types of diseases might resolve spontaneously.

How common is viral gastroenteritis? Who is more likely to get viral gastroenteritis? What are the complications of viral gastroenteritis? What is viral gastroenteritis ('stomach flu')? \x1b[92m[0] Viral gastroenteritis is an infection of your intestines that typically causes watery diarrhea, pain or cramping in your abdomen, nausea or vomiting, and sometimes fever.\x1b[0m Viral gastroenteritis is caused by viruses. Viruses invade normal cells in your body. Many viruses cause infections that can be spread from person to person. \x1b[92m[3] People commonly call viral gastroenteritis 'stomach flu,' but the term is not medically correct.\x1b[0m Viral gastroenteritis is an infection of the intestines, not the stomach, and it is not caused by influenza (flu) viruses. The flu vaccine does not protect against viral gastroenteritis. "", 'https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/gastroenteritis\nGastroenteritis (also known as ‘gastro’) is a common and very contagious infection of the gut (the stomach and intestines). It causes inflammation of the lining of your digestive system. Gastro usually causes a mild illness that involves vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pains and nausea. Older people, young children and those with a weakened immune system are at a higher risk of developing more severe symptoms. What causes gastroenteritis? \x1b[92m[9] Gastro may be caused by: viruses are the most common cause, including rotavirus and norovirus bacteria, such as salmonella, campylobacter toxins produced by bacteria such as clostridium difficile parasites, such as giardia and cryptosporidium Viruses that cause gastro are very contagious.\x1b[0m They are found in human faeces (poo). Viral gastro spreads when you have contact with infected vomit or faeces. Viral gastro can spread through: contaminated food, drinks or objects ', ""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/viral-gastroenteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378847\nNoroviruses. Both children and adults are affected by noroviruses, the most common cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Norovirus infection can sweep through families and communities. \x1b[92m[12] It's especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces.In most cases, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[11] But it can also spread between people who are in close contact or who share food.\x1b[0m You can also get the virus by touching a surface that's been contaminated with norovirus and then touching your mouth. "", 'https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/norovirus\n\x1b[92m[13] In addition to handwashing, people traveling together can use measures to prevent transmission of noroviruses, including carefully cleaning up fecal material or vomit and disinfecting contaminated surfaces and toilet areas.\x1b[0m Travelers should use products approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency for norovirus disinfection; alternatively, they can use a dilute bleach solution (5–25 tablespoons bleach per gallon of water). Travelers should wash soiled articles of clothing for the maximum available cycle length and machine dry clothing on high heat. To help prevent the spread of noroviruses, consider isolation for ill people on cruise ships and in institutional settings, including hospitals, long-term care facilities, and schools.

Antidiarrheals and antiemetics are not recommended for the routine management of acute gastroenteritis in children. For adults, antiemetic, antimotility, and antisecretory agents can be useful adjuncts to rehydration. Antibiotics are not useful in treating patients with norovirus disease. Prevention No norovirus vaccine is currently available, but vaccine development is advancing. \x1b[92m[10] Noroviruses are common and highly contagious, but travelers can minimize their risk for infection by frequently and properly washing hands and avoiding possibly contaminated food and water.\x1b[0m Washing hands with soap and water for ≥20 seconds is considered the most effective way to reduce norovirus contamination; alcohol-based hand sanitizers might be useful between handwashings, but should not be considered a substitute for soap and water. ', 'https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/diarrhea-stomach-flu\nEvery year, millions of Americans come down with the ""stomach flu,"" or viral gastroenteritis. \x1b[92m[1] It can cause diarrhea, vomiting, cramps, fever, and headache.\x1b[0m It\'s also highly contagious. What treatments will make life with the stomach flu a little less awful? More importantly, how can you avoid getting it in the first place? Here are some answers. The stomach flu is not a single disease. Instead, it\'s just a nickname for viral gastroenteritis, which is itself caused by a number of nasty viruses, such as noroviruses, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses. These viruses target the digestive tract and cause inflammation of the stomach and intestines. The most awful symptoms -- diarrhea, vomiting, and cramps -- are actually your body\'s defense mechanisms. Your body is trying to drive the virus out. Stomach flu can develop at any time of the year, but it\'s most common in the fall and winter in the U. S. Although unpleasant, stomach flu is rarely serious. Symptoms usually last for 1 to 3 days and sometimes longer. The greatest risk -- especially in babies and older people -- comes from dehydration. Untreated, dehydration can be dangerous. Despite the name, stomach flu has nothing to do with the ""true"" flu, influenza. Influenza causes body ache and fever. It almost never causes diarrhea or vomiting in adults. Rarely, it can trigger vomiting in children. There is no cure for the stomach flu. Antibiotics don\'t help, because it\'s caused by viruses, not bacteria. For the most part, you just have to wait it out. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to make yourself more comfortable and prevent complications. Drink more. It\'s important to increase fluid intake when you are vomiting or have diarrhea. Adults should aim to get one cup of fluid every hour. Children need 1 ounce of fluid every 30 to 60 minutes. Drink slowly, since too much at once could worsen vomiting. If your child tends to gulp, give her a frozen popsicle instead. Drink wisely. When you have diarrhea, drinking more water may not be enough. You\'re losing important minerals and electrolytes that water can\'t supply. Instead, ask your doctor about giving your sick child an oral rehydration solution such as Cera Lyte, Infalyte, Naturalyte, Pedialyte, and generic brands. ( If your baby is still nursing or using formula, keep feeding him as usual.) Adults can use oral rehydration solutions or diluted juices, diluted sports drinks, clear broth, or decaffeinated tea. Sugary, carbonated, caffeinated, or alcoholic drinks can make diarrhea worse, so be sure to dilute sugary beverages if you drink them. Don\'t eat only bland foods. The old advice was to stick with a liquid diet for a few days and then to add in bland foods, such as the BRAT diet of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. That\'s fine for the first day or so of stomach flu. However, doctors say that you should return to your normal diet as soon as you feel up to it. BRAT foods aren\'t bad. They just don\'t provide the fat and protein that you need. Sticking with them too long could actually slow your recovery. Get the right nutrients. Look for foods with potassium (such as potatoes, bananas, and fruit juices), salt (such as pretzels and soup), and yogurt with active bacterial cultures. Even a little fat could help, because it slows down digestion and may reduce diarrhea. If you feel up to it, add a pat of butter or some lean meat to your next meal. Use over-the-counter medications. They\'re not necessary, but some people find relief in medications for diarrhea and vomiting. Just use them with care, and read and follow the label instructions. Never give a medication for diarrhea or vomiting to a child unless a pediatrician says that you should. Rest. Give your body time to recover. The viruses that cause gastroenteritis come from contact with an infected person\'s stool. You may get it if a person with the virus didn\'t wash his hands after using the bathroom and then touched the escalator at the mall -- the same escalator you touched before eating lunch. Stomach flu viruses are tough, too. Some can live on surfaces such as counters for months. It\'s important to take steps to protect yourself and your family. Here\'s some advice. Wash your hands. According to experts, this is still the best way to stop a stomach virus. One review of studies found that good hand-washing technique cut the rate of diarrhea by 40%. \x1b[92m[14] Make sure to use soap and water and do it thoroughly -- wash your hands for as long as it takes to recite the alphabet.\x1b[0m Always wash your hands after using the bathroom, before eating, and after changing a diaper. Use hand sanitizer. If you\'re not near a sink to wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Be aware that hand sanitizer may not be as effective as hand washing at preventing the stomach flu. Wipe down surfaces. If a family member has the stomach flu, wash off high-traffic areas -- such as the bathroom, door knobs, phones, and TV remotes -- with a diluted bleach solution. If it\'s possible, keep healthy people out of the bathroom the sick person is using. Make sure your kids get their vaccines. Vaccines for rotavirus can protect children from some types of stomach flu. Kids usually get the vaccines before they are age 2. Most people don\'t need to see the doctor when they have the stomach flu. \x1b[92m[6] But it\'s a good idea to get medical attention if you or your child has stomach flu and: Is under 3 months old Is over 3 months old and has been vomiting for more than 12 hours or the diarrhea hasn\'t gotten better after two days Is an adult and the diarrhea hasn\'t gotten a little better after two days Has other symptoms, such as high fever or blood or pus in the stool In rare cases, people with stomach flu need to be hospitalized, usually because of dehydration.\x1b[0m In adults, dehydration can cause extreme thirst, decreased urination, dark urine, dry skin, fatigue, and dizziness. In babies and young children, dehydration can cause: Crying without tears Going three hours or more without a wet diaper Fever Dry tongue and mouth Extreme crankiness Sunken fontanel, the soft spot on the top of a baby\'s head Sunken cheeks or eyes Anyone with signs of dehydration needs medical help right away.']",What should you know about the stomach flu?,"The stomach flu, medically known as viral gastroenteritis, is an intestinal infection marked by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea or vomiting, and sometimes fever [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m.

That\'s because these are common, severe illnesses and leading causes of disability. Depression and bipolar disorder can be emotionally crippling, making it difficult to live life to its fullest. Persistent Depressive Disorder, a newer diagnosis that consolidates chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder, is a condition where a person is depressed for at least 2 years. Persistent Depressive Disorder is a less severe form of depression. Although less extreme, Persistent Depressive Disorder ( PDD) causes chronic or long-lasting moodiness that ranges in severity. It is marked by a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years. In children and teens, moods can be irritable for at least 1 year to be called Persistent Depressive Disorder. PDD can occur alone or with other psychiatric or mood disorders, although not with mania or hypomania. As with depression, PDD is more common in women than in men. A family history of mood disorders is not uncommon. This mood disorder tends to appear earlier than major depression, although it can begin anytime from childhood to later in life. Up to 4% of the general population is affected by PDD. Its cause is not well understood. A combination of factors likely conspires to create this mood disorder. These factors may include: Genetics Abnormalities in the functioning of brain circuits involve in emotional processing Chronic stress or medical illness Isolation Poor coping strategies and problems adjusting to life stresses These factors can feed off each other. For example, if you always see ""the glass as half empty,"" you may reinforce the symptoms of depression. And a chronic mood disorder can sensitize you to stress, further feeding your risk for depression. In addition to chronic low moods, common symptoms of this mood disorder include: Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness Trouble sleeping or daytime sleepiness Poor appetite or eating too much Poor concentration Fatigue or low energy Low self-esteem Trouble concentrating or making decisions A diagnosis of PDD in adults requires at least a two-year history of depressed mood for most of the day on most days, along with at least two of the symptoms noted above. Although some symptoms may overlap, you may be less likely to have weight or sleep changes with PDD than with depression. You may also tend to withdraw more and have stronger feelings of pessimism and inadequacy than with major depression. Staying in a constant state of moodiness is no way to live. That\'s one reason to seek treatment. Another is that PDD can also increase your risk for physical diseases. Yet another reason to pursue treatment? If left untreated, this mood disorder can develop into more severe depression. It can also increase your risk for attempting suicide. Antidepressants , such as selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants, are often used to treat PDD. Because you may need to continue treatment for a lengthy period, it\'s important to consider which medications not only work well but also ideally have few side effects. You may need to try more than one medication to find the one that works best. But know that it may take several weeks or longer to take effect. Successful treatment for chronic depression often takes longer than for acute (non-chronic) depression. Take your medications as your doctor instructs. If they\'re causing side effects or still not working after several weeks, discuss this with your doctor. Don\'t suddenly stop taking your medications. \x1b[92m[0] Doctors believe treatment for PDD is effective with a combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy.\x1b[0m Specific kinds of talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or interpersonal therapy ( IPT), are known to be effective forms of psychotherapy that treat PDD. A structured treatment lasting for a certain period of time, CBT involves recognizing and restructuring thoughts. It can help you change your distorted thinking. IPT is also a time-limited, structured treatment. Its focus is on addressing current problems and solving interpersonal conflicts. Psychodynamic psychotherapy involves exploring unhealthy or unsatisfying patterns of behavior and motivations that you may not be consciously aware of which could lead to feelings of depression and negative expectations and life experiences. Some studies also suggest that aerobic exercise can help with mood disorders. This is most effective when done four to six times a week. But some exercise is better than none at all. Other changes may also help, including seeking social support and finding an interesting occupation. Used for patients with major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern (formerly known as seasonal affective disorder), bright-light therapy may also help some people with PDD. Bipolar disorder causes severe, unusual shifts in mood and energy that affect your ability to do normal tasks at home, school, or work. Cyclothymic disorder is often thought of as a mild form of bipolar disorder. With cyclothymic disorder, you have low-grade high periods (hypomanias) as well as brief, fleeting periods of depression that don\'t last as long (less than 2 weeks at a time) as in a major depressive episode. The hypomanias in cyclothymic disorder are similar to those seen in bipolar II disorder, and do not progress to full-blown manias. For example, you may feel an exaggerated sense of productivity or power, but you don\'t lose connection with reality. In fact, some people feel the ""highs"" of cyclothymic disorder are even enjoyable. They tend to not be as disabling as they are with bipolar disorder. Up to 1% of the U. S. population -- equal numbers of men and women -- has cyclothymia. Its cause is unknown, but genetics may play a role; cyclothymia is more common in people with relatives who have bipolar disorder. Symptoms usually appear in adolescence or young adulthood. But because symptoms are mild, it is often difficult to tell when cyclothymia begins. A diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder may result from simply describing symptoms like these: Episodes that involve brief, recurrent periods of depression and, at other times, episodes of hypomania; this pattern of episodes must be present for at least 2 years. Symptoms that persist, creating fewer than 2 symptom-free months in a row. The episodes of cyclothymic disorder are often somewhat unpredictable. Either depression or hypomania can last for days or weeks, interspersed with a month or two of normal moods. Or, you may have no ""normal"" periods in between. In some cases, cyclothymic disorder progresses to full-blown bipolar disease. Some people with mild symptoms of cyclothymia are able to live successful, fulfilling lives. Others find their relationships troubled by depression, impulsive actions, and strong emotions. For these people, short-term medications may bring relief. However, cyclothymic disorder may not respond as well to medications as does bipolar disorder. A combination of mood stabilizers and psychotherapy is most effective. Mood stabilizers include antiseizure drugs such as lithium, Depakote, Tegretol, or Lamictal.']",How do you treat persistent depressive disorder?,"Persistent depressive disorder, a chronic form of depression, requires a comprehensive treatment plan often combining psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), with medication, such as antidepressants [92m[0][0m.

Always read food labels to make sure they don't contain an ingredient you're allergic to. Even if you think you know what's in a food, check the label. Ingredients sometimes change. Food labels are required to clearly list whether the food products contain any common food allergens. \x1b[92m[2] Read food labels carefully to avoid the most common sources of food allergens: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy and wheat.\x1b[0m When in doubt, say no thanks. At restaurants and social gatherings, you're always taking a risk that you might eat a food you're allergic to. Many people don't understand the seriousness of an allergic food reaction and may not realize that a tiny amount of a food can cause a severe reaction in some people. If you have any suspicion at all that a food may contain something you're allergic to, don't eat it. "", 'https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/foodallergies/index.htm\nThere is no cure for food allergies. Strict avoidance of the food allergen is the only way to prevent a reaction. \x1b[92m[1] However, because it is not always easy or possible to avoid certain foods, staff in schools, out-of-school time, and early care and education programs (ECE) should develop plans for preventing an allergic reaction and responding to a food allergy emergency, including anaphylaxis.\x1b[0m Early and quick recognition and treatment can prevent serious health problems or death. Eight foods or food groups account for most serious allergic reactions in the United States: milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts.2 ', 'https://www.thermofisher.com/allergy/us/en/living-with-allergies/food-allergies/living-with-food-allergy-anxiety.html\nPurchase the same tests your doctor orders and get insights into your health.

A mild reaction involves a mild symptom that affects only one area of the body. A reaction that involves any severe symptom is a severe reaction. A reaction that involves mild symptoms in more than one body area is also a severe reaction. Severe reactions can quickly progress to anaphylaxis, a condition that can be life-threatening. For this reason, severe reactions must be treated with epinephrine. Giving Epinephrine Epinephrine is the only medication that can reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis. It is available in an easy-to-use auto-injector (Auvi-Q ®, EpiPen®, Generic Epinephrine Auto-Injector [Authorized Generic of EpiPen®] or Adrenaclick®). Your allergist may prefer that epinephrine be used with only mild symptoms, or before symptoms even emerge. \x1b[92m[6] Consult with your doctor and refer to your personalized Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Emergency Care Plan.\x1b[0m ', ""https://www.webmd.com/allergies/foods-allergy-intolerance\nIt's pretty common to have a reaction to a certain food, but in most cases it's an intolerance rather than a true allergy. Why does it matter? Although they may have similar symptoms, a food allergy can be more serious. These clues can help you figure out if it is an allergy or intolerance. A doctor can help you know for sure. Food Allergy: Usually comes on suddenly Small amount of food can trigger Happens every time you eat the food Can be life-threatening Food Intolerance: Usually comes on gradually May only happen when you eat a lot of the food May only happen if you eat the food often Is not life-threatening A food allergy and an intolerance both can cause: Nausea Stomach pain Diarrhea Vomiting When a food irritates your stomach or your body can't properly digest it, that's an intolerance. You may have these symptoms: Gas, cramps, or bloating Heartburn Headaches Irritability or nervousness A food allergy happens when your immune system mistakes something in food as harmful and attacks it. It can affect your whole body, not just your stomach. Symptoms may include: Rash, hives, or itchy skin Shortness of breath Chest pain Sudden drop in blood pressure, trouble swallowing or breathing -- this is life-threatening. Call 911 immediately. These triggers cause about 90% of food allergies: Peanuts Tree nuts (such as walnuts, pecans and almonds) Fish Shellfish Milk Eggs Soy Wheat The most common food intolerance is lactose intolerance. It happens when people can't digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy. Another kind of intolerance is being sensitive to sulfites or other food additives. Sulfites can trigger asthma attacks in some people. What about a gluten allergy? While celiac disease -- a long-lasting digestive condition that's triggered by eating gluten -- does involve the immune system, it doesn't cause life-threatening symptoms. Your doctor can find out if you have an allergy or intolerance. These things may help: Keep a diary of the foods you eat and the symptoms you have. Stop eating some foods to help figure out which one is causing symptoms. Have allergy tests done. If you have a food allergy, you'll need to stop eating the food altogether. \x1b[92m[4] If you have a food intolerance, you'll need to avoid or cut back on that food in your diet.\x1b[0m For lactose intolerance, you can look for lactose-free milk or take a lactase enzyme supplement. With a food allergy, you could be at risk for anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction. Ask your doctor if you need to carry epinephrine shots ( Adreniclick, Auvi- Q, Epi Pen, a generic, or Symjepi) which you could give yourself in an emergency. If so, always carry two injections with you. Learn which foods -- and how much -- cause you to have symptoms. \x1b[92m[3] Either avoid the food or only have as much as you can without triggering symptoms.\x1b[0m When you eat out, ask your server about how your meal will be prepared. It may not always be clear from the menu whether some dishes contain problem foods. Learn to read food labels and check the ingredients for trigger foods.

That's because the disorder has a number of possible symptoms, and they can easily be confused with those of other conditions, like depression or anxiety. Not sure whether you should get checked by a doc? If many of these apply, you may need to get checked out. 1. People say you're forgetful. Everyone misplaces car keys or jackets once in a while. But this kind of thing happens often when you have ADHD. You might spend time looking for glasses, wallets, phones, and other items every day. You may also forget to return phone calls, space out on paying bills, or miss medical appointments. 2. People complain that you don't listen. Most of us lose focus on a conversation once in a while, especially if there's a TV nearby or something else grabs our attention. This happens often and to a greater degree with ADHD, even when there are no distractions around. But still, ADHD is more than that. 3. You're often late. Time management is an ongoing challenge when you have ADHD. It often leads to missed deadlines or appointments unless you work on avoiding that. 4. You have trouble concentrating. Problems with attention, especially focusing for long periods of time or paying attention to details, is one of the hallmarks of the condition. Depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders can also take a toll on your focus, and many people with ADHD have one or more of these issues, too. Your doctor can ask you questions to get to the bottom of what's causing your attention problems. 5. You leave things undone. Problems with attention and memory can make it tough to start or finish projects, especially ones that you know will take a lot of focus to complete. This symptom can point to depression, too. 6. You had behavior issues as a child. \x1b[92m[4] You need to have had attention and concentration problems as a child in order to be diagnosed with ADHD as an adult -- even if those early symptoms didn't come with a formal diagnosis.\x1b[0m People may have accused you of being lazy back in childhood. Or they may have thought you had another condition like depression or anxiety. If you actually were diagnosed with the disorder as a child, you may still have it. The symptoms change as you age, and not everyone outgrows it. 7. You lack impulse control. This is more than tossing a candy bar into your cart at the checkout line. This is doing something even though you know it could have serious consequences, like running a red light because you think you can get away with it or not being able to keep quiet when you have something to say, even though you know you should. 8. You can't get organized. You may notice this more at work. You could have trouble setting priorities, following through on tasks, and meeting project deadlines. 9. You're fidgety. Kids with ADHD are often hyperactive, but adults are more likely to be fidgety or restless. You might also talk too much and interrupt others. 10. You can't control your emotions. You might be moody or irritable, express frustration often, feel unmotivated, or be prone to angry outbursts. ADHD can make it hard to manage uncomfortable emotions or follow appropriate behavior when you're upset. There's no one test. Instead, doctors and psychologists get information about what and how many symptoms you have, when they started, how long they've lasted, and how severe they are. In order to be diagnosed with ADHD, you need to have several symptoms, not just one or two. And they have to have affected your jobs, relationships, or other important areas of your life. Your doctor will also want to rule out other conditions or find out if you have more than one disorder. Several treatments can help you manage the condition. So if you answered yes to a lot of these questions, consider making an appointment with your doctor. The sooner you find out, the sooner you can start treatment.""]",How do you know if you have ADHD?,"To determine if you have ADHD, it's essential to seek a professional diagnosis [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m.

Instead, there are fairly simple behavioral therapies that can be very effective in controlling symptoms, especially when mild. These often include diet changes such as avoiding foods or beverages which irritate the bladder. \x1b[92m[0] Second, many patients find that urinating on a set schedule, with gradually increased intervals, can help to control urinary frequency and urgency (this is often called bladder training).\x1b[0m Finally, pelvic floor exercises (often called Kegel exercises) can be helpful both for preventing incontinence as well as reducing strong urges to urinate.Behavioral therapies for OAB are considered 'first-line' therapies, meaning they should typically be the first thing that someone tries to treat the syndrome of Overactive Bladder. Behavioral therapies have essentially no risks and are generally safe for anyone to try. You can try them on your own before you see a health provider. But behavioral therapies are also effective. There are numerous studies that suggest that behavioral changes, when put into place by motivated patients, could be as effective as other treatments for OAB, including medications. There is even more evidence that suggests that behavioral therapies, when combined with other therapies, makes those treatments even more effective. With my own patients, even those who have undergone surgical treatments such as sacral neuromodulation, I almost always circle back and reinforce those basic behavioral therapies. "", 'https://ugatl.com/services/overactive-bladder/bladder-training/\nBefore you begin a bladder training program, you will need to keep a diary of when you go to the bathroom. You should also include when you have the urge and when you leak. This diary will then be used along with the techniques below to help gain more control of your bladder.Schedule bathroom visits (Also known as avoiding schedule). Using your diary, note how often you are going to the bathroom. Then increase the time by about 15 minutes. Let’s take as an example that you are going to the bathroom every hour; you need to then schedule bathroom visits at every one hour and 15 minutes.It would be best if you then used the bathroom at that scheduled time period, whether you feel the urge to go or not. Then as time goes on, you should gradually increase the amount of time between bathroom breaks.Delayed urination. This technique helps you to deal with the urge to urinate. When you feel the urge to go, hold it for another five minutes or so. You can then gradually increase the amount of time by 10 minutes until the time between visits to the bathroom is as long as 3 – 4 hours. Y0u may need to distract your mind by counting backward from 100 or try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing.If you really cannot hold it any longer, then use the bathroom but try to return to your voiding schedule. This technique is very effective in treating urge incontinence.Kegel exercises. \x1b[92m[2] Kegel exercises (or pelvic muscle exercises) strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, the ones you use to start and stop the flow of urine.\x1b[0m Pelvic floor exercises combined with other bladder retraining techniques are particularly effective in treating incontinence in women. The exercise involves squeezing the muscles that are used to stop the flow of urine. Hold it for 5 seconds and then relax for 5 seconds. Try to increase the length of time until you reach 10 seconds of squeezing and 10 seconds of relaxing in between. You can do these while you’re sitting or laying down. Try to reach three sets of 10 contractions a day.You can also try the following tips to regain control of your bladder:Limit beverages that increase urination. \x1b[92m[4] This may include caffeinated drinks like sodas, coffee, and tea.Drink less fluid before you go to bed.Go to the bathroom as soon as you get up in the morning and before you go to bed at night.Keeping your diary up to date will help you and your doctor track your progress and determine how to adjust your program.Call or book an appointment online with Urology of Greater Atlanta to learn more about overactive bladder and the many treatments available.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.womenandinfants.org/blog/what-is-overactive-bladder\n\x1b[92m[1] Pelvic floor muscle exercises and physical therapy can strengthen your pelvic floor muscles (Kegel exercises) to help you control your bladder.\x1b[0m Your provider can check that you are doing your Kegel squeeze correctly. If your pelvic floor muscles are too weak or you have trouble doing Kegel exercises on your own, seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist may be helpful.

Aim for two to three sets a day. 08 of 11 Consider Biofeedback "", ""https://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/oab-treatments\nIf you have an overactive bladder ( OAB), it may feel like your condition controls your life. But it doesn't have to. There are many ways to treat it. These include simple changes in behavior and lifestyle, medications, and alternative treatments. Simple changes to your daily routine can help you manage OAB symptoms: Kegel exercises. Over time, these help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. They also build up the muscle that controls the flow of urine from your body. When it works like it should, it helps you to hold your pee until you can get to the bathroom. When it doesn't, you have leaks. To do Kegels, pretend you're going to pee, then squeeze the muscles you'd use to stop it. You'll have to do them a few times a day for 6 to 8 weeks before you see a change in your OAB symptoms. Train your bladder. This works a lot like Kegels. Hold your pee when you feel like you need to go. It's easier if you do it while sitting down. Sit still, and squeeze your pelvic floor muscles several times in a row. When the urge to pee passes, walk slowly to the bathroom. Be patient. It may take up to 8 weeks to see results. Watch what you eat and drink. Ask your doctor if you should limit how much you drink at certain times of the day. He might also tell you to avoid coffee, tea, alcohol, sodas, and juices. Ditto for fruits like oranges and grapefruit, and spicy foods. All of them can make your OAB symptoms worse. Keep your weight down. Exercise and weight loss can improve urinary incontinence and OAB symptoms. It'll ease the stress on your bladder and lead to fewer accidents. Double void. This means you pee, wait a few minutes, and then go again. It'll help make sure your bladder's empty. That way, you can avoid a quick trip back to the bathroom. Set a schedule If you can, try to space out your bathroom visits. Aim for every 2 to 4 hours. This way, you train yourself to pee at the same times every day. Stop smoking. Cigarette smoke irritates your bladder. It can also cause a hacking cough, which could trigger leaks. Talk to your doctor about OAB. He can prescribe a drug that'll help you regain your quality of life. Medications for OAB relax the bladder muscle, increase urine storage and control bladder muscle spasms.by blocking nerve signals in your brain. Doctors prescribe them to both men and women. They include: Darifenacin ( Enablex) Fesoterodine ( Toviaz) Mirabegron ( Myrbetriq). Oxybutynin ( Ditropan, Ditropan XL) Oxybutynin gel or patch ( Gelnique, Oxytrol), which you rub or place on your skin Solifenacin ( VESIcare) Tolterodine ( Detrol, Detrol LA) Trospium ( Sanctura, Sanctura XR) Women who've been through menopause can also use a form of the hormone estrogen that you apply inside your vagina. Doctors also treat men with drugs that relax a muscle at the bladder neck and prostate to help with emptying. They include: Alfuzosin ( Uroxatral) Doxazosin ( Cardura, Cardura XL) Silodosin ( Rapaflo) Tamsulosin ( Flomax) Botox injections: Onabotulinumtoxin A ( Botox) blocks nerve activity in the muscles of your bladder so it relaxes. That helps it hold urine and ease OAB. You'll get the shots in your doctor's office. About 6% of patients who receive botox may temporarily be unable to pee. You must be able and willing to catheterize if you cannot pee after botox. Your doctor may suggest them if other methods don't help. You'll get them in his office or a clinic. Sacral nerve stimulation: The doctor uses electricity to stimulate the nerves that control your bladder. He'll place a small device under the skin in your butt. It sends mild electric charges through a wire to a nerve in your lower back. This helps build bladder control. This procedure is commonly referred to as a bladder pacemaker. The main limitation with this treatment is the inability to obtain a spinal MRI. Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation: The doctor places a needle on nerves near your ankle that affect bladder control. You'll have one session a week for 12 weeks, then maintenance treatments as needed. This procedure is done in the office.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a complete eye exam at least every two years after age 65.

By the time she\'s 3, it will be easier for the doctor to assess her eyes. After the first grade, she should get eye tests every 1 to 2 years. If you have a health condition like high blood pressure, work in a job that requires you to use your eyes a lot, or take drugs that can affect eyesight, you may need more frequent exams. If you have type 1 diabetes, get your eyes checked within 5 years of your diagnosis and every year after that. You\'ll need an exam ASAP if you\'re diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Have your eyes checked every year after that. When you call to make an appointment for your exam, mention any vision problem you\'re having. Before you go, list any questions you want to ask the doctor. Also be ready to update him or her on any medicines you take and your (and your family\'s) eye health history. Bring your glasses and contact lenses along with the prescription with you. Also bring sunglasses for the trip home. The doctor might use eye drops to open up your pupils. This is called dilation. Your eyes will be sensitive to light afterward. First, the eye doctor or an office staff member will ask you about your medical and vision history. The exam may last from half an hour to several hours, depending on the equipment used. It will cover your vision and your eye health. You\'ll probably have all or most of the following eye tests, and possibly some other ones, too: Eye muscle movement test: This checks your eyes\' alignment. The doctor will watch your eyes move while you follow a target (like a finger tip or his pen) as it moves in different directions. Cover test: This tells how well your eyes work together. You\'ll stare at a small target some distance away. The doctor will cover and uncover each eye to observe how much your eyes move. Your doctor will also be watching for an eye that turns away from the target. This is a condition called strabismus. You may take the test again with a target close to you. External exam and pupil reactions: The doctor will watch how your pupils adjust to light and objects close to you. At the same time, the whites of your eyes and the position of your eyelids will also be checked. Visual acuity test: You\'ll sit in front of an eye chart, with letters that get smaller as you read down each line. You\'ll cover each eye in turn and, using the other eye, read aloud, going down the chart, until you can\'t read the letters anymore. Refraction testing: For your exact lens prescription, the doctor can use a computerized refractor. Your doctor may fine-tune the prescription by flipping the phoropter back and forth between lenses and asking you which is better. If you don\'t need corrective lenses, you won\'t have this test. Slit lamp (biomicroscope): This device magnifies and lights up the front of your eye. The doctor uses it to check your cornea, iris, lens, and the back of your eye, looking for signs of certain eye conditions. Retinal examination ( ophthalmoscopy ): Your doctor may dilate your pupils and use a tool called an ophthalmoscope and to see the back of your eyes -- the retina, retinal blood vessels, fluid in your eyes (he may call this vitreous fluid), and the head of your optic nerve. Glaucoma testing: This procedure checks to see if the fluid pressure inside your eyes is within a normal range. It\'s fast, painless, and can be done in a couple of ways: Tonometer: This is the most accurate. You\'ll get drops to numb your eyes. The doctor will tell you to stare straight ahead and will barely touch the front surface of each eye with a tool called an applanation tonometer or Tonopen to measure the pressure. Puff of air or noncontact tonometer: You\'ll stare at a target, and a machine will let out a small puff of air into each eye. How much your eye resists the puff indicates the pressure inside it. Pachymetry: This test uses ultrasound to measure the thickness of your cornea. Thin corneas can lead to false low-pressure readings. Thick corneas can lead to false high-pressure readings. You\'ll get this test just once to create a baseline for comparison with future readings. It can be used for people who need corneal surgery. Pupil dilation (enlargement): With your pupils fully enlarged, the doctor will use tools and lights to check the insides of your eyes. The eye drops for this part of the exam take about 20-30 minutes to work. They make your eyes more sensitive to light and blur your vision. These effects may last for several hours or longer. This is why you might need those sunglasses on your way home. Newer machine can look in the far back of your retina without your pupils being dilated. Visual field test (perimetry): Your visual field is the area you can see in front of you without moving your eyes. Using one of three tests, the eye doctor maps what you see at the edges (periphery) of your visual field and will use this map to diagnose eye conditions. Ask family or friends who they use. Ask your family doctor for a referral. Call the ophthalmology or optometry department of a nearby hospital and ask about doctors who practice there. Contact state and county academies, associations, or societies of optometrists and ophthalmologists, and ask if they can help you. Get a list from your health plan or health insurance company.']",How often should I get my eyes checked?,"It's generally recommended to have your eyes checked every one to two years [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m.

Thinning the uterine lining can reduce prostaglandin and bring pain relief. In some cases, these birth control methods can even stop periods and cramps, altogether.

They can range from mild to severe. They usually happen for the first time a year or two after a girl first gets her period. With age, they usually become less painful and may stop entirely after you have your first baby. Your doctor may call your cramps â  dysmenorrhea.â   Chances are, you know all too well how it feels. You may have: Aching pain in your belly (sometimes severe) Feeling of pressure in your belly Pain in the hips, lower back, and inner thighs When cramps are severe, symptoms may include: Upset stomach, sometimes with vomiting Loose stools Menstrual cramps happen because of contractions in the uterus, or womb, which is a muscle. If it contracts too strongly during your menstrual cycle, it can press against nearby blood vessels. This briefly cuts off the supply of oxygen to the uterus. It's this lack of oxygen causes your pain and cramping. If you have mild menstrual cramps, take aspirin or another pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. For best relief, you must take these medications as soon as bleeding or cramping starts. Heat can also help. Place a heating pad or hot water bottle on your lower back or tummy. Taking a warm bath may also provide some relief. You should also: Rest when needed. Avoid foods that contain caffeine and salt. Not use tobacco or drink alcohol Massage your lower back and abdomen. Women who exercise regularly often have less menstrual pain. To help prevent cramps, make exercise a part of your weekly routine. If these steps do not relieve pain, tell your doctor, in case you need medicines such as: Ibuprofen (higher dose than is available over the counter) or other prescription pain relievers Oral contraceptives ( Women taking birth control pills have less menstrual pain.) Primary dysmenorrhea means that your cramps are due to your cycle. Secondary dysmenorrhea is the term your doctor may use if you have a problem in your reproductive organs that causes your cramps. Several conditions can cause it: Endometriosis is a condition in which the tissue lining the uterus (the endometrium) is found outside of the uterus. Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID) is an infection caused by bacteria that starts in the uterus and can spread to other reproductive organs. Stenosis (narrowing) of the cervix , which is the lower part of the uterus, can be caused by scarring, as well as a lack of estrogen after menopause. The inner wall of the uterus may have fibroids (growths). \x1b[92m[1] If you have severe or unusual menstrual cramps, or cramping that lasts for more than 2 or 3 days, tell your doctor.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[4] Menstrual cramps, whatever the cause, can be treated, so it's important to get checked.\x1b[0m Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and menstrual cycles. You'll get a pelvic exam, in which your doctor will use a tool called a speculum to see into your vagina and cervix. She may take a small sample of vaginal fluid for testing, and use her fingers to check your uterus and ovaries for anything that doesn't feel normal. \x1b[92m[5] If it turns out that your cramps aren't due to your period, you might need other tests to find the right treatment.\x1b[0m""]",When should you call your doctor about menstrual cramps?,"You should call your doctor about menstrual cramps if they're severe and not relieved by over-the-counter medications, disrupt your daily activities, or if you experience symptoms like heavy bleeding, fever, sudden severe pain, or if the cramps occur at times other than your period [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m.

Wash your hands. Do it often, and use soap and water. Wash them before you eat and before you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Always clean up after you go to the bathroom, sneeze, cough, or blow your nose. \x1b[92m[2] Other times to wash: after you handle trash, go to a public place, or touch an animal.\x1b[0m Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you in case you can't get to soap and water when you're out and about. Eat a well-balanced diet. Ask your doctor if you can eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Some doctors say it's OK as long as you wash the produce very well. Others say it's safer to just skip them. Stay away from raw meats, shellfish, and eggs. It may also be smart to avoid foods that have been linked to infection outbreaks in the past, like raw sprouts, berries, and fresh salsa. Don't eat deli foods, free food samples, or yogurt and ice cream products from soft-serve machines. Skip foods bought from self-serve or bulk bins. Don't buy dented cans or pre-cut fruits and veggies. Be careful around people. If you know that someone has a fever, cold, flu, or any other infection, stay away from them until they feel better. It's also best to skip large groups of people, so avoid shopping, schools, traveling, and crowds. If you do go out in public, use cleaning wipes before you touch door handles, elevator buttons, ATM keypads, or any other surface used by a lot of people. Take care of your body. Take a shower or bath every day. Pay special attention to your feet, armpits, and other sweaty areas. When you're done, use lotion so your skin doesn't get dry and crack. Consider using an electric shaver instead of a razor so you don't cut yourself. Brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Ask if it's OK to floss gently. Don't use alcohol-based mouthwashes -- your doctor or dentist may give you a special mouthwash. Use gloves. Be careful when you garden or do housework. Wear gloves so you don't hurt your hands or pick up germs from the soil. Use caution when you handle sharp things like scissors, knives, or gardening tools. Don't share. Don't use the same glasses, utensils, or food as others. Don't share towels, toothbrushes, or makeup, either. Watch what you touch. Try not to change diapers. If you do, wash your hands as soon as possible when you're done. Don't clean up after your pet in the yard, and don't touch dirt that could have animal droppings in it. Let someone else change the litter boxes, clean the birdcage, or clean the fish or turtle tanks.""]","When Iâm being treated for cancer, how often should I wash my hands?","When undergoing cancer treatment, it's crucial to maintain high hygiene standards due to your potentially weakened immune system [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m.

This includes a diet low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple sugars. A 2021 report in the journal Nutrients reported on multiple diets used in addition to standard medical therapies in PsA, IBD, and other inflammatory diseases. \x1b[92m[0] The report's authors note that Mediterranean (made up of whole grains, legumes, plenty of fruits and vegetables, and healthy fats), vegetarian/vegan, and reduced-calorie/fasting diets have yielded positive results.\x1b[0m Gluten-free diets, which eliminate a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley, and low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diets, which eliminate a certain class of carbohydrates, do not appear to impact IBD symptoms or systemic (all-over) inflammation in the study. Lifestyle "", ""https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/psoriasis-digestive-disorders\nIt may seem odd, but it's true. Psoriasis is related to some digestive disorders that are also autoimmune diseases. Right now, there isn't anything you can change about your lifestyle to specifically keep you from getting one of these digestive problems that's written into your genes. Research into the complex relationship is ongoing, and there's a lot more still to be learned. Here's what we know so far. There's a strong link between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. IBD includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis ( UC). Crohn's can affect any part of the stomach and intestines; UC usually affects the lower parts of your GI tract, the colon and rectum. After looking at the gene patterns of tens of thousands of people with serious autoimmune diseases, scientists are finding that the same problem genes can be responsible for psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. These conditions trigger inflammation in similar ways, too. Your skin and intestines are organs made up of tissue that absorbs things more easily, so it's not surprising that both are sensitive and react to the inflammation signals that travel throughout your body. One study found that 1 in 10 women with psoriasis develop an IBD. ( The odds were even higher for those with psoriatic arthritis, another condition linked with psoriasis.) People with psoriasis are 2.5 times more likely to get Crohn's and 1.6 times more likely to get UC. Some people get a digestive disorder first and psoriasis later. IBD and psoriasis also share a connection with obesity. Fat tissue seems to make chemicals that change how the body works, including the immune system. Having a lot of extra weight raises your odds of having psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. It can also make them get worse faster and make treatments less effective. When you have celiac disease, you can't digest gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease can damage your small intestine and prevent it from absorbing key nutrients. The chance of getting celiac disease is nearly 3 times higher among people with psoriasis. About 4 of every 100 have it. Research shows that the higher the levels of specific antibodies related to celiac disease, the worse psoriasis tends to be. Watch for signs of digestive issues, and tell your doctor so you can get tested and change your treatment plan, if needed. IBD ( Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) symptoms include: Diarrhea Belly cramps Blood in your poop Celiac disease or gluten sensitivity symptoms in adults may include: Diarrhea Bad-smelling poop Fatigue Feeling weak, dizzy, or short of breath Cold hands and feet Sore, achy joints You might mistake celiac disease for psoriatic arthritis, because both can cause joint pain and fatigue. Your doctor can order a blood test that measures levels of antibodies to check whether gluten affects you. It's often helpful to have a specialist called a gastroenterologist as well as a dermatologist on your health care team. You and your team can decide what treatment is right for you based on what and how severe your symptoms are and the medication side effects you're willing to deal with. The same drug may work for both your psoriasis and IBD. But some biologic medications are more likely than others to trigger a flare for someone who already has an IBD. \x1b[92m[1] Following a gluten-free diet has helped some people clear their psoriasis lesions as well as manage celiac.\x1b[0m What's more, going gluten-free has helped people who test positive for a gluten sensitivity even when they don't have any celiac symptoms or signs of the disease. \x1b[92m[2] Healthy habits -- including a nutritious diet and regular exercise -- can help you feel better, lower your chance of having flares, and get a better result from treatment.\x1b[0m Of course, take your medication as directed. Don't smoke, and limit how much alcohol you drink. Find ways to ease stress, maybe by joining a support group.

Also, try to measure your blood pressure at about the same time each day. Your doctor may want you to check your blood pressure several times during the day to see if it fluctuates. Find a quiet place to check your blood pressure. You will need to listen for your heartbeat. Make sure that you are comfortable and relaxed with a recently emptied bladder (a full bladder may affect your reading). Roll up the sleeve on your arm or remove any tight-sleeved clothing. Rest in a chair next to a table for 5 to 10 minutes. Your arm should rest comfortably at heart level. Sit up straight with your back against the chair, legs uncrossed. Rest your forearm on the table with the palm of your hand facing up. If you purchase a manual or digital blood pressure monitor (sphygmomanometer), follow the instruction booklet carefully. The following steps provide an overview of how to take your left arm blood pressure on either a manual or digital blood pressure monitor. Simply reverse the sides to take a blood pressure in your right arm. 1. Locate your pulse Locate your pulse by lightly pressing your index and middle fingers slightly to the inside center of the bend of your elbow (where the brachial artery is). If you cannot locate your pulse, place the head of the stethoscope (on a manual monitor) or the arm cuff (on a digital monitor) in the same general area. 2. Secure the cuff Slide the cuff onto your arm, making sure that the stethoscope head is over the artery (when using a manual monitor.) The cuff may be marked with an arrow to show the location of the stethoscope head. The lower edge of the cuff should be about 1 inch above the bend of your elbow. \x1b[92m[16] Use the fabric fastener to make the cuff snug, but not too tight.\x1b[0m Place the stethoscope in your ears. Tilt the ear pieces slightly forward to get the best sound. 3. Inflate and deflate the cuff If you are using a manual monitor: Hold the pressure gauge in your left hand and the bulb in your right. Close the airflow valve on the bulb by turning the screw clockwise. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb with your right hand. You may hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Watch the gauge. Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads about 30 points (mm Hg) above your expected systolic pressure. At this point, you should not hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Keeping your eyes on the gauge, slowly release the pressure in the cuff by opening the airflow valve counterclockwise. The gauge should fall only 2 to 3 points with each heartbeat. ( You may need to practice turning the valve slowly.) Listen carefully for the first pulse beat. As soon as you hear it, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats). Continue to slowly deflate the cuff. Listen carefully until the sound disappears. As soon as you can no longer hear your pulse, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats). Allow the cuff to completely deflate. You'll get the most accurate reading if your arm is held straight. If you released the pressure too quickly or could not hear your pulse, DO NOT inflate the cuff again right away. Wait one minute before repeating the measurement. Start by reapplying the cuff. If you are using a digital monitor: Hold the bulb in your right hand. Press the power button. All display symbols should appear briefly, followed by a zero. This indicates that the monitor is ready. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb with your right hand. If you have a monitor with automatic cuff inflation, press the start button. Watch the gauge. Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads about 30 points (mm Hg) above your expected systolic pressure. Sit quietly and watch the monitor. Pressure readings will be displayed on the screen. For some devices, values may appear on the left, then on the right. Wait for a long beep. This means that the measurement is complete. Note the pressures on the display screen. Systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats) appears on the left and diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats) on the right. Your pulse rate may also be displayed in between or after this reading. Allow the cuff to deflate. If you did not get an accurate reading, DO NOT inflate the cuff again right away. Wait one minute before repeating the measurement. Start by reapplying the cuff. 4. Record your blood pressure. Follow your doctor's instructions on when and how often you should measure your blood pressure. Record the date, time, systolic and diastolic pressures. You should also record any special circumstances like any recent exercise, meal, or stressful event. At least once a year, and especially after you first purchase your blood pressure monitor, bring your monitor with you to your doctor's visit to check the machine's accuracy.

"", ""https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/osteoarthritis-prevention-1\nBy age 65, more than half of us will have X-ray evidence of osteoarthritis, a disease in which the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones at the joints breaks down and bony overgrowth occurs. For many, the result is stiffness and pain in the joint. \x1b[92m[2] Although osteoarthritis (or OA) is more common as we age, it is not an inevitable part of aging.\x1b[0m As researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis, they are able to offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and lessen its impact on your life. Here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. If you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. If you are overweight, losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. Obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES), a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of Americans, showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. The risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. Being overweight strains the joints, particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees, hips, and joints of the feet, causing the cartilage to wear away. Weight loss of at least 5% of body weight may decrease stress on the knees, hips, and lower back. In a study of osteoarthritis in a population in Framingham, Mass., researchers estimated that overweight women who lost 11 pounds or about two body mass index ( BMI) points, decreased their risk of osteoarthritis by more than 50%, while a comparable weight gain was associated with an increased risk of later developing knee OA. If you already have osteoarthritis, losing weight may help improve symptoms. If the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak, research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. Fortunately, even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles, the quadriceps, can reduce the risk. To strengthen quadriceps, Todd P. Stitik, MD, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, recommends isometric moves and wall slides. To do these, stand with your back to a wall, with feet shoulder-width apart. Then lean back against the wall, placing your feet out in front of you as far as you comfortably can. Bend at the knees, put your hands on your waist, and slide with your spine, maintaining contact with the wall until you reach a sitting position. ( Your knees should not bend more than 90 degrees). Then slowly slide back to your original position. Repeat eight to 10 times. \x1b[92m[18] If fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising, try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers.\x1b[0m Doing so may make it easier to exercise and stay active. The safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints, such as bicycling, swimming, and other water exercise. Light weight lifting is another option, but if you already have osteoarthritis, first speak with your doctor. Suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. Injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. A long-term study of 1,321 graduates of Johns Hopkins Medical School found that people who injured a knee in adolescence or young adulthood were three times more likely to develop osteoarthritis in that knee, compared those who had not suffered an injury. People who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. To avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recommends the following: Avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. Keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. When jumping, land with knees bent. Do warm-up exercises before sports, even less vigorous ones such as golf. Cool down after vigorous sports. Wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. Exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. If you have a joint injury, it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage, such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. Although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis, certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. They include: Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats reduce joint inflammation, while unhealthy fats can increase it. Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils, including walnut, canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, and olive. Vitamin D. A handful of studies has shown that vitamin D supplements decreased knee pain in people with osteoarthritis. Your body makes most of the vitamin D it needs in response to sunlight. You can get more vitamin D in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and herring; vitamin D-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs. If you already have osteoarthritis, these same steps can be useful for reducing pain and other symptoms. In addition, there are many treatments your doctor can recommend or prescribe. \x1b[92m[11] They range from over-the-counter pain relievers to injections of corticosteroids or other compounds and, eventually, surgery to replace the painful, damaged joint.\x1b[0m""]",How do I reduce osteoarthritis (OA) pain?,"To reduce osteoarthritis (OA) pain, adopting a multifaceted approach is beneficial [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m.

It helps to know how the disease can affect your life, so you can make changes that will help. There's no cure for HS, so you'll have to manage the condition for life. For most people, it's a cycle of flare-ups and periods when their skin is clear. Breakouts tend to happen in the same general areas of your skin. But you may have a spot that stays broken-out all the time. Some women find their HS clears up after menopause. HS is called a progressive disease. That means it often gets worse over time. A small pimple can turn into a large boil within days or hours. If the boil ruptures underneath the skin, inflammation and infection spread quickly and new lumps form nearby. A flare-up may last a week or two. But treatment can keep HS from getting worse and help you avoid the most serious symptoms. The key is to start it early. Your symptoms and the way your body responds to treatment will determine how often you see your doctor. You may be able to manage mild symptoms on your own. If you take a drug that's injected or delivered through a vein, you may need to go in regularly. People with HS tend to have other conditions, too, such as severe acne, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Doctors don't know exactly why these conditions are linked. But it may be that whatever causes HS leads to other problems, too. It's rare, but people who have HS for a long time may be more likely to get a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. It's important to see your doctor regularly, keep her updated on how you feel, and talk about any new or unusual symptoms you've noticed. It depends on how severe your condition is. Large, deep nodules or lumps can hurt. And depending on where they are, you may not be able to sit or walk normally. Some people only get these painful lumps from time to time when the disease flares. But for others, the bumps or lumps never completely go away. Whether you have pain only during flares or more often, your doctor can help you control it. You may get numbing creams or over-the-counter or prescription pain medicine. The lumps themselves don't smell, but the fluid inside them does. When they burst and leak, the odor can escape, too. Wear loose clothing and try to keep things from rubbing against the cysts. Don't squeeze them. If they do burst, wash the area gently with an antiseptic cleanser to get rid of the smell. Antibiotics may also help. HS can be unpredictable. You may have a flare-up every few weeks, or you may go months with clear skin. Some women find they have breakouts before their periods. They may go away while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. There's no sure way to prevent breakouts. But they may not come back as often or be as bad if you follow your treatment plan, take any medication your doctor prescribes, and make some changes to your lifestyle. Get to a healthy weight. HS is closely tied to obesity. Losing weight is one of the best ways to keep it under control. Quit smoking. Stay cool. Your HS may get worse in the summer, when heat and sweat can trigger a flare-up. Swimming is a good way to get exercise without overheating. Don't shave near a breakout. If your razor irritates your skin, laser hair removal may be a better choice. Watch what you eat. There's some evidence that it may help to cut dairy and sugar from your diet.

Hormone replacement can reduce symptoms, particularly hot flashes. "", 'https://www.westdesmoinesobgyn.com/menopause-management-treatment/\nSimple lifestyle changes such as changing what you consume, your sleeping habits and how often you exercise can help relieve symptoms. \x1b[92m[4] For example, decreasing or avoiding caffeine and alcohol consumption completely can positively impact you; drinking water is the best alternative because it will keep your body hydrated.\x1b[0m Also, be sure to eat a well-balanced diet and increase your intake of Vitamins B, C, D and E by taking a women’s multivitamin.

Stress management: Mindfulness meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful ways to deal with stress.Lifestyle changes: Having a ventilated space and quitting smoking are some of the ways to improve your quality of life.

', ""https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/hormone-replacement-q-a\nIt depends on how long you've been taking it and why. Here are some facts to help you decide: You may be taking HRT to relieve menopause symptoms. At one time, doctors also used to prescribe HRT to manage diseases like osteoporosis and heart disease in women past menopause. But in 2002, a Women's Health Initiative study found that women who took the most common form of HRT, a combined estrogen and progesterone pill, had a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and blood clots. HRT and Menopause Symptoms: Research shows that a small dose of HRT is still the best way to reduce uncomfortable symptoms in early menopause. Women younger than age 60 have the lowest risks of other health problems from using HRT. Several years of treatment is usually enough to relieve symptoms. So if you've been on HRT for more than 5 years, talk with your doctor about tapering off. But you should remember that after stopping, you can expect the hot flushes to return. HRT and Heart Disease: Doctors no longer prescribe hormones to manage heart disease or other chronic conditions like osteoporosis. If you're taking HRT to reduce the risk of heart disease, ask your doctor about gradually stopping it. Before the WHI study, doctors prescribed HRT for heart problems. Some earlier studies showed that women who took hormones had lower rates of heart disease and other chronic diseases. The women may have just been healthier and had better access to medical care. The WHI study and follow-ups confirmed that HRT didn't reduce the risk of heart disease; it increased it in healthy, postmenopausal women. HRT and Osteoporosis: As with heart disease, you should weigh the benefits of using hormones with other risks. To reduce osteoporosis, doctors often suggest lifestyle changes such as regular weight-bearing exercise. You can also try medicine like Fosamax and Evista, or calcium and vitamin D supplements. Or you may look at other choices, such as statins, which reduce cholesterol in the blood, but also treat osteoporosis and heart disease. Experts are still not sure. You and your doctor should talk about which form of HRT might be right for you. Low-dose hormone replacement therapy: Studies show that lower doses of hormone replacement therapy offer the same benefits without as many risks. In a new study by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where the WHI research took place, women who took low-dose estrogen had 53% fewer hot flashes and night sweats. Estrogen alone: This is the suggested treatment for women who've had a hysterectomy to remove their uterus. Women who take estrogen alone have fewer risks of breast cancer and other disorders. Still, doctors caution that taking estrogen alone can increase your risk of stroke and uterine cancer. Bio-identical estrogen patches, creams, or vaginal rings: These forms of estrogen are similar to what the body makes. Unlike a pill, they enter the body through the skin or walls of the vagina. In this way, they bypass the liver, reducing the risk of serious blood clots or gallbladder disease. There is still a risk of both, but it will be less than if you were taking the equivalent dose of oral hormones. Soy or black cohosh: Soy and black cohosh supplements contain phytoestrogens, plant materials that may act like estrogen in the body. Some studies haven't found any proof that these â  naturalâ   therapies reduce menopause symptoms. Supplements aren't regulated or approved by the FDA, and phytoestrogens may increase risks for certain diseases. Antidepressants : Studies show antidepressants like Prozac and Effexor reduce hot flashes. One study found that venlafaxine, the main ingredient in Effexor, reduced hot flashes and night sweats by 48%. The results were similar to those for low-dose estrogen but without the risks. \x1b[92m[1] Lifestyle changes: Here are some other ways to cope with menopause symptoms: Dress in layers so you can remove clothes as needed.\x1b[0m Avoid hot and spicy foods and beverages. Use cotton sheets, and wear clothes that allow your skin to breathe. Limit caffeine and alcohol. Use relaxation techniques such as yoga. Don't smoke. Get regular exercise.

This can improve symptoms of the disease and reduce the risks of surgery. Medical therapy for Cushing syndrome is not a cure and may not completely improve all of the symptoms of too much cortisol. Medicines to control cortisol production at the adrenal gland include ketoconazole, osilodrostat (Isturisa), mitotane (Lysodren), levoketoconazole (Recorlev), and metyrapone (Metopirone). Mifepristone (Korlym, Mifeprex) is approved for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or high blood sugar.

You'll need to take a cortisol replacement medicine to give your body the right amount of cortisol. Most of the time, your body starts making enough cortisol again, and your health care provider can taper off the replacement medicine. Your endocrinologist may use blood tests to help decide if you need cortisol medicine and when it may be stopped. This process can take from six months to a year or more. Sometimes, people with Cushing syndrome need lifelong replacement medicine. Radiation therapyIf the surgeon can't totally remove a pituitary tumor, radiation therapy may be needed along with surgery. Radiation also may be used for people who can't have surgery. Radiation can be given in small doses over six weeks, or with a single, high dose of radiation. \x1b[92m[1] In both cases, your health care provider can plan your procedure in a way that reduces radiation exposure to other tissues.\x1b[0m "", 'https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cushing-syndrome\nvar s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context[\'wb.modimp\'] = \'vidfloat\'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $(\'.responsive-video-container\').insert After(\'.module-social-share-container\'); require([\'video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader\'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $(\'article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)\').attr(\'chronic_id\'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: \'in-article\', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $(\'.responsive-video-container\').remove(); }); } Cushing\'s syndrome is all about the stress hormone cortisol. When your body has too much of it, the excess hormone can throw off your body\'s other systems. Most cases of Cushing\'s syndrome can be cured, though it may take some time for your symptoms to ease up. The condition, also known as hypercortisolism, is more common in women than men. It\'s most often seen in people ages 25 to 40. You can get Cushing\'s syndrome when there\'s too much cortisol in your body for too long. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys. The most common cause is related to medications called glucocorticoids, also commonly known as steroids or prednisone. These prescription steroids are used for conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or after an organ transplant. They are powerful anti-inflammatory medications. Taking too much, for too long, can lead to Cushing\'s syndrome. A tumor in your pituitary gland, found at the base of the brain, or a tumor in the adrenal glands, can also prompt your body to make too much cortisol, which can lead to Cushing\'s. It\'s not usually a condition that\'s passed in families. In some rare cases, though, people develop it because a problem in their genes makes them more likely to get tumors on their glands. Your case might be different than someone else\'s, but when the disease is full-blown, common symptoms are: Rounded, rosy face Weight gain, especially upper body A fat pad in the upper back or base of the neck (you may hear this called a ""buffalo hump"") Thinning skin that is easy to bruise Acne Being very tired Weak muscles, especially when using your shoulders and hip muscles High blood pressure High blood sugar levels Depression and anxiety Osteoporosis Kidney stones Sleep problems Extra hair growth on your body and face Irregular periods Low sex drive and problems having an erection Your skin could become thin, heal slowly, and bruise easily. You might get purple or pink stretch marks all over your body, especially your belly, thighs, arms, and chest. Your bones may get weak. Everyday movements like bending, lifting, or even getting out of a chair can cause backaches or breaks in your ribs or spine. Children with Cushing\'s syndrome are usually very heavy, what doctors call obese, and tend to grow slowly. It might take several appointments to settle on your diagnosis. When you go to your doctor, she\'ll do a physical exam and ask you questions. What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Are you feeling more emotional? What medications are you taking? Your doctor will probably also recommend some of these tests to help screen for Cushing\'s syndrome if she suspects you have it: 24-hour urinary free cortisol test. This common test collects your urine for 24 hours to measure how much cortisol is in it. Dexamethasone suppression test . You\'ll take a low-dose steroid pill at 11:00 p.m. and then take a blood test in the morning to see how much cortisol your body still makes. Late-night salivary cortisol level. This test measures cortisol in your saliva. As the name suggests, these tests happen at night. If you have Cushing\'s syndrome, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who will do other blood tests or imaging scans to find out what\'s causing it. Will my symptoms change? If so, how? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? How will we know if they\'re working? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? When will I start to feel better? Does this condition put me at risk for any others? The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. That will lead to how to treat your condition. For instance, if you have too much cortisol because you\'re taking steroid medicines, your doctor will check to see if you can stop taking the drugs, or take a lower dose. If a tumor is causing your Cushing\'s syndrome, you\'ll likely have other tests to determine the location of the tumor first before deciding on your treatment. Surgery to remove the tumor may be best. If not, your doctor may be able to shrink the tumor with radiation or medicine. Eating well is an important part of living with Cushing\'s. A healthy diet can ease some symptoms and prevent others. \x1b[92m[3] Protect your bones by eating foods with calcium and vitamin D. Limit how much sodium and fatty foods you eat.\x1b[0m A nutritionist can help you make sure you\'re getting enough of the right nutrients. Let your family and friends know what you\'re going through. Ask for their support, and let them know how they can help. Take time for the people and activities you enjoy. It\'s OK to say no and set limits, so you keep your energy up. If you\'re feeling overwhelmed, talk to a counselor or therapist. Your doctor may be able to give you a referral. Your symptoms and how long they\'ll last depend on: The amount of extra cortisol you have The cause of your high cortisol How long you\'ve had the condition Your overall health Most of the time Cushing\'s syndrome can be treated and cured. If your Cushing\'s syndrome isn\'t curable, you\'ll want to look for ways to manage your weight gain, muscle weakness, and tiredness. Partner with your doctor on that, and tell your doctor how you\'re feeling. \x1b[92m[0] If you get depressed, it\'s important to get treated for that.\x1b[0m Look for ways to connect online and in person with people who have experience with Cushing\'s syndrome. You can learn more about living with the condition, and meet other people who have it, in forums on the Cushing\'s Support & Research Foundation web site.']",How should I take care of myself if I have Cushing's syndrome?,"If you have Cushing's syndrome, it's crucial to follow a tailored care plan under medical guidance [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m.

If you’re having a flare-up of Crohn’s disease you may also be advised to avoid getting pregnant until it’s under control. Complications Over time, inflammation can damage sections of the digestive system. This can result in complications such as: narrowing of the bowel (stricture) a channel developing between your bowel and your skin, another section of bowel or a body organ (fistula) These problems usually need surgical treatment.

Most medications for IBD don’t impact the ability to get pregnant and most medications are safe to continue during pregnancy. If you’re planning to become pregnant, review your medications and the safety of your medications with your doctor. If you’re on a medication that can’t be continued during pregnancy, your gastroenterologist can discuss alternative options with you. If you experience a Crohn’s flare-up while pregnant, you may need additional testing or treatment.

A large number of studies have looked at the effect of IBD on pregnancy, and not all the findings have been consistent. However, there is some evidence linking IBD with problems such as preterm (early) birth, babies with a low birth weight and, more rarely, miscarriages. That said, many experts believe that disease activity can be an important factor. \x1b[92m[8] Several studies have shown that most women with IBD who are in remission or have only mild active disease at the time they conceive, are very likely to have a normal uncomplicated pregnancy.\x1b[0m ', ""https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/articles/pregnancy-and-crohns-disease\n'We advise all patients to be closely monitored by both their gastroenterologist and OB or MFM specialist throughout pregnancy,' says Dr. Winter.

Patients may experience gastrointestinal symptoms during pregnancy that are not because of Crohn’s, and we follow patients closely to treat those symptoms and also evaluate whether they are due to flares or inflammation.' A gastroenterologist helps you manage Crohn’s symptoms and consults with your care team on how these could affect your pregnancy or birth. Your gastroenterologist may want to see you at least once during your first or second trimester for a checkup.

You have a better chance of a smooth pregnancy when your disease isn't flaring or when you haven't started a new treatment. Talk to both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist. Here are some things you may discuss before becoming pregnant: Medications for Crohn's don't usually affect a woman's chance of becoming pregnant. But some treatments -- such as sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) -- can affect a man's fertility. So men with Crohn's who hope to become fathers should talk to their doctors about changing medication. If you take methotrexate, your doctor will suggest you stop before your pregnancy. The drug can harm the baby. Men, too, should stop taking the drug several months before conception. If you are taking steroids, your doctor may suggest you wait to become pregnant. \x1b[92m[5] If you've had surgery for Crohn's you can still have a healthy pregnancy, but it may be harder to get pregnant.\x1b[0m If you are thinking about having surgery, talk to your doctor. You may want to put off surgery until after your pregnancy. \x1b[92m[14] When you're pregnant, have regular visits with both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist to monitor your baby's health and your Crohn's.\x1b[0m You should see a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine, because pregnancy with Crohn's is considered high risk. Some women say their Crohn's symptoms actually improve when they're pregnant and they have fewer flares. Make sure your doctors are aware of all the medications you are taking. If you're on a drug treatment plan that works for you, they may suggest you stay on it, but they may also suggest some changes to keep you and your baby safe. Tell your doctor if you take steroids, immunosuppressives, biologics, or even antibiotics, or anti-diarrhea drugs. You'll need to stop certain types of these drugs. Some medications, like sulfasalazine and other drugs in the aminosalicylate class, are considered safe while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. If you are thinking of becoming pregnant, you should consider adding folic acid supplements to your diet even before conception. These supplements will be needed throughout your pregnancy. You may need tests to monitor your Crohn's while you're pregnant. Some are OK, but there are other tests you may want to put off until after your baby is born. Your doctor can guide you on this decision. Ultrasounds, MRIs, and fetal monitoring devices are considered safe. If you are on steroids or have moderate to severe flares while pregnant, you may have frequent ultrasounds to check on your baby's growth. X-rays and CT scans may be necessary during pregnancy. To limit radiation exposure, abdominal shielding can be used. It's considered safe to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy, where a tube with a camera is placed in your colon to look for any problems. It is probably not a good idea to have a colonoscopy. The tests take a long time and patients usually get drugs to put them to sleep. You should also avoid X-rays and CT scans if possible. The radiation isn't good for a developing baby. Discuss your labor and delivery plans with your doctor well before your due date. If you have fistulas, abnormal passageways between organs, or other areas around your vagina or rectum that have been affected by Crohn's, your doctor may recommend you have a C-section. If you plan to breastfeed, talk to your doctor about your medications and if they're safe for your new baby.

Find out if blood sugar levels are high or low. Then, if needed, change treatment to treat high blood sugar or take fast-acting carbohydrates to treat low blood sugar. Track progress in reaching your treatment goals. Learn how diet and exercise affect blood sugar levels.

Monitoring blood glucose levels at home You may be checking and monitoring your blood glucose levels around four times per day, or even more if you’re using insulin. ', 'https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-1-diabetes\nType 1 diabetes happens when your immune system destroys cells in your pancreas called beta cells. They\'re the ones that make insulin. Some people get a condition called secondary diabetes. It\'s similar to type 1, except the immune system doesn\'t destroy your beta cells. They\'re wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body\'s tissues. Cells use it as fuel. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Glucose doesn\'t move into your cells because insulin isn\'t there to do it. Instead it builds up in your blood and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar, which can lead to: Dehydration. When there\'s extra sugar in your blood, you pee more. That\'s your body\'s way of getting rid of it. A large amount of water goes out with that urine, causing your body to dry out. Weight loss. The glucose that goes out when you pee takes calories with it. That\'s why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. Dehydration also plays a part. Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA). If your body can\'t get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body can\'t use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This combination of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as ""ketoacidosis"" and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Damage to your body. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes, kidneys, and heart. They can also make you more likely to get hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. It\'s rare. Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. It\'s more common in whites than in African- Americans. It affects men and women equally. Although the disease usually starts in people under 20, it can happen at any age. Doctors don\'t know all the things that lead to type 1 diabetes. But they do know your genes play a role. They also know type 1 diabetes can result when something in the environment, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas. Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They\'re present in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases, like Grave\'s disease or vitiligo. These are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Heavy thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Nausea and vomiting Pain in your belly Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss (even though you\'re eating and feel hungry) Fatigue (weak, tired feeling) Blurred vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor will call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of the skin, urinary tract, or vagina Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Pain in your belly Loss of consciousness (rare) If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, he\'ll check your blood sugar levels. He may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don\'t have enough insulin. Right now there\'s no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Many people with type 1 diabetes live long, healthy lives. \x1b[92m[4] The key to good health is to keep your blood sugar levels within the range your doctor gives you.\x1b[0m You\'ll need to check them often and adjust insulin, food, and activities to make that happen. All people with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, he\'ll mention three main things: "" Onset"" is the length of time before it reaches your bloodstream and begins lowering blood sugar. "" Peak time"" is the time when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering blood sugar. "" Duration"" is how long it keeps working after onset. Several types of insulin are available. Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks around 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps working for 3 to 6 hours. Intermediate-acting won\'t get into your bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after injection. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours and works for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts for about 24 hours. Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two different types of insulin. You may progress to three or four shots a day. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end, and give yourself the shot. Some now comes in a prefilled pen. One kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump -- a device you wear that sends it into your body via a small tube. Your doctor will help you to pick the type and the delivery method that\'s best for you. Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn\'t as simple as going out for a run. You have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Knowledge is power. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you. Some things will make your levels go up; others won\'t. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to prevent it from dropping too low. If your test is high, test for ketones -- acids that can result from high sugar levels. If they\'re OK, you should be good to go. If they\'re high, skip the workout. You\'ll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started. If you don\'t keep your type 1 diabetes well controlled, you could set yourself up for serious or life-threatening problems: Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. It\'s rare before puberty no matter how long you\'ve had the disease. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Kidney damage. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chances grow over time. It\'s most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems like kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood circulation and nerve damage. Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of sensation in and a lack of blood supply to your feet. This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. And when that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.']",When should I check my blood sugar if I have type 1 diabetes?,"If you have type 1 diabetes, it's crucial to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.

79,191,"['https://www.myhealthmylife.com.my/en-MY/Healthy-Living/Relaxation-techniques\nThe many types of relaxation exercises1,2 1. Deep Breathing One of the simplest ways to relax is to practice deep breathing. You can do deep breathing almost anywhere. Sit still or lie down and place one hand on your stomach. Put your other hand over your heart Inhale slowly until you feel your stomach rise. Hold your breath for a moment Exhale slowly, feeling your stomach fall Repeat a few times 2. Guided Imagery2,3 This technique teaches to focus on pleasant images to replace negative or stressful feelings. Guided imagery may be self-directed or led by a practitioner or a recording Set aside 10 or 20 minutes. \x1b[92m[1] Find a quiet place and close your eyes Take a few slow breaths to relax Imagine being somewhere that makes you feel calm, like sitting on a tropical beach, or on a favorite park bench.\x1b[0m Think about what you might experience there. 3. Meditation1,4 ', 'https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/peripheral-neuropathy-diabetes-pain-relief\nSome people with diabetes and the nerve pain -- or peripheral neuropathy that comes with it -- find relief in surprisingly simple ways. Sometimes a nice, warm (but not hot) bath is enough to relieve stress and nerve pain. If you have neuropathy, by the way, you might want to have someone else test the water to make sure it\'s not too hot. A massage can also help. Other people turn to biofeedback, meditation, relaxation techniques, or hypnosis -- all of which have been proven to help. "" These methods of alternative medicine have shown tremendous promise,"" says Tom Elasy, MD, director of the Diabetes Clinic at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. "" I have many patients who have pursued alternative approaches, and I get very positive feedback about the results."" It is possible, through biofeedback, to train the body to decrease the severity of diabetes nerve pain. This involves consciously controlling a body function that is normally regulated by the body -- like skin temperature, heart rate, or blood pressure. It may sound like science fiction, but evidence of the benefits of biofeedback is quite good. It\'s been used to help control migraine pain, epilepsy seizures, high blood pressure, and other common problems. How does it work? You wear sensors on your head and elsewhere that let you ""hear"" or ""see"" certain bodily functions such as pulse, digestion, body temperature, and muscle tension. The squiggly lines and/or beeps on the attached monitors reflect what\'s going on inside your body. Then you learn to control those beeps and squiggles. After a few sessions, your mind has trained your biological system to learn the skills. It is not hard to master, say experts. Meditation is a therapy offered in many pain treatment centers for diabetes and other painful disorders. Research shows that meditation can lower blood pressure and improve heart rate, breathing, and brain waves. Tension and tightness seep from muscles as the body receives a quiet message to relax. The soothing power of repetition is at the heart of meditation. Focusing on the breath, ignoring thoughts, and repeating a word or phrase -- a mantra -- makes the body relax. People describe feeling warmth, calm, even a sense of heaviness while they meditate. While you can learn meditation on your own, it helps to take a class. A teacher can guide you -- and help you reach that deeper, more relaxed state. Stress can make neuropathy pain worse, so it is important to learn to relax. Your breathing pattern is often affected by changes in emotions. That\'s why managing your breathing is an important tool for relaxation. By becoming familiar with your own breathing patterns, you can learn to control your breathing, stress level, and pain as well. First, find a quiet location, a comfortable body position, and a good state of mind. Try to block out worries and distracting thoughts. Relaxation techniques to help with diabetes nerve pain include: Rhythmic breathing: Take long, slow breaths. Inhale slowly, and then exhale slowly. Count slowly to five as you inhale. Then count slowly to five as you exhale. Pay attention to how your body naturally relaxes. This will help you relax even more. Deep breathing: Imagine a spot just below your navel. Breathe into that spot, filling the abdomen with air. Let the air fill you from the abdomen up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. \x1b[92m[0] Visualized breathing: Find a comfortable place where you can close your eyes.\x1b[0m Picture relaxation entering your body -- and tension leaving the body. Breathe deeply, but in a natural rhythm. Visualize the breath coming into your nostrils, going into your lungs. Picture it expanding your chest and abdomen. Then, visualize the breath going out the same way. Each time you exhale, imagine you are getting rid of a little more tension. Relax to music: Put on some music that lifts your mood and that you find soothing and calming. There are specially designed relaxation audio tapes or CDs that are perfect for this. Mental imagery relaxation: This is also called guided imagery. It is a form of ""mental escape"" in which you create calming, peaceful images in your mind. You also identify self-talk -- your thoughts about your illness -- and focus on positive thoughts and emotions instead. Self-hypnosis is the path to training both mind and body to make a desired change such as controlling diabetes pain. It is a skill that must be learned from a trained therapist and involves focusing attention for a desired purpose. With practice, hypnotizing yourself can be easy. You focus your attention on an image that blocks the perception of pain -- and you feel less pain. Your subconscious has grabbed hold of that message, replaying it time and again. The mind has learned to control the body. Scientists say hypnosis seems to block nerve pain receptors in the brain. Those receptors control sensations of pain, anxiety, and discomfort. Studies have shown that pain related to cancer, surgery, back injuries, and migraines responds well to hypnosis. A growing number of people are using acupuncture to treat neuropathy pain linked with diabetes and other health-related problems. What is acupuncture? It is a practice in which fine needles are inserted into the skin to stimulate specific points in the body. Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the theory that energy flows through the body along certain pathways, called â  chi\'. Illness or pain results when that energy is blocked or out of balance. The Chinese theory holds that acupuncture unblocks or balances that flow of energy. Many Western researchers say acupuncture may alter brain chemicals that affect the body and mind. Translated into the language of Western medicine, the healing power of acupuncture may come from its effect on the nervous system, on hormones, and on ""feel good"" brain chemicals called endorphins. One landmark study found that patients have reduced pain and improved movement with acupuncture. The National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization have both approved certain uses of acupuncture related to pain. Acupuncture also appears to be very safe. Relatively few complications from the use of acupuncture have been reported to the FDA even though millions of people are treated with acupuncture each year, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Still, poorly sterilized needles or improper treatments have caused some complications. It\'s important to make sure you go to well-trained and experienced acupuncturist. Your doctor may be able to help you with a recommendation.']",How can I practice mental imagery relaxation for diabetic nerve pain?,"To practice mental imagery relaxation for diabetic nerve pain, find a quiet, comfortable space and close your eyes [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m.

If you have any questions about your treatment, don’t be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse. \x1b[92m[1] Surgery Surgery to remove the testicle is one of the main treatments for testicular cancer.\x1b[0m The operation is called an orchidectomy. It can be done as a day patient or during a short stay in hospital. You may feel shocked and scared at the thought of having this done. Your doctor and nurse will tell you more about it so that you know what to expect. ', 'https://www.cancervic.org.au/cancer-information/types-of-cancer/testicular_cancer/diagnosing-testicular.html\nDoctors will use your tumour marker levels to assess the risk of the cancer coming back after surgery, and this helps them plan your treatment. \x1b[92m[8] If the diagnosis of testicular cancer is confirmed after surgery, you will have regular blood tests to monitor tumour marker levels throughout treatment and as part of follow-up appointments.\x1b[0m Tumour marker levels will drop if your treatment is successful, but they will rise if the cancer is active. If this happens, you may need more treatment. Surgery to remove the testicle The only way to be sure of the diagnosis is to surgically remove the affected testicle and examine it in a laboratory. The surgery to remove a testicle is called an orchidectomy or orchiectomy. In most cases, the surgeon needs to remove only one testicle. ', 'https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/testicular-cancer/if-you-have-testicular-cancer.html\nBased on the stage of the cancer, how long do you think I’ll live? What will happen next? What kind of treatment will I need? There are many ways to treat testicular cancer. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant are the main types of treatment. \x1b[92m[0] The treatment plan that’s best for you will depend on: The stage and grade of the cancer The chance that a type of treatment will cure the cancer or help in some way Your age Other health problems you have Your feelings about the treatment and the side effects that come with it Surgery for testicular cancer Surgery to take out the testicle is often the first treatment for testicular cancer.\x1b[0m It’s used even when the cancer has spread.

Talk to your doctor about what will be done and what you can expect Side effects of surgery ', 'https://cancer.org.au/cancer-information/types-of-cancer/testicular-cancer\n\x1b[92m[3] Treatment for testicular cancerStagingIn addition to the results of the diagnostic tests above, a chest x-ray and CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis are done to determine whether and how far the cancer has spread.Stage 1 means the cancer is found only in the testicle, stage 2 means it has spread to the lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis, and stage 3 means the cancer has spread beyond the lymph nodes to other areas of the body such as the lungs and liver.If the cancer is found only in the testicle (stage 1), removal of the testicle (orchidectomy) may be the only treatment needed.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] If the cancer has spread beyond the testicle, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be used as well.Palliative careIn some cases of testicular cancer, your medical team may talk to you about palliative care.\x1b[0m Palliative care aims to improve your quality of life by alleviating symptoms of cancer.As well as slowing the spread of testicular cancer, palliative treatment can relieve pain and help manage other symptoms. Treatment may include radiation therapy (radiotherapy), chemotherapy or other drug therapies.Treatment TeamDepending on your treatment, your treatment team may consist of a number of different health professionals, such as:GP (General Practitioner) ', 'https://www.kucancercenter.org/cancer/cancer-types/testicular-cancer\nAfter surgery, your doctor may recommend you wait and watch to see what happens. This is called watchful waiting. \x1b[92m[10] You’ll schedule regular checkups with your doctor to make sure the cancer is gone.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[5] In addition to surgery, your doctor may recommend radiation and/or chemotherapy: Radiation therapy uses high-dose X-rays to destroy cancer cells.\x1b[0m Radiation is usually used to treat a kind of cancer called seminoma. However, radiation therapy can sometimes be used to kill leftover cancer cells or to treat cancer that has spread beyond the testes. Radiation treatment for testicular cancer is directed at a specific area on your body. It is given on an outpatient basis, usually 5 days a week for about 3 weeks. Chemotherapy uses medicines to destroy cancer cells. You may receive it by injection or through your veins. Chemotherapy drugs are used to kill cancer cells that remain throughout the body after surgery for testicular cancer, and may be used before radiation.

It is very important to go to all your appointments. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It may be given to reduce the risk of testicular cancer coming back. It may also be used to treat testicular cancer that has already spread or come back after treatment. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support Occasionally, higher doses of chemotherapy might be used. We have more information on high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support for testicular cancer. Radiotherapy ', 'https://www.mainehealth.org/mainehealth-cancer-care/cancer-conditions-services/testicular-cancer\nStaging Testicular CancerThere are 3 stages of testicular cancer. \x1b[92m[2] Knowing the stage is helpful to decide which treatment option is the best option.Stage 1: Cancer is in the testicle.Stage 2: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen.Stage 3: Cancer has spread to other areas in the body.There are several different treatment optionsYour doctor and care team will help you decide which treatment option is best for you based on the stage of cancer, other medical conditions, and your own preferences.Surgery: There are two surgical procedures that can be used, depending on the stage of testicular cancer.Radical inguinal orchiectomy: surgery to remove the testicle.Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: surgery to remove lymph nodes in the abdomen.Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can be used as the only treatment or in combination with a surgical treatment.Chemotherapy: the medicine is taken as pills or injected as a shot.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[4] The medicine travels through the body and kills cancer cells.Radiation therapy: high-powered beams are used to kill cancer cells in the body.Both chemotherapy and radiation may be recommended in conjunction with surgery\x1b[0m ', ""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/preventing-testicular-cancer\nCells in the body normally divide (reproduce) only when new cells are needed. Sometimes cells will divide for no reason and without order, creating a mass of tissue called a tumor. Tumors can be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Testicular cancer is a malignant tumor in a testicle. The testicles are oval-shaped sex glands in a sac of skin called the scrotum. The scrotum is located behind the penis. This type of cancer, although relatively rare, mostly affects men between ages 15 and 35 (although it can affect males at any age), and in a man's 60s. You can detect testicular cancer by doing a monthly testicular self-exam. Such an exam is a way that men can look for signs of cancer of the testicles. To do a self-exam, follow these steps. Do the exam after a warm shower or bath. The warmth relaxes the skin of the scrotum, making it easier to feel for anything unusual. Use both hands to examine each testicle. Place your index and middle fingers underneath the testicle and your thumbs on top. Roll the testicle between your thumbs and fingers. ( It's normal for testicles to be different sizes.) As you feel the testicle, you may notice a cord-like structure on top and in back of the testicle. This structure is called the epididymis. It stores and transports sperm. Do not confuse it with a lump. Feel for any lumps. Lumps can be pea-size or larger and are often painless. If you notice a lump, contact your doctor. Also check for any change in size, shape, or consistency of the testes. You should also get a physical exam once a year. After a while, you will know how your testicles feel and will be more alert to any changes. Symptoms of testicular cancer include: A lump in either testicle. An enlarged (swollen) testicle. A dull ache in the lower abdomen or groin. A sudden gathering of fluid in the scrotum. Feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. Low back pain Swollen breasts If you have symptoms of testicular cancer, don't panic. Many times, changes in the testicles are not cancer. But, you should contact your doctor to find the cause of your symptoms. During your visit, you will be asked to talk about symptoms and any illnesses you have had in the past. The doctor will feel the scrotum for lumps. Samples of blood and urine may be taken for testing. An ultrasound exam of the scrotum and its contents may be performed. ( Ultrasound is a painless test that creates images by using high-frequency sound waves that are transmitted through body tissues.) You also may be given a chest X-ray or computed tomography ( CT) scan. When testicular cancer is present, the testicle typically is removed. In most men, removing the testicle should not lead to problems with having children or sex. The remaining testicle will continue making sperm and the male hormone testosterone. To re-establish a normal appearance, a man may be able to have a testicular prosthesis surgically implanted in the scrotum which looks and feels like a normal testicle. \x1b[92m[7] If the cancer has already spread, either radiation therapy or chemotherapy is needed.\x1b[0m Most cases of testicular cancer can be cured, even if the cancer has spread.""]",What should I expect if testicular cancer is found in me?,"If testicular cancer is diagnosed in you, expect a treatment plan tailored to your specific case, often starting with surgery to remove the affected testicle [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m.

Loss of consciousness. Request an appointment CausesPeanut allergy occurs when the immune system flags peanut proteins as harmful. When exposed to peanuts, the immune system releases symptom-causing chemicals into the bloodstream. These chemicals cause an allergic reaction. Direct and cross-contact with peanuts could cause a reaction: Direct contact. The most common cause of peanut allergy is eating peanuts or foods that contain peanuts. Cross-contact. This happens when peanuts get into a product by mistake. It often happens when food is exposed to peanuts during processing or handling. Inhalation. Breathing in dust or aerosols containing peanuts, such as peanut flour, may cause an allergic reaction. ', ""https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/nut-peanut-allergy.html\nWhen someone has a peanut allergy, the body's immune system, which normally fights infections, overreacts to proteins in peanuts. \x1b[92m[15] If the person drinks or eats a product that contains peanuts, the body thinks these proteins are harmful invaders.\x1b[0m The immune system responds by working very hard to fight off the invader. This causes an allergic reaction. Peanuts aren't actually a true nut; they're a legume (in the same family as peas and lentils). Peanuts are among the most common allergy-causing foods, and they often find their way into things you wouldn't expect. Take chili, for example: It may be thickened with ground peanuts. Sometimes people outgrow some food allergies over time, but peanut allergies are lifelong in many people. What Are the Signs & Symptoms of a Peanut Allergy? When someone with a peanut allergy has something with peanuts in it, the body releases chemicals like histamine, which can cause symptoms such as: wheezing trouble breathing coughing hoarseness "", ""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peanut-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376175\nPatient Care & Health Information Diseases & Conditions Peanut allergy Request an Appointment Symptoms &causesDiagnosis &treatmentDoctors &departments Print OverviewPeanut allergy is a condition that causes the body's germ-fighting immune system to react to peanuts.

The immune system identifies the food or substance as a danger and sets off a protective response, with mild to severe symptoms that may include vomiting, hives, repetitive cough, tongue swelling, and/or shortness of breath. The allergic reaction often occurs within minutes to two hours of exposure to the food allergen. \x1b[92m[6] Anaphylaxis—a whole-body reaction that can impair breathing, cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure, and affect heart rate—can be fatal.\x1b[0m This type of reaction must be treated quickly with an injection of epinephrine (often known as an EpiPen®, one of many brands), which can reverse severe symptoms immediately by reducing throat swelling to open the airways.

If you think you or someone you know is experiencing anaphylaxis, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. Non-IgE-mediated food allergy Another type of allergic reaction is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy. The symptoms of this type of allergy can take much longer to develop – sometimes up to several days. Some symptoms of a non IgE-mediated food allergy may be what you would expect to see in an allergic reaction, such as: redness and itchiness of the skin – although not a raised, itchy red rash (urticarial) ', ""https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/nut-peanut-allergy.html\nthroat tightness belly pain vomiting diarrhea itchy, watery, or swollen eyes hives red spots swelling a drop in blood pressure, causing lightheadedness or loss of consciousness (passing out) anxiety or a feeling something bad is happening Allergic reactions to peanuts can differ. Sometimes the same person can react differently at different times. Some reactions can be very mild and involve only one system of the body, like hives on the skin. Other reactions can be more severe and involve more than one part of the body. \x1b[92m[2] Peanut allergy can cause a severe reaction called anaphylaxis, even if a previous reaction was mild.\x1b[0m Anaphylaxis might start with some of the same symptoms as a less severe reaction, but can quickly get worse. The person may have trouble breathing or pass out. More than one part of the body might be involved. \x1b[92m[0] If it isn't treated, anaphylaxis can be life-threatening.\x1b[0m How Is an Allergic Reaction Treated? "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_allergy\n\x1b[92m[11] Peanut allergy is one of the most dangerous food allergies, and one of the least likely to be outgrown.\x1b[0m In Western countries, the incidence of peanut allergy is between 1.5% and 3%. There has been a sudden increase in number of cases in the early 21st century. It is one of the most common causes of food-related deaths. A meta-analysis found that death due to overall food-induced anaphylaxis was 1.8 per million person-years in people having food allergies, with peanut as the most common allergen. However, there are opinions that the measures taken in response to the threat may be an over-reaction out of proportion to the level of danger. Media sensationalism has been blamed for anxiety outweighing reality. ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_allergy\n\x1b[92m[12] Airborne particles in a farm- or factory-scale shelling or crushing environment, or from cooking, can produce respiratory effects in exposed allergic individuals.\x1b[0m Empirical testing has discredited some reports of this type and shown some to be exaggerated. Residue on surfaces has been known to cause minor skin rashes, though not anaphylaxis. \x1b[92m[13] In The Peanut Allergy Answer Book, Harvard pediatrician Michael Young characterized this secondary contact risk to allergic individuals as rare and limited to minor symptoms.\x1b[0m Some reactions have been noted to be psychosomatic in nature, the result of conditioning, and belief rather than a true chemical reaction. Blinded, placebo-controlled studies were unable to produce any reactions using the odor of peanut butter or its mere proximity. Rarely, allergic reactions have been triggered by exposure from kissing and sexual contact, especially if the partner has eaten peanuts within the last hour. ', ""https://www.webmd.com/allergies/peanut-allergy\nPeanuts were once a snack-time staple, but these days, they are largely off-limits for a growing number of kids and adults. It's common now not to serve certain foods at birthday parties or school to keep kids with peanut allergies safe. \x1b[92m[14] It can seem scary how much damage a little piece of food can do, but you can lower the risk of having a severe reaction if you learn how to spot your symptoms and avoid peanuts.\x1b[0m Children -- especially toddlers and infants -- are more likely to develop food allergies. If you or other family members have other types of allergies, peanuts could be a problem. Also, if you have eczema, you may also be more likely to be allergic. If you have peanut allergy, that doesn't have to mean you are more likely to have a problem with other nuts or legumes. Peanuts grow underground and are different from almonds, cashews, walnuts and other tree nuts. Recent studies found that 25% to 40% of people who have peanut allergy are allergic to tree nuts, too. Most people who are allergic have trouble when they have direct contact with peanuts -- whether eating them by accident or not realizing they are part of a salad or recipe. It can also happen through skin contact or by breathing in peanut dust or eating something made with peanut oil. \x1b[92m[9] But did you know that if you are very sensitive, indirect contact can trigger a reaction?\x1b[0m It's called cross-contact. For instance, a chef might be making a meal for you. It contains no peanuts, but she may have used her knife for an earlier task. \x1b[92m[10] If the knife touched peanuts and wasn't washed well, trace pieces could get into your dish.\x1b[0m Make sure any restaurant or dinner host is aware and taking care to avoid cross-contact. \x1b[92m[5] Symptoms of an allergic response to peanuts will usually start within minutes of exposure, and they can include: Tightening in the throat Shortness of breath or wheezing Skin reaction such as hives or redness Tingling or itching in the mouth or throat Diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps or vomiting A runny nose This is a life-threatening allergic reaction and needs emergency treatment.\x1b[0m Peanuts are one of the most common causes of anaphylaxis, which can affect several parts of the body all at once. Your risk may be higher if you have allergies or asthma, a family history of anaphylaxis or if it's happened to you before. Certain people with known peanut allergies should carry an injector. You can get one from your doctor. If the symptoms strike, use your epinephrine (adrenaline) injector, such as Adrenaclick, Auvi- Q, Epi Pen, Symjepi or a generic version of the auto-injector.. Call 911 even if you start to feel better. You will still need emergency medical care because you may have a delayed reaction. \x1b[92m[8] The signs of an attack include: Swelling of the throat that makes it hard to breathe Dizziness or fainting A big drop in blood pressure A rapid pulse Blocked airways To find out whether you have a problem with peanuts, your doctor might ask you to keep a food diary.\x1b[0m He can track your eating habits and any symptoms you jot down. If you've never had a severe reaction, he might suggest what's called an â  elimination diet.â   You would cut out peanuts or other suspected foods for a week or longer. Then you would add them back in one at a time to see what might be causing you to react. Your doctor may also do a skin test, placing a small amount of the food on you and then pricking it with a needle. If you are allergic to peanuts, you will develop a raised bump or reaction. You may also need a blood test to check to see whether your immune system launches an allergic reaction to peanuts. Foods that contain peanuts have to say so on the label. That's the law in the United States. Read all food labels every time, because ingredients can change. There might be nuts in something you didn't think had them. If you aren't sure, check with the product's maker. There is no easy fix for the allergy. The only way to prevent a bad reaction is to avoid peanuts. But no matter how careful you are, you may still come into contact with them because they're so common. It is important to know how to act fast in a life-threatening case. Peanut allergies usually are lifelong for most people. But research finds that about 20% of children who have the allergy outgrow it eventually.""]",What problems can peanuts cause if you have an allergy?,"If you have a peanut allergy, consuming peanuts can trigger severe reactions, ranging from mild symptoms like hives and gastrointestinal discomfort to life-threatening conditions such as anaphylaxis [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m.

They tend to live in indoor and outdoor spaces where people don't go most of the time. If you do find yourself in the same place as one, though, it won't want to attack you -- it'll want to get out of your way.

They produce harmful venom that may cause a painful sore at the site of the bite. It may cause even more severe symptoms in some people. If you have a run-in with a brown recluse, it's wise to have a doctor check you out, just in case. A brown recluse might not be brown, but tan. It has a violin-shaped area on the front half of its body, with the neck of the violin pointing toward the spider's abdomen. It may be bigger than other spiders that you're used to seeing. Its body can range in size from a quarter-inch to three-quarters of an inch, and its long legs make it appear even larger. Most spiders have eight eyes, but a brown recluse spider has six. Two are in the front, and there are two more on each side of its head. Brown recluses are found mostly in the Midwest or the South. The spider favors indoor spaces, like attics, garages or dark closets. Outdoors, it hides in out-of-the-way places -- under logs, beneath porches, or within piles of rocks. A bite might not hurt at first or even leave a mark. For some people, it feels like a pinch or a bee sting. Within the first day or two after you've been bitten, you may notice: Pain or redness at the site of the bite A deep sore (ulcer) that forms where you were bitten, with the skin at the center turning purple Fever Chills Nausea Joint pain Feeling weak Seizures or coma (very rare) Your doctor will want to be as certain as he can that you were, in fact, bitten by a spider. It'll help if you can describe what the spider looked like. Some people try to catch the bug to show the doctor. That's fine, as long as you can do it safely. You might just try to take a photo of it. If you suspect your small child was bitten by a brown recluse, see your doctor right away. Their bodies can't ward off the dangerous effects of the spider's venom. For adults, most brown recluse spider bites can be treated at home with good results. But about 10% of them cause ulcers or blisters that damage your skin so badly that you need a doctor's care. If your symptoms are mild, try these simple home remedies: Clean it with soap and water. Apply antibiotic cream. If you were bitten on an arm or leg, keep it raised while you're resting. This can reduce swelling. Put ice on it. \x1b[92m[2] Take over-the-counter pain medicine.\x1b[0m Watch for more severe symptoms. See a doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms: The bite has formed an ulcer or blister with a dark (blue, purple or black) center. You're in extreme pain. You have an infection at the site of the bite. You're having trouble breathing. Some spider bites can have tetanus spores, so you might need a tetanus shot after you've been bitten.

Contributing factors to the development of atherosclerosis include obesity and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a pre-diabetic condition marked by an impaired response to insulin, the main hormone involved in the transfer of food energy to cells throughout the body.

For many people, problems arise when they eat too many foods that contain cholesterol and ones high in saturated fat (such as red meat and whole-fat dairy products) that, over time, increase the total amount of cholesterol in their body. It then begins to circulate in the bloodstream, building up on the artery walls and forming plaque. \x1b[92m[12] This buildup, called atherosclerosis, can cause narrowed blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\x1b[0m The health issues caused by atherosclerosis have different names, depending on which arteries (a type of blood vessel) are affected. 'When cholesterol plaque is in the heart arteries, we call it ‘coronary artery disease,’' says Yale Medicine cardiologist Antonio Giaimo, MD. \x1b[92m[11] 'When it’s in the neck arteries, we call it ‘carotid artery disease.’ In the leg and abdominal arteries, we call that ‘peripheral artery disease.’' Additional problems arise when plaque builds up within the arteries and a piece breaks off, traveling through the bloodstream and lodging in a blood vessel, preventing blood from flowing.\x1b[0m 'Those blockages can be sudden—blockages of the heart’s blood vessels are usually what cause heart attacks,' says Yale Medicine cardiologist Ehimen Aneni, MD, MPH. 'It’s similar to stroke, which is caused by blockages to blood vessels in the neck or brain.' To diagnose or prevent these issues, your physician will check your cholesterol regularly to see if it’s too high.

It\'s a ""silent"" problem with big implications, such as a four-fold increase in the likelihood of having a heart attack or stroke. A simple blood test is all it takes to check your triglyceride levels. If they\'re too high, you can get them back under control, often by changing your daily habits. If you already know that your triglyceride levels are too high, the actions you take now might even save your life. Having high triglycerides could be a sign that you\'re becoming insulin-resistant, which means your body isn\'t using insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar) properly. When insulin doesn\'t do its job, glucose can\'t get into your cells. That raises your blood sugar levels, which can lead to pre-diabetes and, eventually, type 2 diabetes. Having diabetes makes you much more likely to have a heart attack and other heart problems, in addition to the risk from your high triglycerides. Untreated diabetes is a major health threat. \x1b[92m[14] To manage it well, you may need to track everything you eat, test your blood sugar, exercise, lose extra weight, take medication as directed, and keep up with your medical appointments.\x1b[0m Many people don\'t know that they have diabetes. Your doctor should check on whether you do, and if so, help you get both your diabetes and your triglycerides under control. High triglyceride levels can be a clue that you have fatty liver disease. Poor eating habits lead not only to high levels of fat in the bloodstream (triglycerides) but increased storage of fat throughout the body, including in the liver. Elevations in liver function tests (like ALT and AST) can indicate that fatty liver is present. Fatty liver usually does not cause symptoms, but unless reversed, fatty liver can lead to permanent liver damage and cirrhosis. If your triglyceride levels are â  very highâ   -- above 500 mg/d L -- you are more likely to get inflammation in your pancreas. Inflammation of the pancreas (a condition which doctors call pancreatitis) can cause permanent tissue damage. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, which may be severe. If you have high triglycerides, your doctor\'s treatment should include healthy eating and exercise. Avoiding processed and sugary foods is paramount; these dietary changes alone can have a tremendous impact on your triglyceride levels. Your doctor may also recommend taking omega 3 fatty acid supplements. Begin today. Talk to your doctor or other health care provider about exactly what you need to do to start living a healthy lifestyle to lower triglycerides, help prevent a heart attack or stroke, avoid or manage diabetes, and reduce your chances of developing liver disease and pancreatitis.']",What should I know about high triglyceride levels?,"High triglyceride levels in the blood are a significant health concern, often indicating an increased risk of heart disease and stroke [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m.

"", ""https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/nonprescription-treatments-nerve-pain\nWhatever the cause, nerve pain can be a serious and debilitating condition. People who have it often need help from a doctor and prescription treatments. There are also some nonprescription treatments for neuropathic pain that may help relieve your symptoms. You might use some of these approaches along with your prescribed treatment. If your nerve pain is mild, they may be enough on their own to manage your nerve pain. Here's a rundown of your options. Topical painkillers. Many over-the-counter creams and ointments are sold to relieve nerve pain. They include ingredients that work as a local anesthetic, numbing the pain in the area where you apply them. Some contain capsaicin, a painkiller derived from chili peppers. Others use different natural ingredients, like botanical oils. One advantage of topical treatments is that you can apply them precisely where you need relief. Painkilling medicines. \x1b[92m[0] Some people with neuropathic pain turn to familiar over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen, aspirin, and ibuprofen.\x1b[0m While these drugs might help with mild or occasional pain, they're often not strong enough for serious nerve pain. There's also a risk that someone with chronic pain might begin to rely on these medicines too much. So, always make sure to follow the directions on the bottle. Most painkillers should never be taken for more than 10 days. If you are still in pain and want to take them for longer than that, you need to talk with your doctor -- it may be a sign that you need a different treatment. Supplements and vitamins. In some cases, nerve pain can be worsened -- or even caused -- by a deficiency of vitamin B12. If your doctor decides you need it, he or she might recommend injections of vitamin B12 or supplements. Other supplements are sometimes used as treatments for nerve pain. There's some preliminary evidence that a few of them -- like acetyl- L-carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, and gamma linolenic acid -- might help with nerve pain caused by diabetes. However, the evidence isn't clear; more research needs to be done. Always check with a doctor before you start taking a supplement regularly. Your nonprescription options include more than over-the-counter medicines. Here are some other treatments that you could try for your nerve pain. Acupuncture. This traditional Chinese approach has proven helpful for many kinds of pain. Researchers speculate that acupuncture might release chemicals that numb pain, or that that it blocks the pain signals sent from the nerves. In studies of acupuncture on nerve pain specifically, results have been mixed. But given that it has few side effects, you could try it to see whether it works for you. Physical therapy. Nerve damage can lead to muscle weakness and wasting. Working with a physical therapist can help reverse that -- and might help reduce pain in the process. Massage. While the evidence that massage helps with chronic pain isn't clear, it has few risks. Some people find that it can be especially helpful with painful muscle spasms. Assistive devices. The nerve damage that causes pain can also result in muscle weakness. You might find that using assistive devices -- like canes or splints -- can make it easier to move around and reduce pain. Depending on your case, ergonomically designed chairs or desks could also bring relief. Biofeedback. This technique teaches you how to control bodily functions that are normally involuntary -- like heart rate and blood pressure. With practice, you can learn how to relax your muscles and reduce tension, which may help relieve pain. Hypnosis. There's some evidence that hypnosis can help with various types of chronic pain. Relaxation. Look into stress management techniques. Or try other approaches -- like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing -- that will help you relax. Not only will these approaches relieve some of the stress caused by life with chronic nerve pain, but they may help with the pain itself. Talk therapy. This might seem an odd treatment for nerve pain. But life with chronic pain can make people depressed -- and depression can make the feeling of pain more intense. Chronic pain can also lead to conflict with people at home and at work. A therapist can help you grapple with some of these issues and figure out ways to resolve them -- and help you come up with ways to stick to your treatment plan. Ask your doctor for a referral to a psychologist or a social worker. While making changes to your lifestyle is unlikely to eliminate your nerve pain, it might help -- especially when combined with other treatment. Here are some suggestions. Eat a good diet. There's no special eating plan for nerve pain. But a well-balanced diet -- with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains -- help to ensure that you're getting the nutrients you need. Your doctor might also recommend reducing the amount of alcohol you drink -- or cutting it out entirely. Get regular exercise. Many studies have shown that people with chronic pain who exercise feel less pain, have more energy, and have improved mood than those who don't. Don't smoke. In addition to all of its other bad effects, smoking can reduce the blood supply to the nerves and worsen nerve pain. If you smoke, you need to quit. In some cases, sensible changes to your lifestyle have an additional benefit. They might also help treat the underlying cause of your nerve pain -- particularly with diseases like diabetes. If you're in constant pain, don't suffer and muddle through. Instead, get help from a doctor -- preferably an expert in treating nerve pain, like a neurologist or a pain management specialist. Together, you can come up with a treatment plan that will help you feel better.""]",What are non prescription treatments that I could try for nerve pain?,"For nerve pain, non-prescription treatments include over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen [92m[0][0m.

It’s caused by many of the same viruses and bacteria that cause sore throats. If you have frequent bouts of tonsillitis or strep throat, you may need surgery (called a tonsillectomy) to have your tonsils removed. The best way to protect yourself from the germs that cause these infections is to wash your hands often. Try to steer clear of people who have colds or other contagious infections.

However, a sore throat from a cold often gets better or goes away after the first day or two. Other cold symptoms such as a runny nose and congestion may follow the sore throat. Strep throat, which is an infection due to streptococcus bacteria, is another cause of sore throats and tonsillitis. With strep throat, the sore throat is often more severe and persists. Tonsillitis is a painful inflammation or infection of the tonsils, the tissue masses located at the back of the throat. Sore throats can be caused by viruses or bacteria. The most common causes of sore throats are viruses. Viral sore throats are often accompanied by other cold symptoms that may include a runny nose, cough, red or watery eyes, and sneezing. Other causes of sore throat include smoking, pollution or irritants in the air, allergies, and dry air. In addition to a sore throat, other common cold symptoms include: Runny nose Sneezing Cough Mild headache Mild body aches Fever Although there is no cure for a sore throat caused by a cold virus, there are ways to help you feel more comfortable. Drinking warm liquids, gargling with warm salt water, sucking on ice chips, or taking an over-the-counter medicine may relieve symptoms of pain or fever. When you are sick with a cold, it is also important to get enough rest, eat a healthy diet, and drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter cold medications may relieve cold and sore throat symptoms. However, the benefits of these drugs are minimal. Some cold medications include: Pain relievers, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen and naproxen, to relieve the aches and pains of a cold and sore throat. ( Aspirin should not be given to children because of its link to Reye's syndrome, a disorder that can cause brain damage and death.) Sore throat sprays and lozenges to soothe your throat and numb the throat pain temporarily. ( Lozenges should not be given to young children.) Decongestant nasal sprays to relieve a sore throat caused by postnasal drip -- nasal drainage that runs down your throat. ( Be sure to stop using nasal decongestant sprays after three days, or you may have an increase in congestion when you stop them.) Antibiotics should not be used to treat a cold virus and sore throat. Antibiotics are effective only against bacteria. They will not work on sore throats associated with colds, which are caused by viruses. \x1b[92m[10] Strep throat is caused by an infection of streptococcus bacteria.\x1b[0m Strep throat spreads by having contact with an infected person's saliva or nasal secretions. Although strep throat is more common in children ages 5 to 15, it also occurs in adults. To diagnose strep throat, your doctor can check a rapid strep test or send a throat swab to the lab for a culture. In some cases, he or she may be able to diagnose strep based on your reported symptoms and other signs, such as white spots in the throat area, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Strep throat can cause more serious illnesses, such as rheumatic fever, a disease that may harm the heart valves. \x1b[92m[0] That's why it's important to get proper medical treatment.\x1b[0m With proper treatment, strep throat is usually cured within 10 days. Strep throat symptoms are usually more severe than symptoms of a sore throat with a cold and may include the following: Sudden sore throat Loss of appetite Painful swallowing Red tonsils with white spots Fever The symptoms of a cold and strep throat can be very similar. \x1b[92m[3] If you think you have symptoms of strep throat, visit your health care provider.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[4] Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and do a physical exam, and you may be given a strep test.\x1b[0m A rapid strep test checks for streptococcus bacteria infection in the throat. The test is painless and takes very little time. The tip of a cotton swab is used to wipe the back of the throat. The swab is then tested right away. If the strep test is positive, you have strep throat. If the strep test is negative, you likely do not have strep throat. However, if there are strong signs of strep throat, your health care provider can do a different throat swab test that is sent to the lab to see if strep bacteria can be grown (cultured) from it. A throat culture takes a couple of days for results. \x1b[92m[7] Strep throat is treated using antibiotics, which kill the bacteria causing the infection.\x1b[0m Antibiotics are often taken as pills or given as a shot. Penicillin and amoxicillin are common antibiotics used to treat strep throat. Other antibiotics are prescribed for people who are allergic to penicillin. Follow your health care provider's instructions for antibiotic use. Take all of the medication, even if you feel better. You should feel better within a day or two. A person with strep throat should stay home until 24 hours after starting the antibiotic. If your strep throat is not getting better, let your health care provider know right away. Do not stop taking your prescribedmedicine unless your health care provider tells you to. Call your health care provider if these symptoms occur: Fever one or two days after feeling better Nausea or vomiting Earache Headache Neck stiffness Skin rash Cough Swollen glands Painful joints Shortness of breath Dark urine, rash, or chest pain (may occur three to four weeks later) Sometimes, a sore throat is caused by tonsillitis, an inflammation of the tonsils. Tonsillitis can be caused by viruses or bacteria. While the tonsils' job is to help fight infection, the tonsils can also become infected. When they do, the result is tonsillitis and a very painful sore throat. In addition to a sore throat, a cold usually causes nasal symptoms, such as runny nose or congestion. With tonsillitis, your tonsils become swollen and may have telltale white or yellow spots. \x1b[92m[6] Other symptoms with tonsillitis include the following: Bad breath Fever Voice changes because of swelling Painful swallowing Swollen lymph glands in neck If the tonsillitis infection is bacterial like strep throat, then antibiotics are given.\x1b[0m If the tonsillitis infection is viral, antibiotics will not help. The virus must run its course for the sore throat to resolve. For either type of throat infection, the following treatment measures may help: Getting plenty of rest Drinking lots of fluid Eating smooth, soothing foods like gelatin, ice cream, shakes, frozen desserts, and soup Avoiding crunchy or spicy foods Using a vaporizer Taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen, naproxen, or ibuprofen. Children should not take aspirin. If the tonsillitis infections occur repeatedly, or if the tonsils are interfering with sleep and breathing, the doctor may recommend a tonsillectomy, which is the surgical removal of the tonsils.""]",Do I need to see my doctor if I think I have strep throat?,"Yes, if you suspect you have strep throat, it's important to see your doctor [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m.

So, almost all cases of DCIS are treated. \x1b[92m[6] In women with estrogen receptor-positive DCIS who have a lumpectomy plus radiation therapy, tamoxifen may lower the risk of: DCIS recurrence (a return of DCIS) Invasive breast cancer\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/medguide.cfm?setid=1bb81dd5-8d4e-4d6d-b030-a8ff2a3d4f55\nThis Medication Guide reviews the risks and benefits of using tamoxifen citrate tablets to reduce the chance of getting breast cancer in high-risk women and women with DCIS. This guide does not discuss the special benefits and decisions for people who already have breast cancer. Why do women and men use tamoxifen citrate tablets? Tamoxifen citrate tablets have more than one use. \x1b[92m[4] Tamoxifen citrate tablets are used: 1. to lower the chance of getting breast cancer in women with a higher than normal chance of getting breast cancer in the next 5 years (high-risk women) 2. to lower the chance of getting invasive (spreading) breast cancer in women who had surgery and radiation for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\x1b[0m DCIS means the cancer is only inside the milk ducts. 3.

Oral tamoxifen has been shown to have beneficial effects in women with DCIS, but, as with the other study, concern about toxic effects has led to limited uptake of the treatment. Researchers in this study wanted to see if giving tamoxifen through a transdermal (topical) gel might be as effective as the oral medication but have fewer side effects, because providing the medication through the skin avoids the systemic exposure that comes with an oral drug. The findings were published in JAMA Surgery. ', 'https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/treatment/hormone-therapy-for-breast-cancer.html\nAbout 2 out of 3 breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive. Their cells have receptors (proteins) for estrogen (ER-positive cancers) and/or progesterone (PR-positive cancers) which help the cancer cells grow and spread. There are several types of hormone therapy for breast cancer. Most types of hormone therapy either lower estrogen levels in the body or stop estrogen from helping breast cancer cells grow. \x1b[92m[11] Drugs that block estrogen receptors These drugs work by stopping estrogen from fueling breast cancer cells to grow.\x1b[0m Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) These drugs block estrogen from connecting to the cancer cells and telling them to grow and divide. While they have anti-estrogen effects in breast cells, they act like an estrogen in other tissues, like the uterus and the bones. These drugs are pills, taken by mouth. Tamoxifen\ufeff Tamoxifen can be used to treat women with breast cancer who have or have not gone through menopause. This drug can be used in several ways: ', 'https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/understanding-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ\nDCIS research is directed mainly at improving treatment and, above all, at preventing progression to invasive disease. As researchers continue to study the pathology of DCIS, they are finding that certain tumor characteristics help predict the treatment most likely to reduce the chance of recurrence. For example, some forms of breast cancer require estrogen in order to grow; tumors that do are termed estrogen receptor–positive (ER-positive). \x1b[92m[10] Tamoxifen belongs to a class of drugs called selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), which act by blocking estrogen receptors.\x1b[0m Tamoxifen is more likely to prevent a recurrence in women with ER-positive DCIS than in women with ER-negative disease. ', 'https://stopcancerfund.org/p-breast-cancer/hormonal-therapy-ductal-carcinoma-situ-dcis/\n\x1b[92m[8] Tamoxifen blocks the effects of estrogen on breast cells, which can stop the growth of cancer cells that are sensitive to estrogen.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[7] A study of more than 1,800 pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women with DCIS evaluated the benefits of tamoxifen for women who had lumpectomy and radiation treatment.\x1b[0m These women were randomly assigned to take tamoxifen for 5 years or a placebo (sugar pill). The study found that after 5 years, women who took tamoxifen were about 5% less likely to develop either DCIS or cancer in the same breast, cancer in the opposite breast, or distant cancer spread (8.2% in women taking tamoxifen vs. 13.4% in placebo). However, the vast majority of women survived and they did not live any longer whether they took tamoxifen or not.[1] ', ""https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/hormone-therapy-overview\nHormones that every woman has in her body -- estrogen and progesterone -- can be fuel for some types of breast cancer. They help the cells grow and spread. Hormone therapy, also called endocrine therapy, adds, blocks, or removes those chemicals to treat the disease. There are two types of hormone therapy for breast cancer: Drugs that stop estrogen and progesterone from helping breast cancer cells grow Drugs or surgery to keep the ovaries from making the hormones Hormone therapy is different from hormone replacement therapy ( HRT), a treatment that adds hormones to the body to counter the effects of menopause. When you're diagnosed with breast cancer, your doctor will test cells from your tumor to see if they have parts on their surfaces called receptors that use estrogen or progesterone. If they do, it means that they depend on these hormones to grow. In that case, your doctor will probably recommend hormone therapy as part of your treatment plan. If you've already been treated for breast cancer, you might use hormone therapy to help keep it from coming back. It also helps lower your odds of getting new cancers in the other breast. Also, if you don't have the disease but have a family history of it, or genes that raise your risk, your doctor may recommend hormone therapy to lower your chances of getting it. Common hormone therapy drugs for breast cancer treatment include: Anastrozole ( Arimidex) Exemestane ( Aromasin) Fulvestrant ( Faslodex) Goserelin ( Zoladex) Letrozole ( Femara) Leuprorelin, leuprolide acetate ( Lupron) Megestrol ( Megace) Tamoxifen ( Nolvadex, Soltamox) Toremifene ( Fareston) Tamoxifen is a pill that doctors have prescribed for more than 30 years to treat breast cancer. \x1b[92m[9] It works by keeping estrogen from attaching to the cancer cells.\x1b[0m Doctors first used tamoxifen to treat women whose breast cancer had spread in their bodies because it slowed or stopped the growth of the disease. The drug also lowers the chance that some early stage breast cancers will come back. And it can lower the risk that a woman will get cancer in her other breast later on. Women who are at high risk for breast cancer can take tamoxifen to try to lower their chances of getting the disease. It's an alternative to watchful waiting or having surgery to remove a breast, called a mastectomy, before they get the disease. \x1b[92m[3] Tamoxifen is an option for: Treatment of the earliest form of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS), along with surgery Treatment of abnormal cells in the glands that make milk, called lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS), to lessen the chance that they'll become more advanced breast cancer Treatment of breast cancer in men and women whose cancers use estrogen Treatment of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or that comes back after treatment To prevent breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease Some people should not use tamoxifen: Pregnant women Women planning to get pregnant Men or women who've had blood clots or a stroke Talk to your doctor to see if tamoxifen is right for you.\x1b[0m For women, the side effects of tamoxifen are similar to some of the symptoms of menopause. Two of the most common ones are hot flashes and vaginal discharge. Other problems for women may include: Vaginal dryness or itching Irregular periods Headache Nausea and vomiting Skin rash Fatigue Water retention and weight gain The side effects may be similar to menopause, but tamoxifen doesn't trigger menopause. For men, tamoxifen can cause: Headache Nausea and vomiting Skin rash Sexual side effects like erectile dysfunction or a lower sex drive Yes. The risks include: Fertility. Tamoxifen can increase your fertility for a short time. But it might harm a growing baby, so it's important to use some form of barrier birth control while you're taking it, like condoms or a diaphragm. Don't use birth control pills. They can change how the drug works and affect the breast cancer. Tell your doctor right away if you think you've become pregnant while you're taking tamoxifen. Blood clots. Women who take tamoxifen may have a slightly higher risk of blood clots in their lungs or large veins. It's an even bigger risk for smokers. Stroke. Uterine cancer or sarcoma. The drug may make a woman more likely to get these diseases. But this risk is small, and it may be outweighed by the benefits of tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment.

People have also reported eye problems such as corneal scarring or retinal changes. Medications. Tamoxifen may affect how other drugs work in your body. A large study by the National Cancer Institute looked at whether tamoxifen lowered cases of breast cancer in healthy women who were known to be likely to get the disease. The results of the trial showed a 50% reduction in breast cancer in the women who took the drug. \x1b[92m[1] Studies have also shown that tamoxifen lessens the risk of breast cancer returning in women who have had the earliest form of the disease, ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS).\x1b[0m Another drug, raloxifene ( Evista), which prevents the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis, is similar to tamoxifen. Studies have found that it prevents breast cancer in women who are at high risk, but with fewer side effects. The FDA has approved it for breast cancer prevention. Aromatase inhibitors: This type of hormone therapy drug keeps your body from breaking down testosterone into estrogen. They include: Anastrozole ( Arimidex) Exemestane ( Aromasin) Letrozole ( Femara) Aromatase inhibitors keep breast cancer from getting worse for longer than tamoxifen in women who have the advanced disease whose tumors rely on estrogen to grow. For women who have gone through menopause, the drugs can fight cancer even after it has spread to other parts of the body. They are pills that you take once a day. Side effects of aromatase inhibitors include: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea and constipation Hot flashes Headache Bone pain Severe fatigue Skin rash Swelling and water retention Flu-like symptoms Increased bone loss Fulvestrant ( Faslodex): This shot keeps estrogen from attaching to cancer cells.

These spores proliferate quickly and can take hold in places with poor ventilation and high humidity in less than 24 hours. The problem starts when you inhale these spores.

That means that if you can keep the interior of your home dry, you can avoid having any problems with mold. \x1b[92m[13] The best way to prevent mold in your home is to clean up spills, repair leaks in your roof, plumbing or HVAC system and make sure your kitchen and bathroom are properly venting moisture out of the house.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[14] There are two major reasons to clean up and remove any mold growing in your house: mold damages the surface it is growing on and mold may aggravate allergies or asthma.\x1b[0m ', 'https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/mold\nEmailSMS/Text Message Email Address Mold Information SlideShow Mold Basics The key to mold control is moisture control. \x1b[92m[12] If mold is a problem in your home, you should clean up the mold promptly and fix the water problem.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] It is important to dry water-damaged areas and items within 24-48 hours to prevent mold growth.\x1b[0m Molds gradually destroy the things they grow on. \x1b[92m[10] You can prevent damage to your home and furnishings, save money, and avoid potential health problems by controlling moisture and eliminating mold growth.\x1b[0m Learn More about the basics of Mold Molds are Part of the Natural Environment Outdoors, molds play a part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter, such as fallen leaves and dead trees, but indoors, mold growth should be avoided. Molds reproduce by means of tiny spores; the spores are invisible to the naked eye and float through outdoor and indoor air. ', ""https://www.webmd.com/women/mold-mildew\nWhether it's the slimy black spots on your shower curtain, the fuzzy white patches on your basement floor, or the slick orange film that forms on your kitchen drain, household mold is more than unsightly. In some cases, mold in your home can make you sick, especially if you have allergies or asthma. Whether or not you're allergic to molds, mold exposure can irritate your eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs. Here's what you can do to combat mold problems, and take care of yourself and your home. For people sensitive to mold, inhaling or touching mold spores can cause allergic reactions, including sneezing, runny nose, red eyes, and skin rash. People with serious mold allergies may have more severe reactions, including shortness of breath. In people with asthma who are allergic to mold, breathing in spores can also cause asthma attacks. \x1b[92m[2] In addition to people with allergies and asthma, others who may be more sensitive to the effects of mold include: Infants and children The elderly People whose immune systems are compromised due to HIV infection, cancer, liver disease, or chemotherapy People with chronic lung disease Mold is a type of fungus that consists of small organisms found almost everywhere.\x1b[0m They can be black, white, orange, green, or purple. Outdoors, molds play an important role in nature, breaking down dead leaves, plants, and trees. Molds thrive on moisture and reproduce by means of tiny, lightweight spores that travel through the air. You're exposed to mold every day. In small amounts, mold spores are usually harmless, but when they land on a damp spot in your home, they can start to grow. When mold is growing on a surface, spores can be released into the air where they can be easily inhaled. If you're sensitive to mold and inhale a large number of spores, you could experience health problems. Your walls, floors, appliances, carpet, or furniture â   they can all provide the food mold needs to grow. But the thing all molds need most is moisture, so you're most likely to see mold in damp places such as bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, basements, and crawl spaces. \x1b[92m[8] It's impossible to get rid of all mold and mold spores in your home, but because mold spores can't grow without moisture, reducing moisture in your home is the best way to prevent or eliminate mold growth.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[9] If there is already mold growing in your home, it's important to clean up the mold and fix the problem causing dampness.\x1b[0m If you clean up the mold but don't fix the problem, the mold will most likely return. Following is some advice for reducing moisture throughout the home with specific tips for the areas most prone to dampness and mold growth: Around the house: Use dehumidifiers and air conditioners, especially in hot, humid climates, to reduce moisture in the air. Keep indoor humidity below 60% if possible. You can measure relative humidity with a hygrometer, an inexpensive instrument available at many hardware stores. Keep air conditioning drip pans clean. Make sure drain lines are free of obstructions and flow properly. Keep the house warm in cool weather. As the temperature goes down, the air is less able to hold moisture and it condenses on cold surfaces, which can encourage mold growth. Add insulation to cold surfaces, such as exterior walls, floors, and windows to reduce condensation. Dry wet areas within 24 to 48 hours to prevent mold growth. Fix leaks and seepage. The ground should slope away from your house. If water is entering the house from the outside, your options range from simple landscaping to extensive excavation and waterproofing. Have a heating and cooling contractor check your heating and cooling system to make sure it's sized and operating properly to remove humidity. If your system is too big or the airflow is incorrect, your air conditioner will not remove humidity like it should. Also, ask the contractor to check your duct system for air leaks, and proper size and air flow to each room. Open doors between rooms to increase circulation, which carries heat to cold surfaces. Increase air circulation by using fans and by moving furniture from wall corners. In the kitchen: Use exhaust fans to move moisture outside (not into the attic) whenever you are cooking, washing dishes, or cleaning. Turn off certain appliances if you notice moisture on windows and other surfaces. Check for leaks around the kitchen sink, refrigerator ice makers, and other sources of water. Repair if necessary. Empty and clean refrigerator drip pans if necessary. In basements and crawl spaces: Put a plastic cover over dirt in crawl spaces to prevent moisture from coming in from the ground. If there is standing water or the soil is wet, dry it out with fans before covering the floor. Be sure crawl spaces are well ventilated by using fans and having vents installed in outside walls if necessary. Consider painting concrete floors and using area rugs instead of wall-to-wall carpet in basements. If you plan to install carpet over a concrete floor, it may be necessary to use a vapor barrier (plastic sheeting) over the concrete and cover that with sub-flooring (insulation covered with plywood) to prevent a moisture problem. Have your basement floor checked for leaks and have them repaired if necessary. Water can enter your home by leaking or by seeping through basement floors or walls. Make sure gutters are working properly and that outdoor landscaping causes water to run away from -- not toward -- the house. Do not finish basement walls with insulation and wall board unless your basement is very dry. In the laundry room: Vent your clothes dryer to the outside. Make sure the vent is clear of obstructions, such as lint, and that there are no holes that leak air. If the vent duct is damaged, replace it with a metal duct. Have the duct cleaned at least once a year. Avoid leaving damp clothes in the laundry basket or dryer. Wash and dry them promptly. In bathrooms: Use exhaust fans to remove moisture to the outside (not into the attic). Use area rugs, which can be taken up and washed often instead of wall-to-wall carpeting. Check for leaks around basins and tubs and have them repaired if necessary. Open a window when showering. Avoid leaving damp towels on the floor or in laundry hamper.""]",What should you know about mold problems?,"Mold problems are critical to address due to their potential health risks, including allergies and respiratory issues [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.

To do that, your doctor may consider these types of prescription drugs. Anticonvulsants. These are medicines that prevent or reduce seizures. Your doctor may recommend topiramate ( Qudexy XR, Topamax) or valproic acid ( Depakene, Depakote) to prevent your headaches. Beta-blockers. These relax your blood vessels. Your doctor may suggest metoprolol ( Lopressor, Toprol XL) or propranolol ( Inderal, Innopran XL). Botulinum toxin ( Botox). A doctor can inject small amounts around your face and scalp every 3 months to stop migraines from happening. Calcium-channel blockers. These include diltiazem ( Cardizem, Cartia, Covera HS, Tiazac) and verapamil ( Calan, Verelan). They ease the narrowing of your blood vessels. Antidepressants . Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline ( Aventyl) or nortriptyline ( Pamelor). Research suggests duloxetine ( Cymbalta) and venlafaxine ( Effexor XR) may be helpful in preventing migraines. CGRP Inhibitors. CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a molecule involved in causing migraine pain. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of drugs that block the effects of CGRP. Erenumab ( Aimovig) and fremanezumab ( Ajovy) are specifically approved to prevent migraine attacks. You give yourself an injection once a month with a pen-like device. \x1b[92m[0] You may want to consider medicine to prevent migraines if you: Have pain that hampers your life despite treatment Get at more than three moderate to severe headaches per month Take a lot of painkillers Don't get enough relief from meds you now take Have side effects from your headache drugs Have uncommon migraine conditions like continuing aura (blurred vision or seeing spots or wavy lines) Preventive medicine might not be right for you if: Your headaches are infrequent and controlled by anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and naproxen.\x1b[0m Other health conditions keep you from taking preventive drugs. Those drugs could mix badly with other medicines you take. You prefer treatments that don't involve meds. If you can't take medication or prefer not to, there's also a device you and your doctor could consider. It's called Cefaly, and it's the first FDA-approved machine that prevents migraine in people over 18. It's a portable headband-like device that you wear around your forehead. It gives out electrical impulses that stimulate a nerve connected with migraines. You'll feel a tingling sensation and should use it once a day for 20 minutes. Your headaches may ease up during your second and third trimesters. If you have severe migraines, your doctor may suggest that you first try a treatment that's not a drug -- such as biofeedback, relaxation therapy, or stress management training.

When your immune system recognizes an antigen, it attacks it. This is called an immune response. Part of this response is to make antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that work to attack, weaken, and destroy antigens. Your body also makes other cells to fight the antigen.

They carry a clear fluid called lymph, which contains tissue fluid, waste products and immune system cells. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped clumps of immune system cells that are connected by lymphatic vessels. They contain white blood cells that trap viruses, bacteria and other invaders, including cancer cells. White blood cells are the cells of the immune system. They are made in your child’s bone marrow, which is one of the lymph organs. Other lymph organs include the spleen and thymus. When your child’s immune system doesn't work the way it should, it is called an immune system disorder or immunodeficiency. Your child may: Be born with a weak immune system. This is called primary immune deficiency.

', ""https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/shoulder-replacement-surgery-what-to-know\nIf your shoulder joint gets seriously damaged, you might need surgery to replace it. Before you have your procedure, you should know some things. The joint where your upper arm connects to your body is a ball-and-socket joint. The bone in your upper arm, called the humerus, has a round end that fits into the curved structure on the outside of your shoulder blade. Ligaments and tendons hold it together. Ligaments connect the bones, while tendons connect muscles to the bone. A layer of tissue called cartilage keeps the bones apart, so they don't rub against each other. The ball and socket lets you move your arm up and down, back and forward, or in a circle. You may have to have it done if you have a condition that makes it painful and hard to use your arm, such as: A serious shoulder injury like a broken bone Severe arthritis A torn rotator cuff Your doctor will probably try to treat you with drugs or physical therapy first. If those don't work, he may recommend surgery. Shoulder replacement surgery is less common than hip or knee replacements. But more than 50,000 shoulder replacements are done in the U. S. each year. An orthopedic surgeon will replace the natural bone in the ball and socket of your shoulder joint with a material that could be metal or plastic. It's a major surgery that'll keep you in the hospital for several days. You'll also need several weeks of physical therapy afterward. There are three types of shoulder replacement surgeries: Total shoulder replacement: This is the most common type. It replaces the ball at the top of your humerus with a metal ball, which gets attached to the remaining bone. The socket gets covered with a new plastic surface. Partial shoulder replacement: Only the ball gets replaced. Reverse shoulder replacement: Usually, you'd get this if you have a torn rotator cuff. It's also done when another shoulder replacement surgery didn't work. The metal ball gets attached to your shoulder bones, and a socket is implanted at the top of your arm. \x1b[92m[2] Before you get your new shoulder, you'll likely get a full physical exam and X-rays or other imaging tests so the surgeon can get a look at the joint.\x1b[0m Talk to your doctor about any other conditions you have and any medications you take. You'll have to stop taking certain drugs, especially narcotic painkillers, several weeks before surgery. You may have to cut back on drinking and get more exercise, too. If you smoke, you'll be asked to quit. Scientists have found folks who smoke are more likely to have complications from joint replacement surgery than those who don't. Don't eat or drink anything after midnight on the night before your operation. The procedure takes about 3 hours. Doctors will give you drugs to put you under during the surgery. You'll want to be sure you have some help with your daily routine lined up for a few weeks after you come home from the hospital. You won't be able to move your arm very much. If you don't have a relative or friend who can help you out, you might want to check into a rehabilitation center until you can do more things on your own. You may also want to move some things around at home to make them easier to get to while you recover. You can expect to spend 2 to 5 days in the hospital after your operation before going home. Your shoulder will swell, and it will hurt. Your doctor will prescribe drugs to help you manage the pain. Cold compresses can help control the swelling. At first, your arm will be in a brace to keep it from moving. Within a day or so, you'll start physical therapy to get your arm and your new shoulder working. You'll keep doing physical therapy after you go home. You'll do exercises that will gradually improve how your new joint works. Don't rush things: It may take 4 weeks before you can pick up anything heavier than a glass of water. Your arm will be in a sling for most of your recovery. It may be 6 weeks or more before you can drive again. In the year after your surgery, you'll have several follow-up visits with your doctor so she can see how your recovery is going. Most people have full motion in their shoulder and return to their daily routine after joint replacement surgery. But as with any operation, there's a chance of complications. These may include: Infection or bleeding around the joint: You'll probably get antibiotics after your surgery to lower your chances of an infection. Dislocation: This happens when the ball slips out of the socket. Nerves around your shoulder may get damaged during surgery: They usually recover. After years of use, the replacement joint may become loose or separate from the bone: You may need surgery to fix it.""]",How should you prepare for shoulder replacement surgery?,"To prepare for shoulder replacement surgery, it's crucial to consult with your surgeon about the procedure, risks, and recovery expectations [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m.

If you have pseudobulbar affect you'll experience emotions normally, but you'll sometimes express them in an exaggerated or inappropriate way. As a result, the condition can be embarrassing and disruptive to your daily life. Pseudobulbar affect often goes undiagnosed or is mistaken for mood disorders.

"", ""https://www.bcm.edu/healthcare/specialties/neurology/neuropsychology/pseudobulbar-affect\n\x1b[92m[1] Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is involuntary and uncontrollable episodes of either laughing or crying that seem inappropriate in the social situation.\x1b[0m PBA can cause a great deal of distress in social situations, in the work place, and with family. The emotion is often triggered by something only slightly funny or sad. For example, a sad TV commercial may trigger uncontrollable crying. The emotion may also be the opposite emotion that the person is feeling. For example, a fit of uncontrollable laughter may be triggered by feelings of intense anger. Heading Prevalence Content Between 43 and 49 percent of individuals with ALS exhibit PBA. PBA is also found in individuals with stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Heading Treatment Options Heading Pharmacological Content "", ""https://www.beaconhealthsystem.org/library/diseases-and-conditions/pseudobulbar-affect?content_id=CON-20192124\nThe degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes.

Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect.

Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing. The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes.

The way it works in the brain to treat PBA is not known. Quinidine is in a class of medications called antiarrhythmics. When combined with dextromethorphan, quinidine works by increasing the amount of dextromethorphan in the body.How should this medicine be used?

In other words, you may feel happy but start crying and not be able to stop. Or you could feel sad but start to laugh when you shouldn\'t. You might just cry or laugh a lot. Some people say the symptoms come on so quickly it\'s like a seizure. It\'s easy to mistake the symptoms for those of depression or bipolar disorder. If you have PBA, you might get anxious or embarrassed in public. You might worry about a future episode and be tempted to cancel plans with friends or family. It can also lead to depression or anxiety. If you\'re caring for someone who has it, you might feel confused or frustrated. The emotional toll of the condition can greatly affect recovery and quality of life. It\'s important to seek care and treatment from a qualified doctor. Scientists believe that pseudobulbar affect may result from damage to the prefrontal cortex, the area of your brain that helps control emotions. Damage to other parts of the brain as well as changes in brain chemicals linked to depression and hyper moods (mania) could also play a role. An injury or disease that affects your brain can lead to pseudobulbar affect. Other brain conditions commonly linked to PBA include: Alzheimer\'s disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) Brain tumor Dementia Multiple sclerosis Parkinson\'s disease Traumatic brain injury If you or someone you love is crying or laughing a lot and you don\'t know why, talk to a doctor. PBA is hard to diagnose because it mimics other problems like depression or other mood disorders. Tell the doctor about any symptoms, including when they happen and how long they last. It can help to keep a diary of crying and laughing episodes. Your doctor won\'t need to do tests to diagnose PBA. But to rule out a form of epilepsy that can cause similar symptoms, they might order an electroencephalogram ( EEG), a painless test that tracks your brain waves. Two questionnaires help to tell if the laughing and weeping are signs of PBA: Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale ( PLACS): The doctor asks you questions about the episodes, including how long they lasted, how they were tied to your mood and social situation, and how upset you felt afterward. Center for Neurologic Study- Lability Scale ( CNS- LS): You answer questions about your symptoms. How often do you have them? How do they make you feel? For example, "" I find myself crying very easily"" or "" I\'m easily overcome with laughter."" Doctors might prescribe antidepressants to control symptoms of pseudobulbar affect. In 2010, the FDA approved dextromethorphan/quinidine ( Nuedexta), the first drug for PBA. Studies show it helps control outbursts of crying and laughing in people with MS and ALS. To help you and your loved ones ease anxiety during a PBA episode, and to feel more in control of your health, try these steps: Talk to people around you about PBA and how it affects you and your family. This will help keep them from being surprised or confused when an episode happens. Track your episodes in a diary, including what set them off and how long they lasted. This will help when you talk to your doctor about possible treatments. Talk with other people who have PBA. They understand what it\'s like and might have other tips that might help you. Shift position. \x1b[92m[4] If you feel a laughing or crying attack coming on, change how you\'re sitting or standing.\x1b[0m Breathe slowly and deeply.

'These two things go a long way in helping to build a strong core, which is key to minimizing pain in the lower back.' \x1b[92m[2] To prevent back pain and improve your daily habits, you may: Achieve and maintain a healthy weight Avoid carrying too-heavy loads and bend with your knees when you lift heavy items Eat a nutrient-rich diet with enough calcium, vitamin D and phosphorus to build healthy bones Exercise consistently, incorporating both stretching and core strengthening exercises Ensure you use an ergonomic workstation that supports correct posture Sleep on your side, or use a supportive pillow under your abdomen or knees if you sleep on your stomach or back\x1b[0m "", ""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/back-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20369906\nPsychological conditions. People prone to depression and anxiety appear to have a greater risk of back pain. Stress can cause muscle tension, which can contribute to back pain. Smoking. Smokers have increased rates of back pain. This may occur because smoking causes coughing, which can lead to herniated disks. Smoking also can decrease blood flow to the spine and increase the risk of osteoporosis. PreventionImproving one's physical condition and learning and practicing how to use the body might help prevent back pain. To keep the back healthy and strong: Exercise. \x1b[92m[3] Regular low-impact aerobic activities — those that don't strain or jolt the back — can increase strength and endurance in the back and allow the muscles to work better.\x1b[0m Walking, bicycling and swimming are good choices. Talk with your health care provider about which activities to try. "", ""https://www.tdi.texas.gov/tips/safety/backinjury.html\nSlouching and other awkward postures can strain your back. \x1b[92m[4] Whether you sit or stand at work, reduce stress on the back by remaining in a neutral, 'S' curve back posture.\x1b[0m You may need to change the height of your workstation. Adjust your chair so your feet rest flat on the floor or on a footrest. Your thighs should be parallel to the floor. You can also prevent extra pressure on the lower back by removing your wallet or cellphone from your back pocket while sitting. 2 Lift properly. When lifting something heavy, get close to the object, bend your knees, tighten your stomach muscles, and let your legs support your body as you stand. Keep the object close to your body and do not twist as you stand. If the object is too heavy, ask someone for help or use a lifting device. 3 Reduce repetitive tasks. "", 'https://www.tdi.texas.gov/tips/safety/backinjury.html\nRepeating certain movements, like twisting or rotating your spine, can injure your back. Try to switch between physically demanding tasks and easier ones. If you work at a computer, make sure the monitor, keyboard, mouse, and chair are positioned correctly. 4 Avoid inactivity. Inactivity can result in back pain, especially if you sit for hours in a chair with poor back support. If you must sit for a long time, change your position often. Walk around or stretch your muscles every 20 to 30 minutes. 5 Keep a healthy lifestyle. Aging, obesity, and poor physical condition can also contribute to back pain. \x1b[92m[0] Maintain your weight, eat healthy, and get regular exercise to strengthen your back muscles and abdomen, and examine your work environment to help prevent injury and pain.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/back-pain/diagnosis-treatment-and-steps-to-take\nPrevention of Back PainYou may be able to prevent back pain from overuse or improper body mechanics. \x1b[92m[1] The following recommendations can help you have a healthy back and lifestyle:Perform regular exercise that keeps your back muscles strong.\x1b[0m Exercises that increase balance and strength can decrease your risk of falling and injuring your back or breaking bones.

In order to prove a correlation between foods and acne, we need a better understanding of how they’re linked. For example, think about how gasoline affects a car. We know that when you get in the car, it doesn’t just go. There’s more to it. We put gasoline in the car, it powers the engine, which turns the wheels, and the car moves. With acne, we’re still building our knowledge of how it works. Sure, people notice that putting certain foods in their body changes their acne, but we don’t know the full mechanism yet. To complicate it further, the results aren’t consistent. \x1b[92m[7] Some people see a change in their acne when they add or eliminate certain foods in their diet, while others follow the same diet and don’t notice any difference.\x1b[0m Caffeine and Acne ', ""https://facefitnessltd.com/acne-and-diet-can-what-you-eat-cause-acne-williamsville-clarence-buffalo-ny-clear-skin-diet-for-acne/\n\x1b[92m[0] Researchers have been investigating possible links between diet and acne for many years.\x1b[0m When looking at native people in Papua New Guinea and Paraguay, they do not get acne. Their diet consists of low glycemic index (GI) foods and no dairy. The 'Western American diet' – high GI carbs, dairy, fat and sugar – has been seen as a possible culprit for acne outbreaks or increased severity. Acne And The Glycemic Index Put simply, the glycemic index is a number that tells you approximately how fast your body will convert a carb into glucose, or sugar. The smaller the number, the lower the impact a specific food has on your blood sugar and insulin levels. When blood sugar levels rise, the resulting production of hormones tells your sebaceous glands to produce more oil. More oil in the skin inevitably leads to an increase in breakouts if you’re prone to acne.

Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it\'s important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin\'s surface. Washing more often than twice daily is not necessarily better; it may do more harm than good. Use warm, not hot, water and a mild facial cleanser. Using a harsh soap (like deodorant body soap) can hurt already inflamed skin and cause more irritation. Avoid scrubbing your skin harshly with a washcloth, an exfoliating glove, or loofah (a coarse-textured sponge). Gently wash it with a very soft cloth or your hands. Always rinse well, and then dry your face with a clean towel. ( Toss the towel in the laundry hamper, as dirty towels spread bacteria.) Also, use the washcloth only once. 2. Moisturize. Many acne products contain ingredients that dry the skin, so always use a moisturizer that minimizes dryness and skin peeling. Look for ""noncomedogenic"" on the label, which means it should not cause acne. There are moisturizers made for oily, dry, or combination skin. 3. Try an over-the-counter acne product. These acne products don\'t need a prescription. Most of them have ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid, which curb bacteria and dry your skin. They may cause drying or peeling so start with a small amount at first. Then you can adjust how much you use and how often. Another option is a new OTC topical retinoid gel ( Differin 0.1% gel). It works to actually keep the acne from forming. Use these products with caution if you have sensitive skin. 4. Use makeup sparingly. During a breakout, avoid wearing foundation, powder, or blush. If you do wear makeup, wash it off at the end of the day. If possible, choose oil-free cosmetics without added dyes and chemicals. Choose makeup that is labeled as ""noncomedogenic,"" meaning it should not cause acne. Read the ingredients list on the product label before buying. 5. Watch what you put on your hair. Avoid using fragrances, oils, pomades, or gels on your hair. If they get on your face, they can block your skin\'s pores and irritate your skin. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Oily hair can add to the oil on your face, so wash your hair often, especially if you\'re breaking out. Got long hair? Keep it pulled away from your face. 6. Keep your hands off your face. Avoid touching your face or propping your cheek or chin on your hands. Not only can you spread bacteria, you can also irritate the already inflamed facial skin. Never pick or pop pimples with your fingers, as it can lead to infection and scarring. 7. Stay out of the sun. The sun\'s ultraviolet rays can increase inflammation and redness, and can cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark discoloration). Some acne medications may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Limit your time in the sun, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and wear protective clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and a broad-brimmed hat. Whether you have pimples or not, always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with 6% zinc oxide or higher and SPF 30 or higher at least 20 minutes before sun exposure. Look for ""noncomedogenic"" on the sunscreen label to make new pimples less likely. Read the ingredients on the product label to know what you\'re putting on your skin. 8. Feed your skin. Most experts agree that certain foods, like chocolate, don\'t cause pimples. Still, it makes sense to avoid greasy food and junk food and add more fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains to your diet. \x1b[92m[6] Dairy products and foods high in processed sugar may trigger acne.\x1b[0m Avoid these. 9. Exercise daily. Regular exercise is good for your whole body, including your skin. When you exercise, avoid wearing clothing or using exercise equipment that rubs your skin and may cause irritation. Shower or bathe right after exercise. 10. Chill! Some studies link stress with the severity of pimples or acne. Ask yourself what\'s making you feel stressed. Then look for solutions. When in doubt, check with a dermatologist to see if you need more treatment to prevent or stop acne.']",Does what you eat and drink cause acne?,"The relationship between diet and acne is complex and still under research [92m[0][0m.

But at least you'd like to hang on to what you've got. Short of a transplant, is there anything you can do to stop thinning hair? Yes. \x1b[92m[1] With some treatments, you can slow down or stop hair thinning -- and maybe even grow back some hair you thought was gone forever.\x1b[0m Read on to see what works and what doesn't. This is the only over-the-counter medication for hair loss approved by the FDA for use by both men and women. It won't rescue a receding hairline. It does stimulate hair growth, although scientists aren't quite sure how it works. Minoxidil is available as Rogaine or Theroxidil, or in generic form. It's sold as a liquid or foam and in two strengths: 2% and 5%. Effectiveness: Minoxidil works for about 2 out of 3 men. It's most effective if you're under age 40 and have only recently started to lose your hair. How to use it: Twice a day, when your hair is dry, apply minoxidil on your scalp where the hair has started to thin. Then be patient. You may not notice changes for 4 months or more. What it doesn't do: Minoxidil does not cure baldness. If you stop using it, you will start losing hair again. Your hair may fall out faster than before. Side effects: You may have redness, itching, dryness, flaking, or other scalp irritation, though this is uncommon. It's more likely if you use the stronger 5% solution. This medication stops your body from making the hormone at the root of male pattern baldness, DHT (dihydrotestosterone). It is available under the brand name Propecia. Effectiveness: Finasteride is very effective. It slows or stops hair loss in nearly 90% of men. About two-thirds of these men also regrow some hair. How to use it: Finasteride is a pill. Usually, you take it once a day. Your dermatologist may recommend using it in combination with minoxidil. What it doesn't do: Like minoxidil, it doesn't cure hair loss. If you stop taking it, you will lose hair again. Side effects: Finasteride can cause erectile dysfunction and other sexual side effects, though this is unusual. If it happens to you, it will likely clear up once you stop taking finasteride. But for some men, that can take 3 months or more. Biotin is a B vitamin that is essential for your health. You most likely get plenty of it in your diet in egg yolks, yeast, liver, and other foods. That's good news because too little biotin can cause hair loss. Does that mean that taking mega-doses of it will give you more hair? Probably not. No scientific studies have shown biotin to prevent or treat hair loss. You may have heard that laser combs, brushes, hoods, and caps can help halt hair loss. The theory is that when hair follicles absorb laser light at a certain level, it stimulates hair to grow. But there's not enough evidence that any of these devices restore hair or prevent balding. If you lose hair suddenly, see your doctor. It may be caused by illnesses, medicine, or low levels of iron or vitamin D.""]",Can you fix thinning hair?,"Thinning hair can often be addressed with various treatments and lifestyle changes [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m.

This recommendation is based on the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe infection and death, which is a worse outcome than a psoriasis flare. \x1b[92m[2] Most people who develop psoriasis flare-ups after vaccination do so after the first shot, but not the second shot.\x1b[0m COVID-19 Also Worsens Psoriasis It's important to remember that infection with COVID-19 can also lead to psoriasis exacerbation.

Q: What needs to be considered in deciding whether a patient should receive a live vaccine or a recombinant vaccine? ', ""https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/psoriasis-fall-winter\nFor some people with psoriasis, fall and winter bring shorter days, colder temperatures, and worsening psoriasis symptoms. Don't despair. You don't need to tough it out until spring, counting the days until you get some relief from psoriasis. Here are answers to seven frequently asked questions about psoriasis in fall and winter. Dry air and low levels of exposure to sunlight's ultraviolet rays likely cause worsening psoriasis symptoms during fall and winter. Not only are the winter days shorter, but most people tend to spend less time outside. And, when they do brave the elements, they're usually bundled up from head to toe. UVB rays are most prevalent at noontime in the spring and summer. All of these things add up to much less ultraviolet light from the sun, which may ease psoriasis in spring and summer. Experts believe that ultraviolet light hinders the rapid growth of skin cells that is characteristic of psoriasis. So you may find that your psoriasis is more likely to flare and your plaques worsen when you spend less time in the sun. Also, the lack of humidity in the air outside and the dry heat in most buildings during the colder months can rob your skin of the moisture it needs. You may be able to alleviate dryness-related psoriasis symptoms by regularly moisturizing your skin and using a humidifier at home. If possible, humidify your office, too. Definitely don't go running off to the tanning booth -- there are safer ways to get your psoriasis-easing ultraviolet rays. The medical use of light rays to treat psoriasis is known as phototherapy. A variety of options exist, which can be done in a doctor's office, psoriasis clinic, or even the comfort of your home. The form of light known as ultraviolet light B ( UVB) seems to be the most beneficial for treating psoriasis. Your doctor may prescribe a certain amount of UVB exposure depending on your symptoms. If your doctor does choose this form of light therapy for your psoriasis, ask whether you should consider purchasing a home UVB unit. Other phototherapy options for psoriasis treatment include the use of ultraviolet light A ( UVA) in conjunction with special medications that respond to these light rays. This is rarely used, however, because it can cause skin cancer. Looking for a reason to take a getaway to some tropical locale? It could be just what the doctor ordered to ease your psoriasis symptoms. The beneficial effects of a sunny vacation in the middle of winter could help ease psoriasis symptoms for a few months. Alcohol and key foods probably will not trigger a psoriasis flare. Though medical researchers have yet to prove that certain foods cause psoriasis flares, many patients report that eating certain foods seems to worsen their psoriasis. This, though, may be a coincidence. If you notice a regular connection between eating certain foods and increased skin symptoms, ask your doctor whether you can safely eliminate the suspect foods from your diet to assess any changes in your psoriasis. Alcohol binges are associated with worsening psoriasis. If you tend to smoke when you drink, you might be dealing yourself a double whammy. Evidence indicates that people who smoke tobacco products may be more likely to develop a form of psoriasis that causes pustules to develop on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Researchers have also found a correlation between smoking and more serious forms of psoriasis. If you suffer from psoriasis, an infection by bacteria and viruses can cause symptoms to flare. A strep infection, specifically, is a known trigger for guttate psoriasis, a form of the disease that causes red, droplet-shaped lesions to develop on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs. Although researchers don't know the exact cause of psoriasis, the immune system seems to play a key role in its development. Germs, illness, viruses or bacteria -- anything that temporarily revs up your immune system -- may cause your symptoms to worsen. Even something as simple as a common cold or respiratory virus may trigger a psoriasis flare. Strive to keep yourself healthy by eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, getting enough rest and keeping stress levels under control. \x1b[92m[10] Since getting the flu may temporarily alter your immune system and could worsen your psoriasis, you're wise to think about getting immunized against the flu.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[0] There should be no problem getting a flu shot during an active psoriasis flare -- just make sure the flu vaccine you receive does not contain any live virus.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[4] Due to a risk of complication from some vaccinations for people with psoriasis, always check with a health care provider before getting your flu vaccine.\x1b[0m Wool sweaters are synonymous with winter for some people with psoriasis, but the itchiness of the fabric may make your already irritated skin feel worse. Consider dressing in layers made from natural plant fibers, such as cotton, to keep you warm and comfortable. If you suffer from scalp psoriasis and find that flaking is a problem, choose lighter-colored clothes to hide dandruff. Stress is a known psoriasis trigger, and some people find the holidays very stressful. Try to counter the stress with relaxation techniques to keep yourself calm. You might try yoga, meditation, biofeedback, or even a long walk. Holidays are also a time of heavy drinking, which could possibly worsen psoriasis symptoms. And then, of course, there are the many social gatherings indoors with people who may have colds or other viruses, which could worsen your lesions if you get sick. To make your holiday season an enjoyable one, make every attempt to enjoy the time spent with family and friends and follow as healthy a lifestyle as possible.

That\'s baby talk, and baby talk sounds similar the world over. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context[\'wb.modimp\'] = \'vidfloat\'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $(\'.responsive-video-container\').insert After(\'.module-social-share-container\'); require([\'video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader\'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $(\'article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)\').attr(\'chronic_id\'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: \'in-article\', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $(\'.responsive-video-container\').remove(); }); } But when will you hear your baby\'s first words? Critical milestones for a baby learning to talk happen in the first three years of life, when a baby\'s brain is rapidly developing. During that time, your baby\'s speech development depends on your ""baby talk"" skills as well as your baby\'s. The first ""baby talk"" is nonverbal and happens soon after birth. Your baby grimaces, cries, and squirms to express a range of emotions and physical needs, from fear and hunger to frustration and sensory overload. Good parents learn to listen and interpret their baby\'s different cries. Just when your baby will say those magical first words varies greatly from individual baby to individual baby. But if your baby misses any of the following milestones in speech development, talk to your pediatrician or family doctor about your concerns. Baby Talk Milestones Baby talk at 3 months. At 3 months, your baby listens to your voice, watches your face as you talk, and turns toward other voices, sounds, and music that can be heard around the home. Many infants prefer a woman\'s voice over a man\'s. Many also prefer voices and music they heard while they were still in the womb. By the end of three months, babies begin ""cooing"" -- a happy, gentle, repetitive, sing-song vocalization. Baby talk at 6 months. At 6 months, your baby begins babbling with different sounds. For example, your baby may say ""ba-ba"" or ""da-da."" By the end of the sixth or seventh month, babies respond to their own names, recognize their native language, and use their tone of voice to tell you they\'re happy or upset. Some eager parents interpret a string of ""da-da"" babbles as their baby\'s first words -- ""daddy!"" But babbling at this age is usually still made up of random syllables without real meaning or comprehension. Baby talk at 9 months. After 9 months, babies can understand a few basic words like ""no"" and ""bye-bye."" They also may begin to use a wider range of consonant sounds and tones of voice. Baby talk at 12-18 months. Most babies say a few simple words like ""mama"" and ""dadda"" by the end of 12 months -- and now know what they\'re saying. They respond to -- or at least understand, if not obey -- your short, one-step requests such as, "" Please put that down."" Baby talk at 18 months. Babies at this age say several simple words and can point to people, objects, and body parts you name for them. They repeat words or sounds they hear you say, like the last word in a sentence. But they often leave off endings or beginnings of words. For example, they may say ""daw"" for ""dog"" or ""noo-noo\'s"" for ""noodles."" Baby talk at 2 years. By age 2, babies string together a few words in short phrases of two to four words, such as "" Mommy bye-bye"" or ""me milk."" They\'re learning that words mean more than objects like ""cup"" -- they also mean abstract ideas like ""mine."" Baby talk at 3 years. By the time your baby is age 3, his or her vocabulary expands rapidly, and ""make-believe"" play spurs an understanding of symbolic and abstract language like ""now,"" feelings like ""sad,"" and spatial concepts like ""in."" Babies understand what you\'re saying long before they can clearly speak. Many babies learning to talk use only one or two words at first, even when they understand 25 or more. You can help your baby learn to talk if you: Watch. Your baby may reach both arms up to say she wants to be picked up, hand you a toy to say she wants to play, or push food off her plate to say she\'s had enough. \x1b[92m[1] Smile, make eye contact, and respond to encourage these early, nonverbal attempts at baby talk.\x1b[0m Listen. Pay attention to your baby\'s cooing and babbling, and coo and babble those same sounds right back to your baby. Babies try to imitate sounds their parents are making and to vary pitch and tone to match the language heard around them. So be patient and give your baby lots of time to ""talk"" to you. Praise. \x1b[92m[4] Smile and applaud even the smallest or most confusing attempts at baby talk.\x1b[0m Babies learn the power of speech by the reactions of adults around them. Imitate. Babies love to hear their parents\' voices. And when parents talk to them it helps speech develop. The more you talk their ""baby talk"" with them, using short, simple but correct words, such as ""dog"" when your baby says ""daw,"" the more babies will keep trying to talk. Elaborate. If your baby points to the table and makes noise, don\'t just give him more noodles. Instead, point to the noodles and say, "" Do you want some more noodles? These noodles taste good with cheese, don\'t they?"" Narrate. Talk about what you\'re doing as you wash, dress, feed, and change your baby -- "" Let\'s put on these blue socks now"" or "" I\'m cutting up your chicken for you"" -- so your baby connects your speech to these objects and experiences. Hang in there. Even when you don\'t understand what your baby is saying, keep trying. Gently repeat back what you think is being said, and ask if that\'s right. Keep offering your loving attention so your baby feels rewarded for trying to talk. Let your child lead. During playtime, follow your child\'s attention and interests to show that communication is a two-way game of talking and listening, leading, and following. Play. Encourage children to play, pretend, and imagine out loud to develop verbal skills as they become toddlers. Read aloud. Lifelong readers come from young children who have plenty of fun, relaxing experiences of being read to out loud. Watch for any sign of a major speech delay in your baby, and talk with your doctor if you sense there\'s a problem. A speech delay can happen for a number of reasons, but the earlier a speech problem in babies is diagnosed, the more time you\'ll have to correct it and help your child reach his or her full potential before school age. After consulting with your pediatrician, here are things to do to help with delayed speech: Have a hearing test done. As many as three out of 1,000 newborns have hearing loss, which can cause delayed speech development. Most states require a hearing screening in the hospital right after birth. Take your baby in for a full hearing exam by age 3 months if he or she doesn\'t pass the initial hearing screening. See a speech-language pathologist. A SLP can diagnose and treat specific speech, language, or voice disorders that delay speech. Treatment may include giving parents tips and games to improve speech problems in babies and improve a child\'s language skills. Consider developmental screening. Up to 17% of children in the U. S. have a developmental or behavioral disability such as autism spectrum disorder or cognitive disability. Ask your baby\'s doctor about screening for these developmental problems, which can cause speech delays. What\'s the first step for babies learning to talk? \x1b[92m[2] Encourage your baby\'s first words with your frequent cooing, babbling, talking, and singing.\x1b[0m Keep responding positively and showing you care.

Personalized Treatment ', 'https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/small-lymphocytic-lymphoma-cancer\nSmall lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL) is a cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called a ""lymphocyte,"" which helps your body fight infection. You may hear your doctor refer to SLL as a ""non- Hodgkin\'s lymphoma,"" which is a group of cancers that affect lymphocytes. When you have SLL, too many ineffective lymphocytes live and multiply in your lymph nodes. These are pea-sized organs in your neck, groin, armpits, and elsewhere, that are part of your immune system. SLL tends to grow slowly. You may not have any symptoms when you\'re first diagnosed. A lot of people find out they have SLL when it\'s detected after a blood test for another reason. If you\'re not having symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. Instead, your doctor will watch your health regularly and won\'t suggest therapy until you need it. For some people, treatment knocks out the cancer for good, or keeps it from coming back for a long time. It\'s normal to have worries and questions about any serious condition. \x1b[92m[4] Learn about your treatment options, and seek out family and friends for support.\x1b[0m They can help you get through the emotional and physical challenges ahead. You can\'t ""catch"" SLL like you do a cold or infection. It\'s also not passed on from parents to children. Doctors don\'t know exactly what causes it. They do know, though, that the disease is rare in people under 50. The average age that people get diagnosed with the disease is 65. And it affects men more than women. A few things are linked to a higher risk of getting SLL: You have a condition that causes you to have a weak immune system, like HIV/ AIDS. You\'ve had chemotherapy. You live or work in a farming community. That\'s possibly because of exposure to pesticides and herbicides. You might not have any obvious symptoms when you\'re diagnosed with SLL. The disease might be found during a routine blood test. About one-third of all people with SLL live for years without having symptoms. When symptoms appear, they may include: Painless swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin Loss of appetite Fatigue Night sweats Fever Weight loss Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Have you ever noticed any swelling in your neck, armpit, or groin? Are you often tired? Is your appetite down lately? Have you lost any weight recently? Your doctor may also ask you to get a lymph node biopsy. This is the main test to diagnose SLL. Your doctor removes the lymph node and checks it under a microscope for signs of cancer. Many lymph nodes are near the surface of your skin. If that\'s the case, your doctor will give you a shot that numbs your skin. Then he\'ll make a cut and remove the lymph node. You can usually go home the same day. You\'ll have a small wound with a few stitches that can be removed in about a week. Your doctor may also do two bone marrow tests -- a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy -- to find out how advanced your cancer is. They are usually done together as part of a single procedure that removes marrow from the back of your hip bone. For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor first numbs the skin over your hip and the surface of the bone. He then inserts a thin needle into the bone and uses a syringe to suck out a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Usually the doctor does the bone marrow biopsy next. He removes a small piece of bone and marrow with a slightly larger needle. What stage is my cancer? Do I need treatment right now? What are my treatment options? Are there side effects to the treatments? How will my daily life be affected? What kind of follow-up care and monitoring will I need? If you have no symptoms, your doctor might recommend ""watchful waiting."" During this period, he\'ll monitor you and start treatment if the disease starts to get worse. If you need treatment, you have several options: Chemotherapy. You can get various chemotherapy drugs that kill your cancer cells. The medicine comes in pill form or may be given through an IV. You may be treated with one drug or a combination. Chemotherapy is a key treatment for SLL and can often put the disease in remission, which means you no longer have any signs of cancer, although it can return. Monoclonal antibody therapy. These are drugs that act like man-made antibodies that specifically target cancer cells. They help your immune system destroy them. Rituximab ( Rituxan, Rituxan Hycela) and alemtuzumab ( Campath) are two common types. You get both through an IV. Radiation therapy. This uses high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in one or two groups of lymph nodes in the same part of the body. It may be useful if you\'re in the earlier stages of SLL and the disease hasn\'t spread. Targeted therapy. These drugs attack one or more specific targets on cancer cells. Your doctor might suggest them if you\'ve already had another treatment that didn\'t work. Two examples are ibrutinib ( Imbruvica) and idelalisib ( Zydelig). Both are pills. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat SLL in clinical trials. These test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn\'t available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Besides new drugs, another treatment that may be part of a clinical trial is a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they\'re referring to ""embryo"" stem cells that are used in cloning. The stem cells in a transplant are different. They live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. This procedure may use your own stem cells or stem cells from a donor. If a donor supplies them, you\'ll need to find one who is the right match for you, so your body doesn\'t reject the new stem cells, or start fighting them the way it would fight an infection. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn\'t work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who\'s the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you\'ll most likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. Sometimes radiation therapy is also used. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. Certain medications can make these side effects less severe. When the high-dose chemo is done, you\'ll start the transplant. You get the new stem cells through an IV. You won\'t feel any pain from this, and you\'re awake while it\'s happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. Try your best to avoid infections. \x1b[92m[3] Eat a healthy diet, get proper rest, and stay away from sick people.\x1b[0m Ask your doctor about which vaccinations you should receive, such as shots to prevent flu and pneumonia. Living with a serious illness poses many challenges, both physically and emotionally. For strength and support, surround yourself with those who care about you. They can offer comfort, as well as practical support. You may also find it helpful to talk to a professional counselor, spiritual leader, or a support group. SLL tends to be a slow-growing cancer. In time, though, SLL can turn into a more aggressive type of lymphoma. After initial treatment for SLL, many people have a period of remission, when there are no signs of active disease. The illness may not return. But for some people, SLL does come back. If the lymphoma returns, doctors can treat you again. Treatment for disease that returns can be successful, and you may have another period of remission. This keeps your lymphoma under control for many years.

As the effect is generally only temporary, I caution against the frequent or prolonged use of cold compresses as a mainstay of a management regimen.

Use Antihistamines to relieve symptoms such as itching Antihistamines are one of the most effective treatments for relieving eczema symptoms such as itching. This type of medication works by blocking the histamine receptors in the body. This blockage prevents them from releasing chemicals that cause allergic reactions and inflammation. Common antihistamines include hydroxyzine, chlorpheniramine, loratadine, cetirizine, and diphenhydramine. These medications can be taken orally or applied topically to the affected areas. \x1b[92m[7] In addition to relieving itching, they can help reduce swelling and redness.\x1b[0m It is essential to consult with a doctor before taking antihistamines, as they may have side effects such as drowsiness or dry mouth.

Back to Top ', ""https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/eczema-home-remedies\nThere's no cure for eczema, but you can do plenty of things at home to give your skin some relief. Stay moisturized. Your skin needs moisture to heal and protect itself. Most lotions can't create a strong barrier for your skin because they contain water. Choose a thick cream or ointment instead. Petroleum jelly and mineral oil work well. Put it on your skin at least twice a day to keep your eczema at bay. Avoid drastic temperature changes. Going from a hot room into a chilly one may cause a flare-up. Try to keep your home at a comfortable, consistent temperature. Low humidity can dry your skin. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air. Skip long, hot showers. Very hot water will dry your skin and make your symptoms worse. Take lukewarm showers or baths instead. Use mild, perfume-free soap or non-soap cleanser, and avoid bubble baths. When you're done, gently towel off your skin -- don't rub -- until it's partly dry. Then, within 3 minutes, put on a moisturizer. If your doctor has prescribed an eczema cream, apply that to your skin first. Keep your house clean. Allergens like dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and mold put your immune system on alert, which can wake up your eczema. Skip scented laundry products. The perfume in many cleansers and fabric softeners can irritate your skin. You're better off using gentle, scent-free products. And always wash new clothes before wearing them. It'll help get rid of any excess dyes and chemicals that could inflame your skin. Wear loose clothing. It'll allow air next to your skin. Cotton or cotton-blend fabrics are good choices. That's especially helpful when you're working out because you're likely to sweat. Always avoid wool. It can rub against your skin and make you itch more. Try an over-the-counter oral antihistamine. Diphenhydramine ( Benadryl) works well to calm itching and help you sleep. Cetirizine ( Zyrtec) and loratadine ( Claritin) are non-drowsy options that may help you feel better during the day. Keep your cool. \x1b[92m[4] When your itching feels out of control, put a cold compress right on your skin.\x1b[0m If your eczema is severe, after you've put on lotion or medicine, make a wet wrap by soaking a gauze or piece of soft clothing, like a T-shirt or pair of socks, in warm -- not hot -- water. Wet wraps help your skin absorb medicine and moisture. They also relieve itching and pain. Once they're dry, you'll want to either make them wet again or remove them. Ask your doctor if you should take vitamin D. Experts say there's a link between eczema and low levels of the â  sunshineâ   vitamin. Check to see what supplement you can try for a boost. Stay calm. Angst and stress can make you itch and scratch even more. Look for ways to ease your mind. Talk with friends, try a yoga class, or learn how to meditate. Asking a loved one to give you a quick massage with a moisturizing cream or oil may help, too.""]",Does a cold compress help if you have eczema?,"Yes, a cold compress can be beneficial for individuals with eczema [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m.

"", ""https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-complications\nIf it is not controlled, diabetes can cause a host of complications that can affect nearly every organ in the body. Diabetes complications include: Heart disease Stroke Kidney disease Nerve damage Eye damage Digestion problems Erectile dysfunction Skin problems Infection Dental problems Heart disease is one of the most common diabetes complications. In office visits, your doctor may perform various tests to check for heart disease and help you prevent any serious heart-related problems. At every visit, your health care provider will check your blood pressure. Your cholesterol level and triglycerides may be checked at your first visit. A baseline EKG should also be obtained as part of a complete medical record. Learn more about personal risk factors you have for heart disease, such as a family history or whether you smoke, and work out a prevention plan that includes weight loss, regular exercise, and stress management, as well as keeping your blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides at normal levels. \x1b[92m[0] Signs and symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness on one side of the face or body; numbness in the face, arm, or leg; difficulty speaking; trouble seeing with both eyes; or dizziness.\x1b[0m If you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor immediately. You may be referred to a neurologist or other stroke specialist. Read more about the warning signs of stroke and also be aware of ways to prevent this serious problem from happening to you. If you have diabetes, urine testing should be performed yearly to look for diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease. A baseline creatinine blood test should also be done to determine your kidney function. Your health care provider will also check your blood pressure regularly, because control of high blood pressure is essential in slowing kidney disease. Blood pressure should be less than 130/80. Read about other symptoms of kidney disease in this health topic, such as persistent leg or feet swelling. Find out when to call your doctor to prevent serious problems. Over time, diabetes can cause nerve damage that produces symptoms of numbness, burning, or pain. If your skin becomes numb, you may not notice small wounds that could grow to become bigger health threats. Check your feet and hands daily for redness, calluses, cracks, or skin breakdown. If you notice any of these symptoms before your next scheduled visit, notify your health care provider immediately. To protect your vision, all people with diabetes should see an ophthalmologist (an eye doctor) at least yearly. As part of the eye exam the doctor will dilate your eyes so that he or she can see the back of the eye (retina) and determine if the diabetes is causing damage. In people with type 1 diabetes, these annual exams should start within three to five years of diabetes once the patient is age 10 or older. People with type 2 diabetes should have their first eye exam once they are diagnosed. Those with eye complications may need to see their ophthalmologist more frequently. Women with diabetes who become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye exam during the first trimester and close follow-up with an eye doctor during their pregnancy. ( This recommendation does not apply to women who develop gestational diabetes.) Diabetes increases your risk of gastroparesis. With gastroparesis, the nerves to the stomach are damaged and stop working properly. This causes the stomach to take too long to empty its contents and makes it difficult to manage blood glucose levels. Sometimes, changing your diet can help. There are some medications and treatments for gastroparesis. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent diabetes complications. Ask for information on early warning signs so you can seek treatment when it is most effective. Diabetes increases the chance of developing erectile dysfunction, or impotence. For some men, adopting a healthier lifestyle, such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and reducing stress, may be all that is needed to resolve erectile dysfunction. In this health topic, you'll also learn why it's important to talk to your health care provider about your erectile dysfunction, as your doctor can recommend other remedies -- including medications, a vacuum constriction device ( VCD), and other erectile dysfunction aids -- that can help. As many as a third of people with diabetes will have a skin condition related to their disease at some time in their lives. High levels of glucose in the blood provide an excellent breeding ground for bacteria and fungi and can reduce the body's ability to heal itself. Fortunately, most skin conditions can be prevented and successfully treated if caught early. If your skin is not cared for properly with type 2 diabetes, a minor skin condition can turn into a serious problem with potentially severe consequences. Type 2 diabetes slows down your body's ability to fight infection. High blood glucose leads to high levels of sugar in your body's tissues. When this happens, bacteria grow and infections can develop more quickly. Common sites of infection are your bladder, kidneys, vagina, gums, feet, and skin. Early treatment of infections can prevent more serious complications. People with diabetes face a higher than normal risk of serious dental and oral health problems. The more uncontrolled the blood sugar, the more likely dental and oral health problems will arise. This is because uncontrolled diabetes impairs white blood cells, which are the body's main defense against infections that can occur in the mouth. Whether you have diabetes or not, be sure brush, floss and rinse with antiseptic mouthwash daily. See your dentist for regular cleanings and checkups to prevent serious dental problems.""]",What signs and symptoms of stroke should I be aware of if I have diabetes?,"If you have diabetes, it's crucial to recognize stroke signs and symptoms, which include sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body; confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding speech; trouble seeing in one or both eyes; difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or lack of coordination; and a severe headache with no known cause [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging What is an MRI? \x1b[92m[5] An MRI is a test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to take detailed images of organs and tissues.\x1b[0m The atoms in your body respond to this energy. An MRI detects this response. When you get an MRI, you can't have any metal objects like jewelry or zippers because of the strong magnet. Unlike X-rays or CT exams, an MRI does not use radiation. Some MRI exams use contrast. Contrast helps improve the clarity of images to make a diagnosis more accurate. We perform many types of MRI exams, including breast MRI, cardiac MRI and prostate MRI. We also have an open MRI scanner at our Mass General Imaging - Chelsea location. Breast MRI "", 'https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri\nTo obtain an MRI image, a patient is placed inside a large magnet and must remain very still during the imaging process in order not to blur the image. Contrast agents (often containing the element Gadolinium) may be given to a patient intravenously before or during the MRI to increase the speed at which protons realign with the magnetic field. The faster the protons realign, the brighter the image. What is MRI used for? \x1b[92m[8] MRI scanners are particularly well suited to image the non-bony parts or soft tissues of the body.\x1b[0m They differ from computed tomography (CT), in that they do not use the damaging ionizing radiation of x-rays. The brain, spinal cord and nerves, as well as muscles, ligaments, and tendons are seen much more clearly with MRI than with regular x-rays and CT; for this reason MRI is often used to image knee and shoulder injuries.

It's especially useful for looking at soft tissues and the nervous system. A MRI of the brain and spinal cord looks for: Blood vessel damage Brain injury Cancer Multiple sclerosis Spinal cord injuries Stroke A MRI of the heart and blood vessels looks for: Blocked blood vessels Damage caused by a heart attack Heart disease Problems with the structure of the heart A MRI of the bones and joints looks for: Bone infections Cancer Damage to joints Disc problems in the spine Neck or low back pain with nerve signs MRIs can also be done to check the health of these organs: Breasts (women) Liver Kidneys Ovaries (women) Pancreas Prostate (men) A special kind of MRI called a functional MRI (f MRI) maps brain activity. This test looks at blood flow in your brain to see which areas become active when you do certain tasks. A f MRI can detect brain problems, such as the effects of a stroke, or for brain mapping if you need brain surgery for epilepsy or tumors. Your doctor can use this test to plan your treatment. Before your MRI, let your doctor know if you: Have any health problems, such as kidney or liver disease Recently had surgery Have any allergies to food or medicine, or if you have asthma Are pregnant, or might be pregnant No metal is allowed in the MRI room, because the magnetic field in the machine can attract metal. Tell your doctor whether you have any metal-based devices that might cause problems during the test. These can include: Artificial heart valves Body piercings Cochlear implants Drug pumps Fillings and other dental work Implanted nerve stimulator Insulin pump Metal fragments, such as a bullet or shrapnel Metal joints or limbs Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) Pins or screws If you have tattoos, talk with your doctor. Some inks contain metal On the day of the test, wear loose, comfortable clothing that doesn't have snaps or other metal fasteners. You might need to take off your own clothes and wear a gown during the test. Remove all of these before you go into the MRI room: Cell phone Coins Dentures Eyeglasses Hearing aids Keys Underwire bra Watch Wig If you don't like enclosed spaces or you're nervous about the test, tell your doctor. You may be able to have an open MRI or get medicine to relax you before the test. A typical MRI machine is a large tube with a hole at both ends. A magnet surrounds the tube. You lie on a table that slides all the way into the tube. In a short-bore system, you are not totally inside the MRI machine. \x1b[92m[7] Only the part of your body that's being scanned is inside.\x1b[0m The rest of your body is outside the machine. An open MRI is open on all sides. This type of machine may be best if you have claustrophobia -- a fear of tight spaces -- or you're very overweight. The quality of images from some open MRI machines isn't as good as it is with a closed MRI. Before some MRIs, you'll get contrast dye into a vein in your arm or hand. This dye helps the doctor more clearly see structures inside your body. The dye often used in MRIs is called gadolinium. It can leave a metal taste in your mouth. You will lie on a table that slides into the MRI machine. Straps might be used to hold you still during the test. Your body might be completely inside the machine. Or, part of your body may stay outside the machine. The MRI machine creates a strong magnetic field inside your body. A computer takes the signals from the MRI and uses them to make a series of pictures. Each picture shows a thin slice of your body. You might hear a loud thumping or tapping sound during the test. This is the machine creating energy to take pictures inside your body. You can ask for earplugs or headphones to muffle the sound. You might feel a twitching sensation during the test. This happens as the MRI stimulates nerves in your body. It's normal, and nothing to worry about. The MRI scan should take between 20 and 90 minutes. Pregnant women should not get a MRI during their first trimester unless they absolutely need the test. The first trimester is when the baby's organs develop. You also shouldn't get contrast dye when you're pregnant. Don't get contrast dye if you've had an allergic reaction to it in the past or you have severe kidney disease. Certain people with metal inside their body can't get this test, including those with: Some clips used to treat brain aneurysms Pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators Cochlear implants Certain metal coils placed in blood vessels A specially trained doctor called a radiologist will read the results of your MRI and send the report to your doctor.

Dr. Gil Center for Back, Neck, and Chronic Pain Relief 209 S Royal Oaks Blvd #222 Franklin, TN 37064 (615) 703-8084 ', 'https://www.thediscdoctor.com.au/spinal-decompression-therapy\nA Formula for Relief When a bulging or herniated disc slips out of alignment, it may compress nearby nerves. The compression can block the nerves from sending and receiving messages from the central nervous system and brain, leading to chronic pain. As long as compression continues, damaged discs seldom heal and patients will suffer pain and other symptoms. When Negative is Positive Spinal Decompression Therapy creates space between the different vertebrae, providing room for the bulging or herniated disc to be drawn back into its central position in the spine. This relieves pressure on the nerves and the surrounding soft tissues. \x1b[92m[21] By reversing the effects of axial load or compression in the spine, increased circulation occurs which facilitates the flow of nutrients, oxygen and fluids back into the disc which helps stimulate the body’s healing mechanism.\x1b[0m Your Spinal Decompression Therapy Program ', 'https://www.coremedx.com/spinal-decompression-danville-va/\nSpinal decompression therapy is a relatively new therapy which has a high success rate for pain associated with herniated, bulging and degenerated discs…even after failed surgery. \x1b[92m[1] It is a non-surgical, FDA cleared therapy for the relief of back and leg pain or neck and arm pain.\x1b[0m Decompression therapy which was originally pioneered by a Canadian Neurosurgeon, allows doctors to isolate specific discs which are damaged. Those discs are then treated by alternating distraction and relaxation cycles which create negative pressure inside the disc, which acts like a vacuum pulling fluid and bulging areas back into the center of the disc. How does this negative pressure affect an injured disc? During spinal decompression therapy, a negative pressure is created within the disc. Because of that negative pressure, disc material that has protruded or herniated can be pulled back within the normal confines of the disc, and permit healing to occur. ', ""https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/guide/spinal-decompression-therapy-surgical-nonsurgical\nIf you have lasting back pain and other related symptoms, you know how disruptive to your life it can be. You may be unable to think of little else except finding relief. Some people turn to spinal decompression therapy -- either surgical or nonsurgical. Here's what you need to know to help decide whether it might be right for you. Nonsurgical spinal decompression is a type of motorized traction that may help relieve back pain. \x1b[92m[17] Spinal decompression works by gently stretching the spine.\x1b[0m That changes the force and position of the spine. This change takes pressure off the spinal disks, which are gel-like cushions between the bones in your spine, by creating negative pressure in the disc. As a result, bulging or herniated disks may retract, taking pressure off nerves and other structures in your spine. \x1b[92m[19] This in turn, helps promote movement of water, oxygen, and nutrient-rich fluids into the disks so they can heal.\x1b[0m Doctors have used nonsurgical spinal decompression in an attempt to treat: Back or neck pain or sciatica, which is pain, weakness, or tingling that extends down the leg Bulging or herniated disks or degenerative disk disease Worn spinal joints (called posterior facet syndrome) Injured or diseased spinal nerve roots More research is needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of nonsurgical spinal decompression. To know how effective it really is, researchers need to compare spinal decompression with other alternatives to surgery. These include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Physical therapy Exercise Limited rest Steroid injections Bracing Chiropractic Acupuncture You are fully clothed during spinal decompression therapy. The doctor fits you with a harness around your pelvis and another around your trunk. You either lie face down or face up on a computer-controlled table. A doctor operates the computer, customizing treatment to your specific needs. Treatment may last 30 to 45 minutes and you may require 20 to 28 treatments over five to seven weeks. Before or after therapy, you may have other types of treatment, such as: Electrical stimulation (electric current that causes certain muscles to contract) Ultrasound (the use of sound waves to generate heat and promote healing) Heat or cold therapy Ask your doctor whether or not you are a good candidate for nonsurgical spinal decompression. It is best not to try it if you are pregnant. People with any of these conditions should also not have nonsurgical spinal decompression: Fracture Tumor Abdominal aortic aneurysm Advanced osteoporosis Metal implants in the spine Surgical spinal decompression is another option for treating certain types of back pain. But it is usually used as a last resort. If other measures don't work, your doctor may suggest surgical spinal decompression for bulging or ruptured disks, bony growths, or other spinal problems. Surgery may help relieve symptoms from pressure on the spinal cord or nerves, including: Pain Numbness Tingling Weakness Your doctor may suggest one or more types of back surgeries to relieve the pressure in your spine. In addition, you may need spinal fusion to stabilize your spine. The following are the more common types of back surgery: Diskectomy: In this procedure, a portion of the disk is removed to relieve pressure on nerves. Laminotomy or laminectomy: A surgeon removes a small portion of bone -- a section of bony arch or the entire bony arch -- to increase the size of the spinal canal and relieve pressure. Foraminotomy or foraminectomy: A surgeon removes bone and other tissue to expand the openings for nerve roots. Osteophyte removal: During the surgery, bony growths are removed. Corpectomy: This procedure involves removing a vertebral body along with disks between the vertebrae. As with any surgery, there are risks. These are some of the more common risks associated with spinal decompression surgery: Infection Bleeding Blood clots Allergic reaction to anesthesia Nerve or tissue damage Another risk of surgery is that it may not improve back pain much.

This is in keeping with not just the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) but is also consistent with the World Health Organization’s recommendation. \x1b[92m[2] All three organizations also recommend consideration of continued breastfeeding for the next 6-18 months with the addition of complementary solid foods.\x1b[0m The WHO even recommends continued breastfeeding up to three years of age, if both mother and child elect. I find that sometimes patients are made to feel guilty or unworthy if they discontinue breastfeeding before the initial six-month goal. Often, there are legitimate physical or psychological reasons warranting a change to formula. It’s my role to inquire as to why, assist and provide resources and support if needed, but never to judge. I emphasize that any amount of breastfeeding provides benefit to your baby. ', ""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding/your-questions-answered/\nHow long should I breastfeed for?Exclusive breastfeeding (breast milk only) is recommended for around the first 6 months of your baby's life. Breastfeeding alongside solid foods is best for babies from 6 months. You and your baby can carry on enjoying the benefits of breastfeeding for as long as you like. \x1b[92m[1] Breastfeeding into your baby's 2nd year or beyond, alongside other foods, is ideal.\x1b[0m Lots of mothers carry on breastfeeding when they go back to work or college.

"", 'https://www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk/breastfeeding-information/thinking-of-breastfeeding/how-long-should-i-breastfeed-for/\nThe decision about how long to breastfeed is very personal and can depend on a number of factors.  \x1b[92m[0] We provide information and support to help you make the decision that is right for you and your baby.Both the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF recommend that a baby is exclusively breastfed for the first six months (around 26 weeks), and for breastfeeding to continue beyond that time along with solid food for two years or more.\x1b[0m  The reality is that although most babies are breastfed at the beginning, very few babies in the UK continue to be breastfed beyond the first few months as we have one of the lowest breastfeeding rates for any developed country.This means that our society is not used to seeing breastfeeding and so schools, colleges, employers, families and communities lack awareness of breastfeeding. This can make the decision to breastfeed and to keep breastfeeding a more difficult one for a mother, particularly during times of change like returning to study or going back to work.Support and understanding of breastfeeding is growing. We know that every drop of breastmilk that a baby receives is valuable and the longer breastfeeding continues the greater the benefits to both your baby and you.Each month of breastfeeding lowers the risk of illnesses that can put babies into hospital. It also helps protect babies against becoming overweight or obese, which means they are less likely to develop diseases like diabetes in the future. Every breastfeed is beneficial for your baby and breastfeeding for even a short time, or in combination with feeding infant formula, will still benefit your baby.There is no need to decide how long you will breastfeed for at the beginning of your breastfeeding journey. You can take it day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month and even year-by-year. You can continue for as long as it feels right for you and your child.

"", ""https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-sam-e\nSAM-e is a compound that's made naturally in the body and plays an important role in normal bodily function. A synthesized form of SAM-e is considered a supplement in the U. S., but SAM-e has been sold as a prescription drug in parts of Europe for decades. Its scientific name is S-adenosylmethionine. SAM-e is also known as ademetionine and SAMe. SAM-e has good evidence as a treatment for osteoarthritis pain. Some studies have found that oral SAM-e is as effective as NSAID painkillers, such as ibuprofen and Celebrex. SAM-e takes longer to act than drugs do, but it also has fewer side effects than NSAIDs. SAM-e has also been used to treat depression for many years. Some studies have found that SAM-e might work as well as tricyclic antidepressants in relieving symptoms. However, many of these studies were flawed or too small to be conclusive. Other uses of SAM-e have not been studied as thoroughly. There's some evidence that SAM-e might help ease the pain of fibromyalgia and spinal cord damage caused by HIV. SAM-e may also help control cholestasis -- a buildup of bile in the liver -- particularly in pregnant women during the third trimester. One trial suggested that SAM-e might be helpful for adults with ADHD. However, more research needs to be done. Some people use SAM-e as a treatment for other conditions, such as liver disease, Alzheimer's disease, pain, migraine, and bursitis. We don't know the potential risks or benefits of these uses. There is no established ideal dose of SAM-e. For depression, many studies have used between 800 -1,600 milligrams daily. For osteoarthritis, 600-1,200 milligrams daily of SAM-e divided into three doses is common. Ask your doctor for advice. Sometimes, the dose of SAM-e is increased gradually over a few weeks. This can help reduce side effects such as restlessness or anxiety. There are no food sources of SAM-e. Side effects. SAM-e seems to be a relatively safe drug. High doses of oral SAM-e can cause symptoms like gas, upset stomach, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, anxiety, and skin rashes. SAM-e can also trigger an allergic reaction in some people. Risks. If you have any medical issues, check with a doctor before you start using SAM-e supplements. SAM-e might not be safe for people with conditions such as bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes. Because SAM-e can affect the blood vessels, stop using SAM-e two weeks before getting surgery. Interactions. \x1b[92m[5] If you take any medicines regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using SAM-e supplements.\x1b[0m SAM-e could be dangerous when combined with antidepressants or supplements that treat depression, like St. John's wort. SAM-e could also interact with some prescription painkillers, cough medicines, and treatments for diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Patients taking MAOIs should not use SAM-e without discussing it with their doctor. Given the lack of evidence about safety, SAM-e is not recommended for children or for women who are breastfeeding.

Over time, more than half of people with diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy. The good news is that you can lower your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy by controlling your diabetes. \x1b[92m[4] Women with diabetes who become pregnant — or women who develop gestational diabetes — are at high risk for getting diabetic retinopathy.\x1b[0m If you have diabetes and are pregnant, have a comprehensive dilated eye exam as soon as possible. Ask your doctor if you’ll need additional eye exams during your pregnancy. What causes diabetic retinopathy? ', 'https://www.venturaeyeinstitute.com/blog/heres-why-pregnancy-puts-you-at-risk-for-diabetic-retinopathy\nIf not managed or treated, gestational diabetes can harm both mother and child during pregnancy and after. \x1b[92m[5] For example, gestational diabetes is linked to high blood pressure during pregnancy, which increases a woman’s risk of having a stroke or blood clots during delivery.\x1b[0m Unmanaged gestational diabetes can also cause the baby to have seriously low blood sugar upon birth. Another cause for concern is diabetic retinopathy in pregnant women. Retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and even complete blindness if not treated. \x1b[92m[1] Diabetes causes retinopathy because high blood sugar — the driver of diabetes — damages the tiny blood vessels that support the retina in the back of your eye.\x1b[0m Over time, that damage can cause your blood vessels to bleed, leak fluid, and become blocked. Eventually, diabetic retinopathy alters the way your brain receives images from your eyes, leading to vision loss. What you can do ', ""https://www.retinarisk.com/blog/what-is-gestational-diabetes-and-does-it-affect-your-eyesight/\nIf left untreated, both gestational diabetes and preeclampsia can create an adverse impact on the vision of the women resulting in the partial loss of vision that may progress to blindness, if left untreated. Women may also experience other vision-related symptoms of high blood pressure and gestational diabetes such as seeing the 'aura' of flashing lights. \x1b[92m[0] Also, gestational diabetes, though a temporary form of diabetes, can cause damage to the blood vessels in the retina.\x1b[0m The blurring of vision could be the initial warning sign of gestational diabetes affecting eyesight. As the pregnancy progresses, the risk of vision changes caused due to the rise in blood sugar levels and associated hormonal and metabolic disruptions can increase. Hence, women with gestational diabetes and preeclampsia are advised to be watchful of the changes in their vision and consult an ophthalmologist at the earliest in case they experience blurring of vision or any other warning signs linked to their eyesight. "", 'https://www.retinarisk.com/blog/what-is-gestational-diabetes-and-does-it-affect-your-eyesight/\n\x1b[92m[7] Women with gestational diabetes may need to seek active medical intervention and use anti-hyperglycemic drugs or insulin to control their blood sugar levels within normal limits.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[9] They should use the medications as recommended by their physician in terms of their dosages and time for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels and preventing complications like hypoglycemia.\x1b[0m Post-pregnancy care Gestational diabetes often resolves spontaneously after delivery. However, in some women, the rise in blood sugar levels may persist due to which women can develop type 2 diabetes. Also, even if diabetes resolves after the birth of the baby, nearly 50% of women have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later. Hence, getting tested for diabetes about 6 to 12 weeks after the baby is born and later, once in every 1 to 3 years, is highly recommended for assessing your glycemic control. ', 'https://www.retinarisk.com/blog/what-is-gestational-diabetes-and-does-it-affect-your-eyesight/\nHowever, there is a sharp rise in the incidence of severe forms of gestational diabetes in recent years. \x1b[92m[6] It has also been found that a larger than ever number of women with gestational diabetes now need active medical intervention for controlling their blood sugar levels.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[10] In some cases, they also need to take insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs in order to maintain their blood sugar levels within normal limits.\x1b[0m These trends point to the adverse impact of unhealthy eating habits and improper lifestyle factors on the health of women. Sedentary habits, obesity, metabolic disturbances, PCOS, and several other factors may contribute to the more severe form of gestational diabetes in pregnant women due to which they can have difficulties in maintaining normal blood sugar levels. This can also increase their need to use anti-diabetic drugs or insulin.

[2008] 1.6.10 ', ""https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/retinopathy-causes-treatments\n\x1b[92m[2] In people with diabetes, high blood sugar damages the walls of the small blood vessels in the eye, altering their structure and function.\x1b[0m These vessels may thicken, leak, develop clots, close off, or grow balloon-like defects called microaneurysms. Frequently, fluid accumulates in the part of the retina used in tasks such as reading; this condition is called macular edema. In advanced cases, the retina is robbed of its blood supply and grows new, but defective, vessels -- a process called neovascularization. These fragile vessels can bleed, creating vision-impairing hemorrhages, scar tissue, and separation of the retina from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). The new vessels can also block fluid flow within the eye, producing glaucoma. It's important that anyone who has diabetes gets annual eye exams from an ophthalmologist so diabetic retinopathy can be detected early. When you visit an ophthalmologist, he or she will question you about your medical history and vision and will ask you to read an eye chart. The doctor will then directly examine your retina using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. Some of the features of diabetic retinopathy cannot be seen during a basic eye exam and require special exams. To get a better look at the inside of the eye, your doctor might administer drops to dilate your pupils and will then view the retina with lenses and a special light called a slit lamp. A test called fluorescein angiography can reveal changes in the structure and function of the retinal blood vessels. For this test, the doctor injects a fluorescent yellow dye into one of your veins and then photographs your retina as the dye outlines the blood vessels. The eye exam will likely also include a check for glaucoma and cataracts, both of which occur more frequently in people with diabetes and can cause vision problems. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy should involve both a medical doctor and an ophthalmologist. Your medical doctor can help you better control blood sugar and can treat other complications of diabetes that may worsen diabetic retinopathy, such as impaired kidney or heart function. Your ophthalmologist can directly treat retinopathy with a laser or a surgical procedure called vitrectomy, to prevent further vascular changes and preserve vision. Don't be surprised if your doctor recommends one of these treatments before you notice any vision problems: Before problems start is usually the best time for treatment. Laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy, called laser photocoagulation, works in part by creating tiny, painless retinal burns that seal off leaking vessels and reduce swelling. The number of burns the doctor makes and the number of treatments you need depend on the type and extent of your retinopathy and how well it responds to treatment. You may have to wait several months to find out if this treatment is improving your condition. Your doctor may recommend vitrectomy surgery if you have a hemorrhage that doesn't clear, if you have retinal detachment, or if laser treatment doesn't sufficiently halt the growth of new vessels. During vitrectomy, your doctor drains the gel-like substance inside the eye, allowing her to clear any lingering blood and to remove scar tissue. The vitreous fluid is then replaced with a substitute fluid. Rare complications of treatment may include blurred vision, headache, glaucoma, difficulty seeing in the dark, decreased peripheral and color vision, and bleeding. In most cases when treatment is recommended, the benefits outweigh the risks. Although both of these treatments can be very effective, your expectations for either treatment should be realistic. Typically laser or surgical treatment will not restore lost vision; however, treatment can prevent any additional loss of eyesight. If you already have vision loss, your doctor can counsel you about options for visual rehabilitation. Diabetic retinopathy can be minimized with a combination of strict blood sugar control and routine screening with eye exams -- though even with optimal medical care, it is not always possible to prevent or slow retinal damage. Studies have shown that maintaining near-normal blood sugar can decrease the chance of developing retinopathy and can help keep existing retinopathy from getting worse. Your doctor can provide you with guidelines that may include insulin and other medications, dietary modifications, and exercise. Intensive insulin therapy, which may include frequent blood sugar testing and the use of an insulin pump, may be an option. \x1b[92m[8] It's not always easy to stick to the disciplined lifestyle necessary to control your blood sugar; don't hesitate to tell your doctor if you need extra support to adhere to his guidelines.\x1b[0m Routine screening offers the best hope for early detection of diabetic retinopathy. People with type 1 diabetes should have a complete eye exam within five years of diagnosis; those with type 2 should have an eye exam at the time their diabetes is diagnosed. After these initial exams, all people with diabetes should have an eye exam at least once a year. Your doctor may recommend more frequent screenings depending on the severity of retinal damage and on other diabetes complications you have. Pregnancy can precipitate or worsen retinopathy in women with diabetes who take insulin, so any such woman considering pregnancy should discuss the risks with her doctor. Your doctor will usually recommend an eye exam before pregnancy, a second exam during the first trimester, and additional exams at intervals based on the status of your retinopathy. Women who suddenly develop diabetes during a pregnancy (gestational diabetes) are not at risk of developing retinopathy during the pregnancy. High blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and obesity can all promote diabetic retinopathy and should be treated. Smoking is also a culprit: Consult with your doctor about methods for quitting. Never ignore the symptoms of infection, which can worsen diabetic retinopathy. Cataract surgery can affect existing retinopathy, too, so discuss the timing of treatments for retinopathy and cataracts with your doctor. Researchers continue to investigate new drugs that may prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy; your doctor can provide information about the latest medications approved for these purposes. Depending on the severity of your diabetes and related complications, you may also want to discuss the options of pancreas and kidney transplants, which may protect against retinopathy. You or your child has been diagnosed with diabetes and you have not discussed retinopathy and routine eye exams with your doctor. You experience either gradual or sudden loss of vision. You have diabetes and are considering pregnancy. You are having trouble sticking to your doctor's recommendations for controlling blood sugar.

As long as they're showing signs of improvement, you're on the right track. How You Can Help Depending on whether your dog has a strain or sprain and how severe it is, your veterinarian will decide how to treat them. As a first line of treatment, they'll probably want to avoid surgery unless a tendon or ligament is ruptured. A typical treatment strategy for strains and sprains from your veterinarian can include the following: Rest: This is vital for healing. Your dog will need to take it easy while their muscles recover. Ice: Applying ice to the injured area can help reduce swelling and pain. Do this for 10-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. \x1b[92m[3] Compression: Using an orthopedic dog brace can help compress the injured area and support your dog's limb.\x1b[0m "", 'https://getodie.com/blog/a-complete-care-guide-on-how-to-treat-a-sprain-on-a-dog/\nDuring the X-ray procedure, your dog will be placed on a table or positioned in a specific way to obtain clear images. \x1b[92m[1] Sedation or anesthesia may be necessary to keep your furry friend calm and still during the procedure.\x1b[0m The X-ray images will then be analyzed by a veterinarian to provide a comprehensive diagnosis. Treatment Approaches for Dog Sprains The treatment approach for a dog’s sprained leg, ankle, or paw depends on the severity of the injury and the specific area affected. Mild sprains may require conservative treatment and rest, while more severe cases may necessitate surgical intervention. \x1b[92m[0] How to Treat a Dog’s Sprain When it comes to treating a dog’s sprain, the following steps can help promote healing and alleviate discomfort: Rest: Restricting your dog’s movement and ensuring they avoid activities that could aggravate the sprain is crucial.\x1b[0m This allows the injured tissues to heal without further strain. ', 'https://getodie.com/blog/a-complete-care-guide-on-how-to-treat-a-sprain-on-a-dog/\nIce Therapy: Applying ice packs wrapped in a towel to the affected area can help reduce swelling and inflammation. Remember to limit ice therapy sessions to 10-15 minutes at a time, several times a day. \x1b[92m[2] Compression: Gentle compression using a bandage or supportive wrap can provide stability to the injured area and help reduce swelling.\x1b[0m Ensure that the compression is not too tight, as it may restrict blood flow. Elevation: Elevating the injured leg, ankle, or paw can help reduce swelling by allowing fluid to drain away from the area. Use a soft pillow or cushion to provide comfortable elevation. Remember to consult with your veterinarian before implementing any treatment approach to ensure it aligns with your dog’s specific needs. Treating Wrist Sprains in Dogs Wrist sprains in dogs can be particularly challenging, as the front legs bear a significant portion of their weight. To effectively treat a wrist sprain, your veterinarian may recommend the following: ', 'https://tploinfo.com/blog/treatment-dog-sprained-leg/\n\x1b[92m[5] If your dog is prone to scratching, licking, or nibbling on their sprained leg, you may consider a recovery sleeve or e-collar to keep them from reaching it.\x1b[0m A recovery sleeve is generally preferred as it can prevent your pet from further aggravating the sprain or causing it to reoccur without compromising its range of motion. Wrap Your Dog’s Leg Alternatively, you can use a warm, damp towel at home and carefully wrap it around your dog’s sprained leg for about 10 to 15 minutes to help promote blood flow. Ace bandages can also be used to create a makeshift splint for your dog’s leg in case they’re in too much pain to move around properly. Wrapping your dog’s leg will help stabilize and protect it from further injury.

Imagine doing that all day and you’ll have a better idea of the weight and stress your dog puts on his muscles and joints. It takes lots of energy, strength, and flexibility to chase squirrels, scratch behind ears, wrestle with playmates, jump on beds, and leap for toys. Every now and then dogs overdo it, asking just too much of their front legs (shoulders, elbows, wrists, and toes) or back legs (hips, knees, ankles, and toes). Sprains and strains are common injuries. If you hear your dog yelp, he may need your help. The words sound alike, but they mean different things. Strains injure tendons that link muscles and bones. This can happen if your dog stretches too far, too much, or too often. Athletic dogs get strains, but this injury also can happen when a dog slips, falls, or jumps during normal play. In dogs, strains are common in the hips and thighs. Sprains harm the ligaments that connect bones, which causes joint damage. Sprains can happen to hunting dogs who jump hurdles, as well as to the average dog who may hurt himself taking a hard landing off the couch, or even by something as simple as stepping in a hole. The wrist and knee are common joints for dogs to sprain. One of the most serious injuries is a torn cranial cruciate ligament ( CCL), which connects the bones of the knee. The first warning sign of strains or sprains may be that your dog starts to limp or is suddenly lame, meaning he can’t use his leg. If this lasts more than a day or so, or if it happens again and again, it’s time for a visit to the vet. Both strains and sprains can be chronic (ongoing) or acute (sudden), and can range from mild to severe. Your vet will figure out what kind of injury your dog has based on what you tell her and the results of a physical exam and tests. She’ll want to know when you first noticed a change. You should explain: How your dog is acting differently. What he was doing if you saw the injury happen. What he is or isn’t doing since the injury. Is he sleeping more? Limping? Sitting with his leg extended? Not excited about going for a walk? Stiff? Not eating? These are signs he doesn’t feel well. The vet will check your dog’s muscles and joints. She’ll look him over first, then touch and press on certain points to see if they’re sore, warm, swollen, or out of place. She’ll want to see him walk, sit, and lie down. She may take X-rays or do an MRI or ultrasound to get a look at damage that can’t be seen from the outside. X-rays show problems with bones. The other kinds of images are better for seeing tissue damage. It takes the same kinds of things to get your dog back on four feet as it would take to get you back on two. Your vet will decide how to treat your dog based on whether he has a strain or a sprain, and just how bad it is. She’ll likely try to avoid surgery as a first line of treatment unless a tendon or ligament is torn. In a typical plan to treat strains and sprains, your vet may tell you to: Give your dog nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) to ease inflammation. Make sure to ask what is safe to give him. Some over the counter NSAIDs for people can cause serious illness and even death for a dog. Apply an ice pack or heating pad. Make sure your dog rests. Don't let him jump or run. Sometimes you may need to crate him. Walk your dog on a leash, taking it slowly at first. Use a brace or support to hold your dog’s muscle or joint in place. Try physical therapy, such as walk on an underwater or land treadmill, balancing on a ball or board. Massage the area. Put your dog on a diet. Surgery is in order for otherwise-healthy dogs that don’t get better, keep injuring themselves, or have a torn tendon or ligament. If your vet didn’t do an MRI or ultrasound the first time around, she may want to see these images before doing surgery. Depending on the type of surgery, you’ll need to keep your dog quiet and limit his activity for a week or longer. \x1b[92m[4] The vet may use a bandage or brace to support the joint.\x1b[0m If your dog moves too much or too soon after surgery, he could re-injure himself. Physical therapy can help him get back to being active at the right pace. Whether your dog has injured himself before or you just want to keep him from getting a strain or sprain, make sure he stays at a healthy weight and gets regular exercise. Obesity and inactivity make these injuries more likely.""]",How do you treat a dog's sprain or  strain?,"To treat a dog's sprain or strain, first, ensure the dog is calm and still [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m.

We all live with it each day. But how do you react to daily stress? For some people, life\'s stressors cause them to become irritable, short-tempered, or unable to concentrate on tasks. Others have interrupted sleep (trouble falling asleep or waking early in the morning with racing thoughts). Then there are those who react by eating junk food -- and a lot of it! ( Remember - desserts is stressed spelled backward!) The good news: No matter how busy your schedule, it is possible to manage stress and keep it from ruining your life. Simply stated, stress describes the many demands and pressures that we all experience, to some degree, each day. These demands are physical, mental, emotional, or even chemical in nature. The word ""stress"" encompasses both the stressful situation, known as the stressor, and the symptoms you experience under stress, your stress response. The problem with stress is that it activates your sympathetic nervous system, stimulating the release of stress hormones throughout your body. These hormones give you super energy and cause other changes in the body such as the ""fight or flight"" response. The ""fight or flight"" response makes your heart beat faster. You might feel very nervous, making it difficult to breathe. Short term, the ""fight or flight"" response causes changes that allow you to handle sudden stressful events. When you face fear -- or even recall a stressful or frightening event from the past -- the resulting hormonal changes super-charge your body to a state of high arousal. This prepares you for action. But long-term stress can be particularly difficult. When stress hormones stay elevated over time, there is a gradual and steady stream of harmful changes to the body. Long-term stress can suppress the immune system, which may lead to the development of diseases. Stress can be positive or negative, depending on the situation. Positive stressors (called eustress) may include an upcoming wedding, the holidays, or pregnancy. On the other hand, negative stress (called distress) results in the full-blown stress response. If continuous, negative stress can lead to loss of productivity, health problems, and exhaustion. Stress symptoms vary greatly from one person to the next, but the most universal sign of stress is a feeling of being pressured or overwhelmed. Other symptoms include: Physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches, chest pains, nausea, and diarrhea, and a sensation of numbness or tingling in your hands, arms, and face.) Problems getting along with family members, friends, and teachers. Changes in behavior at home (short temper, unexplained anger, crying for no reason). Regression -- behavior that is not age-appropriate. Dysfunctional sleep patterns, including nightmares, too little sleep, difficulty falling asleep, or even oversleeping. Communication difficulty or personality changes, such as becoming withdrawn or requiring much more attention than usual. Impatience. If you are experiencing a few of these symptoms, chances are that your level of stress is high. If left untreated, stress can lead to permanent feelings of helplessness and ineffectiveness. Now that you understand more about stress and the symptoms, try the following these 6 tips to unwind, de-stress, and get back in control of your emotional state: Identify the sources of stress. Try to figure out what\'s causing your stress symptoms. Maybe you are overextended (too many commitments) and feel fatigued and irritable. Once you identify the sources of stress, try to minimize these as much as possible. Talk it out. Talk to a friend, family member, or therapist if your stress level is too high. Getting your feelings out without others judging you is crucial to good mental health. Take time out. Before you reach your breaking point, take time out for solitude. Take time to nurture yourself, away from the cares and responsibilities of the world. Find time for inner strength and emotional healing. Set limits. Never hesitate to say ""no"" before you take on too many commitments. Especially if you are balancing work and family, it\'s important to prioritize. Saying ""no"" can help bring your stress to a manageable level and give you more control over your life. Try exhaling. Breathing can measure and alter your psychological state, making a stressful moment increase or diminish in intensity. Often, people who are anxious or upset take shallow breaths and unconsciously hold them. By paying attention to your breathing, particularly exhaling during tense moments, you will feel more relaxed. Buy a bottle of inexpensive bubbles (in the toy section at most stores), and use it to learn how to exhale slowly. Breathing from your abdomen, blow through the bubble blower with a steady stream of breath. If you blow too hard or too softly, you won\'t get any bubbles. But smooth, steady breaths will produce a nice flow of bubbles. Use this breathing technique (without the bubbles) when you are feeling stressed. Exercise daily. Exercise is thought to increase the secretion of endorphins, naturally produced substances in the brain that induce feelings of peacefulness. Many studies show that exercise, along with the boosted endorphin levels, really does increase confidence and self-esteem and reduce tension. Exercise also acts as a displacement defense mechanism for those who are ""stressed out."" What does that mean? If you\'ve ever walked for several miles, you know how hard it is to think of your problems when your mind is focused on walking. The problem with stress is that it\'s cumulative. In other words, if you don\'t have a healthy way of responding to stress or counterbalancing the ""fight or flight"" response, constant exposure to stress hormones overloads the body. Changes in levels of hormones produced by daily stress can hurt your health. When stress levels increase, it results in an overproduction of stress hormones that weaken the immune system. This can lead to physical and psychological problems. Chronic, or long-term, stress often results in high anxiety, insomnia, depression, gastrointestinal problems, and can even lead to dependency on drugs and alcohol (a self-medication solution that makes an already bad problem worse). Some studies show that the hormones associated with chronic stress are linked to increased fat in the abdomen. That, in turn, increases the risk of chronic and serious illness such as diabetes. \x1b[92m[2] When stress interrupts your life, causing sleep problems or making you feel anxious and out of control, talk with your primary health care professional.\x1b[0m He or she might recommend a professional therapist who can offer support and give you some practical lifestyle tips in how to manage stress without letting it take over your life']",When should I seek help for stress?,"You should seek help for stress when it becomes overwhelming and persistent, affecting your daily life, physical health, or mental well-being [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.

What causes the chickenpox virus to reactivate? '[The chickenpox virus] is always [in your body], it’s just dormant. It stays in the nervous system. As we get older, it can get reactivated,' says Sajida Chaudry, MD, MPH, MBA, a primary care physician and the Office Medical Director at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians at Odenton. The reactivated herpes zoster virus is also known as shingles. "", 'https://www.touchwoodpharmacy.com/can-you-get-shingles-if-you-never-had-chickenpox/\n\x1b[92m[3] If you had chickenpox when you were younger, the Varicella-zoster virus can remain dormant for years or even decades in your body before becoming active again as shingles.\x1b[0m It’s not fully understood why shingles can reactivate in some people and not in others, but some believe that it might be due to a lowered immunity after experiencing a separate infection. Shingles Treatment There’s no cure for shingles, but antiviral medications can speed up the healing process and lower your chance of complications. The most common complication of shingles is a form of long term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The pain caused by PHN occurs where the shingles rash was and can last for months or years after the rash goes away. The severity of the pain can differ, with some people suffering enough that they can’t go about their daily lives. Up to 18% of people who get shingles will develop PHN. ', 'https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2022/08/16/If-youve-had-Covid-look-out-for-shingles.html\nShingles, aka herpes zoster, is a disease characterised by a painful rash that anyone who has ever had chickenpox is at risk of getting at least once at some time in their life. A 45-year-old woman has a more than 30 percent chance of developing shingles in her remaining lifetime, and a man of the same age slightly less. After 50, the risk steadily increases. If you live long enough, you have a very good chance of experiencing this disease.

What’s the difference between chickenpox and shingles? Adults can develop shingles if they’ve already had chickenpox. Also called herpes zoster, shingles is a reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox.

Getty Images / Mixmike How You Get Shingles To develop shingles, a person needs to have been infected with the varicella-zoster virus.

Long term federal benefits: SSDI and SSI The Social Security Administration (SSA) pays disability benefits to adults of working age who 'have a physical or mental condition that prevents them from working and is expected to last at least a year or result in death.' SSA uses a different definition to evaluate disabled children who may also be eligible for disability cash benefits if their household has low income.

Disability and low-income benefits Disability benefits are cash payments for people who can't work because of a disability. You could receive benefits from a number of sources including the federal or state government or an insurance company (as an employment benefit or because you bought a policy privately). \x1b[92m[6] Eligibility may depend on how much you are able to work, when you stopped working, how long the disability is expected to last, whether you have paid into the insurance program for long enough, how old you are and what other income or assets you have.\x1b[0m Because 'disability benefit' can mean a number of different things, it is helpful to use the name of the specific benefit you are interested in.

It can be a big help at a time when you may be looking for relief from pain or new ways to deal with a swirl of intense feelings. \x1b[92m[0] Unlike hospice care, which is only given at the end of life, you can get palliative care at any stage of a serious illness, starting at your diagnosis.\x1b[0m It can continue for weeks or months, including while you get treatment. Any medical professional -- such as a doctor, nurse, dietitian, pharmacist, or therapist -- can provide palliative care, but there are also specialists in the field. Most hospitals have palliative services, and some have centers that you can visit without having to stay overnight. Your primary care doctor may also be involved in the palliative care you get. One of the most important goals of palliative care is easing the physical symptoms of the cancer itself and any side effects from treatment. Some of the prostate cancer symptoms you can get help with are: Trouble peeing or needing to pee often Problems with erections or ejaculation Loss of sex drive Pain in your lower back, hips, and upper thighs Different pain relief drugs can help, and palliative care specialists are trained to spend time to pick the right medicine for your needs. One common side effect of treatment, especially radiation and hormone therapy, is fatigue. Your palliative care team may recommend exercise and other lifestyle changes that can give you more energy. They may also suggest drugs, changes in diet, physical therapy, or deep breathing to handle other side effects such as nausea, vomiting, trouble breathing, sleeping problems, and lack of appetite. Sometimes chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery are considered ""palliative"" because they ease pain by shrinking tumors. The goal of all of these is to make your life more comfortable. Palliative care extends far beyond the physical. Experts can recommend support groups and counselors to help you manage depression, fear, and anxiety. They can also help you open the doors of communication with your partner to talk about sensitive issues like sex. Chaplains and other palliative care professionals can discuss spiritual or religious issues. They can even help you achieve lifelong goals. Palliative care staffers helped one person with cancer, who regretted not marrying his fiancee, to tie the knot right at his bedside. If you decide to stop treatment and move into hospice care, a palliative care team can help with that as well. Your health may not be the only thing on your mind. You may also be worried about having enough money and navigating the insurance maze. You might need legal advice about wills and advanced directives. Members of your palliative care team can offer assistance directly or can tell you where to get financial and legal help. They can also tackle transportation and housing issues if you have family members visiting from out of town.

Use of pancreatic enzyme supplements for patients with cystic fibrosis in the context of fibrosing colonopathy. J Pediatr. 1995; 127:681-84. Pancreatic insufficiency (PI) remains a significant issue for the majority of individuals with cystic fibrosis. Left untreated, it could lead to growth failure, weight loss, abdominal bloating, foul-smelling stools, or diarrhea. \x1b[92m[3] The use of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has helped to alleviate these symptoms.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.cff.org/medical-professionals/pancreatic-enzymes-clinical-care-guidelines\nHowever, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation received reports of 35 cases of colonic stricture between January 1990 and December 1994, which were considered to be related to high doses of PERT. Guidelines for dosing of PERT and avoidance of fibrosing colonopathy were published in 1995 based on a consensus conference organized by the CF Foundation in conjunction with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recommendations included target doses of PERT in infants, children, and adolescents, and a warning to use caution when PERT doses exceeded 2,500 lipase units/kg/meal. Since the publication of the original guideline in 1995, there have been a number of new publications relevant to the use of PERT in CF, some of which are mentioned below. Recommendations The majority of individuals with CF are pancreatic insufficient. Thus, provision of safe and effective pancreatic enzyme replacement is a key therapy in CF. \x1b[92m[4] Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy Recommendations Recommendations\x1b[0m ', 'https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0783-y\nPERT should be taken with the first bite of a meal and consider adding extra enzymes during or towards the end of the meal. \x1b[92m[6] Thus, if consumption of a meal is less than 15 min, all enzymes can be taken at the beginning of the meal; for a 15- to 30-minute meal, we suggest taking half the enzyme capsules with the first bite and the other half in the middle of the meal; for more than 30 minutes, we recommend taking one third at the beginning, one third in the middle and one third at the end.\x1b[0m The rationale for taking pancreatic enzymes throughout the meal is to mimic the action of our own endogenous pancreatic enzymes, where secretion from the gland occurs throughout a meal. Specifically, the more food that is ingested and/or the grater the amount of fat in the diet, the higher the amount of endogenous pancreatic enzyme secretion; thus, the number of PERT capsules consumed should reflect this. Table 3 gives a suggested clinical overview of PERT dosing for different age groups [17, 19, 80].Table 3 Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) suggested dosing in different age groupsFull size table ', 'https://aimedalliance.org/what-do-you-need-to-know-about-exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/\nThe pancreas produces amylase, protease, and lipase, three substances known as enzymes that are necessary for the normal digestion of food. \x1b[92m[2] Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) medications are made from the pancreas of a pig.\x1b[0m It is possible for a person to live without a pancreas. What is it? Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is a digestive disorder involving the pancreas and the enzymes it produces. Enzymes are chemicals released to bring about a specific chemical reaction, and the pancreas secretes many different enzymes that serve different purposes. Digesting food is a complicated process, starting in the mouth with chewing and the release of saliva. Once a person swallows food, acids in the stomach break it down. After about 15 minutes, the broken-down food moves to the small intestine. Here, the pancreas provides the necessary enzymes to convert the food into smaller molecules. These molecules are then absorbed into the bloodstream and sent on to nourish the body. ', 'https://mission-cure.org/complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/\n\x1b[92m[0] Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT).\x1b[0m PERT involves taking medication to replace the enzymes your pancreas would normally make so you can better digest food. This medication (pancreatin/pancrelipase) contains a mixture of enzymes extracted from pig pancreas and is given in the form of capsules or tablets.The goal of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is to mimic the function of the pancreas during the digestive process. While PERT isn’t as effective as the enzymes your pancreas would naturally produce, it can improve carbohydrate, fat, and protein absorption in patients. This can reduce the digestive symptoms of those with EPI, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption, which leads to nutritional deficiency.Some patients may also need assistance from their doctor or a dietitian to develop a plan aimed at getting enough nutrients from the foods they eat. This plan may involve a specialized diet and nutritional supplements, including vitamins and minerals.Learn more about pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). ', ""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pediatrics/articles/10.3389/fped.2023.943649/full\nOnce ingested and passed through the duodenum, the acid-resistant enteric coating degrades in the intestine's higher pH, permitting the release of enzymes for digestion. PERT should be taken with meals and snacks (2, 66). The goal of PERT is to optimize the nutritional status and alleviate the symptoms. \x1b[92m[7] The optimal dosage for an individual may differ based on body weight, severity of steatorrhea, and dietary fat intake.\x1b[0m In pediatrics, PERT dosing recommendations for EPI is age dependent. For infants, 2,000–4,000 lipase units (LU) per 120\u2005ml of infant formula or each breast feeding is recommended. For under 4 years of age, 1,000\u2005LU/kg/meal and 500\u2005LU/kg/snacks are recommended. For greater than 4 years of age, 500\u2005LU/kg/meal and 250\u2005LU/kg/snack are recommended (3) (Table 3). The ideal PERT therapy is established on its clinical effectiveness, the initial dose might be adjusted based on the clinical requirement and efficacy (2, 34, 67–69). TABLE 3 Table 3.

In some children, PERT may be started without additional testing and monitored for symptom improvement. In any child, regardless of results of testing, if PERT doesn’t cause improvement, additional testing to evaluate for other causes of the child’s symptoms is necessary. Additionally, most children with EPI will also require a multivitamin that contains appropriate levels of fat-soluble vitamins. Long-term Expectations ', 'https://www.cff.org/medical-professionals/pancreatic-enzymes-clinical-care-guidelines\nEvaluation of the Evidence 1. \x1b[92m[9] Pancreatic insufficient patients should consume a high-calorie diet with unrestricted fat that is appropriate to age and clinical status.\x1b[0m Such diets have been shown superior to low-fat diets in promoting growth and lung function. Consensus 2. A nutritional assessment should be performed regularly as a component of routine care in patients with CF. Additional assessment should occur when dosing of PERT is altered. Consensus 3. Enzyme dosing may be done either by grams of fat ingested or by weight. Dosing by grams of fat is more likely to mimic the normal pancreatic response to a meal, although weight-based dosing may be simpler and more convenient, particularly in older children and adults. Consensus 4. Infants generally require 450-900 lipase units/g of fat, OR 2,000–4,000 lipase units per 120 ml of formula or when breastfeeding. Infants generally ingest a higher amount of fat/kg of body weight than do adults. Consensus ', ""https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/epi-expect\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI) causes serious problems with how you digest your food. Your pancreas makes enzymes that help break down the foods you eat so you can get nutrients, vitamins, and minerals from them. When you have EPI, your pancreas doesn't make enough of these enzymes. To help you digest foods more easily, you can get treatments that replace them. Other treatments help you manage symptoms like stomach pain or acid. Supplements can give your body extra doses of important vitamins and minerals to keep your weight up so you stay healthy. You also can treat the health problem that causes your EPI, like cystic fibrosis, Shwachman- Diamond syndrome, or chronic pancreatitis. You may get chronic pancreatitis if you have alcoholism or pancreatic stones. \x1b[92m[5] Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (the doctor might refer to them as PERTs) are coated pills often made from pig pancreas juices.\x1b[0m PERTs can help you better absorb fats from your foods, ease symptoms like stomach upset or oily stools, and just help you feel better overall. There are several prescription enzymes. If your doctor prescribes this medication, take it at the start of meals or before you eat snacks, along with a liquid like water. Don't dissolve the pill in a liquid like milk or take it with any over-the-counter stomach acid medicine that has calcium or magnesium. These products can break down the coating and enzymes in your pills. The amount you take depends on your body weight. You'll start with the lowest possible dosage and take more if you need it. You may also take drugs to lower stomach acid along with your PERT. Your doctor can prescribe these, and they're also available over the counter: Proton pump inhibitors like esomeprazole ( Nexium) or omeprazole H2 blockers like cimetidine ( Tagamet, Topcare), famotidine, or ranitidine Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can help you manage pain. Emotional stress can also trigger pancreas inflammation. Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline ( Pamelor) may help ease pain. Gabapentin ( Neurontin, Gralise),, a drug that helps control seizures, can also help fight EPI pain. Pregabalin ( Lyrica), which is used to treat seizures and nerve pain, also shows promise. EPI makes it hard for you to get the right nutrients because your body can't break down your foods. You might not get enough vitamin A, B12, D, E, and K, and you probably don't take in enough fats. Your doctor can prescribe vitamin supplements to help you get the right levels of these nutrients. She can also tell you which over-the-counter supplements and dosage to take. It's better for you to eat small meals more often than big ones that are hard to digest. Low fat may be easier on your system if you have a severe case. But if not, make sure you get enough calories and fats to help you stay at a healthy weight. Talk to a dietitian or nutritionist to help you choose the right foods or create meal plans. If you smoke or drink, it's time to stop. Alcohol and tobacco both make it harder for your pancreas to work. Alcoholism is one possible cause of EPI. Smoking can lead to calcium buildup in your pancreas. Cystic fibrosis. Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, antibiotics, laxatives, and enemas. \x1b[92m[10] You can also eat a high-calorie, high-fat diet or take supplements to get the nutrition you need.\x1b[0m If you have cystic fibrosis and EPI, you may also get diabetes. Keep your blood sugar levels under control, and take insulin or other medications if your doctor prescribes them. Shwachman- Diamond syndrome. Your doctor may prescribe PERTs, a high-fat and high-calorie diet, and vitamins and supplements. Scientists are also working to see if stem cell transplants will treat this genetic disease. Chronic pancreatitis: If you have alcoholic pancreatitis, it's important to stop drinking. You may need to enter a treatment program or work with a counselor to stop. If you smoke, stop. If there are stones blocking your ducts, the doctor can remove them. If you have a systemic illness like lupus or cystic fibrosis, treatment for the underlying condition may help the chronic pancreatitis. Yes. Surgery can open ducts that are clogged or blocked by gallstones, and decompression can widen a main pancreatic duct that's too narrow. Another option is to remove your pancreas and give you an autologous islet cell transplant. These are cells from your own body that make insulin. The doctor will get them into your body through a vein in your liver. This surgery can ease severe chronic pancreatitis pain or prevent or ease diabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis. But it's only used if other treatments haven't worked. If other treatments fail, the doctor might remove a portion of your pancreas, but this is usually a last resort.""]",How is cystic fibrosis treated if you have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency?,"Cystic fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are often treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m.

The information should also include details of who to contact and how to contact them, in the event of complications or other concerns.

The tissue is then analyzed in a laboratory to help doctors diagnose a variety of disorders and diseases in the liver. A liver biopsy is most often performed to help identify the cause of: Persistent abnormal liver blood tests (liver enzymes) Unexplained yellowing of the skin (jaundice) A liver abnormality found on ultrasound, CT scan, or nuclear scan Unexplained enlargement of the liver A liver biopsy can also be used to estimate the degree of liver damage, to grade and stage hepatitis B and C, and to determine the best treatment for the damage or disease. In most instances, there are no complications in obtaining a liver biopsy. However, rarely, internal bleeding may occur, as well as a leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder. There is a slight risk of a pneumothorax, also called a collapsed lung, if the biopsy needle makes a hole in the chest wall causing air to enter. When preparing for a liver biopsy, you should: Tell your doctor if you're pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, are allergic to any medications, or have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medications such as aspirin, Coumadin, Plavix, or Eliquis. Your doctor may prescribe an alternate method for thinning your blood before the procedure. Talk with your doctor about the procedure. Have any necessary blood tests done. Find out how long before the procedure you'll need to stop eating. Arrange for a ride home after the procedure. For the week before the procedure, do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Naprosyn, or Indocin) unless otherwise advised by your doctor. Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor. Laboratory tests will be performed on the day of a liver biopsy or 2-3 days before the procedure, as directed by your doctor. These tests may include a blood count, a platelet count, and a measurement of your blood's ability to clot. Before the procedure: A doctor will explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications, and answer any questions you may have. During the procedure, which takes about 5 minutes: You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back, with your right elbow out to the side and your right hand under your head. It is important that you remain as still as possible during the procedure. An ultrasound may be used to mark the location of your liver. You may receive a small dose of a sedative just prior to the procedure. The doctor will clean and numb an area on your upper abdomen with a local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication). The doctor will then make a small incision on your upper abdomen and insert a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis. After the procedure: You will stay in a recovery room for up to 4 hours for observation. You may feel minor pain or soreness at the biopsy site and discomfort or a dull pain in your shoulders or back. If necessary, a pain medication will be prescribed for you. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after the procedure. Avoid taking aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Naprosyn, Indocin, or Motrin) for one week after the procedure. You may take acetaminophen ( Tylenol) if needed. Do not perform vigorous physical activity or heavy lifting for at least 24 hours and up to 1 week after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the biopsy results with you several days after the procedure. Two other methods of liver biopsy may also be available: laparoscopic and transvenous. During a laparoscopic biopsy, a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the doctor watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver. A transvenous biopsy may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver. A biopsy needle is placed into the catheter and then into the liver to obtain a sample. \x1b[92m[1] If these symptoms occur within 72 hours of the biopsy, call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room: Fever Dizziness Chills Difficulty breathing Chest pain Abdominal swelling or bloating Increasing abdominal pain Tenderness or severe pain or redness at the site of the biopsy or in the shoulder, chest, or abdomen\x1b[0m""]",What symptoms should I look out for within 72 hours of my liver biopsy?,"After a liver biopsy, it's crucial to monitor for symptoms that could indicate complications [92m[0][0m.

When you notice something on your skin, it can be hard to figure out what the problem is. Rashes often look alike, and lots of things cause them. And two people with the same condition may have very different symptoms. Parapsoriasis is the term for a group of rare skin problems that look like psoriasis but behave differently. Your doctor may need to take a sample of your skin (biopsy) to be sure of what you have. Like psoriasis, parapsoriasis shows up as a patchy rash. Spots are usually pink or red but also can appear brown or yellowish. They can be raised and bumpy with a scaly or wrinkly appearance. You typically get them on your chest, stomach, and back, but they also may appear on your arms and legs. They're generally round or oval but can be different sizes. You may itch, but you probably won't have any other symptoms. There are two kinds: Small-plaque: Rash spots are less than 5 cm across. It's usually considered harmless. Large-plaque: Rashes are bigger and sometimes irregularly shaped. Some people with this form develop a kind of lymphoma called mycosis fungoides. It's a cancer of the white blood cells that starts in the skin. Some doctors consider large-plaque parapsoriasis a separate disease. Others think it's just an early stage of mycosis fungoides. These skin problems can look similar at the skin surface, but they are different under a microscope. The rash pattern of guttate psoriasis looks like parapsoriasis and also shows up on your chest. But it tends to come on after an infection. The plaque form of psoriasis may look like parapsoriasis when you first notice it, but it eventually becomes thick patches of flaky skin, usually on your knees, elbows, scalp, and lower back. Psoriasis is diagnosed most often in young adults and children and in more women than men. Most people who get parapsoriasis are middle-aged men. Many treatments for parapsoriasis are the same as those for other inflammatory skin diseases: Your doctor probably will prescribe a steroid cream or other medication to put on the rash. Your doctors may recommend light therapy to help with your symptoms. It's usually done in a doctor's office or with an at-home unit that delivers a controlled dose of UVB light. Sunlight may help, too. Moisturizers can make your skin look better. The skin problem can last for months or years. Small-plaque may go away on its own. \x1b[92m[0] It should be checked about once a year, more often if it seems to change.\x1b[0m Large-plaque doesn't go away without treatment.

You may need to take the antibiotics even after you feel better to keep your symptoms from getting worse again. There are two ways these drugs treat the inflammation in your gut from Crohn\'s. Researchers believe they might help control symptoms by reducing bacteria levels in your intestine and by curbing the intestine\'s immune system. You\'ll also get them to treat specific infections and complications. Abscesses. These are pockets of pus that, in Crohn\'s, often form near the anus. Fistulas. These are abnormal tunnels that go from one part of your intestine to another or to nearby areas, such as the bladder, vagina, anus, or skin. Pouchitis. For some people, Crohn\'s disease is so severe that they need an operation to have their colon removed. The surgeon makes an internal pouch to hold solid waste before it leaves your body. If this area becomes inflamed -- known as ""pouchitis"" -- you\'ll need antibiotics for treatment. The most common ones used for Crohn\'s are: Ciprofloxacin ( Cipro) Metronidazole ( Flagyl) Some people need to get antibiotics through a vein ( IV). Side effects of metronidazole may include: Nausea Loss of appetite Metallic taste Diarrhea Dizziness Headaches Dark urine Side effects are more common at higher doses. With metronidazole, you may also have numbness or tingling in your hands. If you do, you\'ll need to stop taking it. Although this side effect is rare, sometimes it doesn\'t go away.

192,174,"[""https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/vomiting-in-babies\nProjectile vomiting is vomiting with force. Projectile vomiting can be a symptom of a blockage at the outlet of a baby's stomach. If it's happening after most or all feeds, take your baby to a doctor. What causes babies to vomit? Generally, mild vomiting occurs because a young baby is still getting used to feeding on, digesting and eliminating milk. On average, a newborn baby’s stomach can hold around 20 millilitres, so it doesn’t take much milk for them to fill up and vomit the excess. How can I tell if my baby is sick? Vomiting by itself can be reassuring. \x1b[92m[0] However, if your baby has a temperature, is not feeding well, has diarrhoea or a rash, or experiences any other symptoms, your baby needs to see a doctor.\x1b[0m If your baby seems healthy and well and is bright and alert, you may just want to monitor their vomiting to see when and how often it happens — but note that the amount that a baby vomits can be hard to work out and may seem larger than it really is. "", ""https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/when-call-newborns-doctor\nWouldn't it be great if your newborn came home from the hospital with a set of instructions and rules that spelled out exactly when you need to call the pediatrician? But she doesn't. And your little one can't tell you what's wrong. So it's important to know the signs of serious problems. Trouble breathing. \x1b[92m[1] If your baby is breathing more than 60 breaths a minute, having pauses in breathing, or has a bluish tint to her skin, lips, and nails, it could be a lung or heart condition.\x1b[0m Fever. If the baby's temperature measured in the rectum is 100.4 F or higher, she has a fever. For the first 3 months of your baby's life, take temperatures in the rectum, not in the ear, mouth, or under the armpit. Fever in newborns may be due to a serious condition such as bacterial meningitis or sepsis, a bloodstream infection. Both can be life-threatening if they aren't treated right away. Before you call, write down your child's temperature and the exact time you took it. Blood in vomit or stool. It may just be due to diaper rash, but it could also be a sign of a more serious stomach condition. Yellowish skin or eyes. This can be a sign of jaundice, which usually develops between the second and fourth day after birth. You can check by pressing gently on your infant's forehead -- if the skin looks yellow, she may have mild jaundice. Most hospitals check your newborn for jaundice before she goes home, but it can develop in breastfed babies anytime during the first week of life. Your pediatrician will check for it during the first office visit, 1-3 days after the baby leaves the hospital. Your baby is sleeping more than usual or won't wake up. It's true that most newborns can sleep pretty much through anything. But if your baby won't stir even after you've undressed her or prodded her a bit, it's time to call the doctor. Not eating. If your newborn refuses several feedings in a row or seems to be eating less than usual, check with your doctor. Not peeing. A healthy newborn has 6 to 8 wet diapers in 24 hours after day 4 of life. If she has fewer than that, she may be dehydrated. Other signs include sunken eyes and a sunken fontanel (the soft spot on your baby's head), and no tears when crying. Diarrhea. This can be hard to notice in a newborn, especially a breastfeeding one, as she has frequent, soft stools. If you suddenly notice more frequent bowel movements (for example, several while eating) or very watery ones, it could be diarrhea. Call your pediatrician if it goes on for 6-8 diaper changes. Constipation. Your newborn should have a bowel movement at least once a day during the first month. If she doesn't, call your doctor, as the baby may not be eating enough. After that, a formula-fed infant should have one at least one a day, but breastfed infants can go several days or even a week without one. If your baby is 1 month or older and is constipated (no pooping, or hard stool), you can try giving apple or pear juice (1 ounce a day for every month of life, so a 2-month-old would get 2 ounces). If that doesn't help after a day or two, call your pediatrician. A cold that doesn't get better. Even newborns come down with colds. Most of the time, the congestion and runny nose is uncomfortable for your little one but isn't serious. But call the doctor if your baby is so stuffed up she has trouble feeding or sleeping, if she seems especially cranky, or if nasal symptoms last longer than 10-14 days. Vomiting. It's normal for your newborn to spit up small amounts of milk within an hour after being fed. But if the flow is particularly forceful and happens more than two or three times in a day, call your doctor. It could indicate an infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or, in rare cases, pyloric stenosis, a thickening of stomach muscles that requires surgery. Tender belly button or penis. If your baby's umbilical area or penis (for circumcised boys) becomes red or starts to ooze or bleed, it could be a sign of a bacterial infection, and it needs antibiotic treatment right away. Diaper rash that doesn't go away. More than half of all babies get redness around their diaper area. You can treat it with a thick layer of zinc oxide or petroleum, but if it doesn't get better within 48 to 72 hours, bleeds, or you see pus-filled sores, call your doctor. Your baby may have a yeast or bacterial infection and will need medication. If you're worried, pick up the phone. It's always best to err on the side of caution, especially when it comes to newborns. Pediatricians' offices are used to fielding calls from anxious parents and can always help ease your worries or tell you what to do. Before calling your doctor, make sure to have a pen and paper to write down any instructions he might give.

', ""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/surgeries-that-treat-cervical-cancer\nIf you have cervical cancer, there are a number of ways your doctor can treat your condition. Which one he recommends will depend on what type of cervical cancer you have, your age, and whether or not you might want to have children in the future. It will also depend on whether, or how far, the cancer has spread. Doctors call this the â  stageâ   it's in. Surgery is just one option to discuss with your doctor. Your doctor uses a gas called liquid nitrogen to freeze the abnormal cancer cells on your cervix. An â  ice ballâ   forms, and the bad cells die. Your doctor can perform this procedure in his office or clinic. You can go home after the procedure. You may have a watery discharge for a few weeks. Cryosurgery is typically used during stage 0, which means your doctor has found abnormal cells only on the surface of your cervix. This is performed in your doctor's office or clinic and is usually reserved for stage 0 cervical cancer. Your doctor uses a laser beam to burn off the cancer cells on your cervix. He may also cut a small piece of tissue to examine in a lab. He'll numb your cervix so you won't have any pain. Your doctor may do this before he recommends chemotherapy or radiation. If you want to be able to have kids later, it may be the only treatment he recommends. Your doctor uses a surgical or laser knife to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix. He may also use a thin wire heated by electricity. This is called the loop electrosurgical excision procedure, or LEEP. He'll look at your tissue sample under a microscope. If the edges of the cone have cancer cells, some of the cancer may have been left behind. Your doctor may then recommend chemo or radiation. In this procedure, a surgeon removes your uterus and cervix. Your other reproductive organs -- your ovaries and fallopian tubes -- are left in place, unless there's a medical reason they should be removed, too. Surgeons perform hysterectomies in one of three ways: through a cut in the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy); through the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy); or with the help of robotic instruments (laparoscopic hysterectomy). You'll have to stay in the hospital after your surgery. With a laparoscopic or vaginal hysterectomy, you'll have a 1- or 2-day stay. Full recovery time is about 2 to 3 weeks. After an abdominal hysterectomy, you'll stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 days. Recovery time is longer -- about 4 to 6 weeks. Complications are rare, but can include excessive bleeding, infection, or damage to your urinary system or intestines. During this surgery, the surgeon removes your uterus and the tissues next to it. He'll also remove about 1 inch of the vagina next to your cervix. And, he may take some of the lymph nodes from your pelvic area. These are pockets of immune system tissue that are about the size of a pea. He'll leave your ovaries and fallopian tubes, unless it's medically necessary to take them, too. Most of the time, this surgery is performed through your abdomen. But your doctor may be able to use laparoscopy to remove your uterus through your vagina. This results in less blood loss, and maybe a shorter hospital stay. Full recovery time is 4 to 6 weeks. Call your doctor right away if you have excessive bleeding, trouble peeing, or believe your wound is infected. If you still want to be able to have kids, your doctor may recommend a trachelectomy. The surgeon removes your cervix and the top part of your vagina, but he leaves your uterus intact. He places a stitch, or a band, where your cervix had been. This opening leads to your uterus. He may also remove the lymph nodes near your cervix or uterus. He'll perform this surgery either through your vagina or through a cut in your abdomen. The chance of your cancer coming back after this operation is very low. Studies show that women who have a trachelectomy have a 50% chance of getting pregnant 5 years later. But they also are at a higher risk of miscarriage than women who haven't had this surgery. If you've had cervical cancer that came back, your doctor may suggest this as a surgical option. He'll remove your cervix, uterus, and surrounding organs and tissues. He'll also remove nearby lymph nodes. And, depending on where the cancer has spread, he may take your bladder, vagina, rectum, and part of your colon. If your doctor has to remove part of your bladder or colon, he'll have to create a new way for you to remove waste. \x1b[92m[0] You may have to have a catheter.\x1b[0m Or, he'll attach a plastic bag to the front of your abdomen to catch urine, called a urostomy, or feces, called a colostomy. Your doctor can also create a new vagina from your skin, tissue from your intestines, or muscle or skin grafts.

'Osteoarthritis has a pattern to it, so you'll have pain or stiffness when you get up in the morning or after using a joint for a long period of time,' explains Dr. Klippel.See a doctor if the joint pain persists or is accompanied by swelling, or if you have difficulty using the joint. Other types of arthritis should be ruled out, such as rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, lupus, or Lyme disease. 5. Depression 'I'm very depressed, and I know it's menopause' is a complaint that Dr. Minkin hears several times a day from her patients. We know from studies that giving estrogen to women during perimenopause (the transition to menopause during which menstrual periods become irregular and hot flashes may start) helps reduce their depression. \x1b[92m[0] Other studies have suggested that estrogen improves mood in postmenopausal women who feel depressed.\x1b[0m "", ""https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/mistakes-with-ra\nYou do your best to live a full, active life with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA). But do you recognize any of these common missteps? If they sound familiar, it's not too late to get back on track. Your regular doctor may have diagnosed your RA. It's still a good idea to see a specialist, too. Rheumatologists are doctors who are experts in treating RA and other types of arthritis. A rheumatologist will have the most training in the medicines that treat RA and in finding the right ones for you. If you don't have one, ask your primary care doctor for a referral. You need rest, just not too much. When you have joint pain and fatigue, it's hard to get up and get moving. But regular exercise is key for your health. \x1b[92m[1] Too much idle time makes pain, fatigue, and stiffness worse.\x1b[0m When your RA flares, slow down but don't stop. Do gentle flexibility exercises, like yoga and tai chi. You may also be able to do some exercises in a warm pool, but take it easy. When you feel better, step up your activity. Add strength training (you can use weight machines at a gym, handheld weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight) to strengthen the muscles around your joints. You should also do cardio for your heart, bones, and mood. Talk to your rheumatologist, or a physical or occupational therapist, about the best exercises for you. Walking can be a good exercise for people with RA. It's low-impact, and you can do it anywhere for free. Swimming and water aerobics are also good choices. When you feel good, do you stop seeing your doctor? You need those regular checkups to keep feeling good and to keep your treatment on track. During regular visits, your rheumatologist will check on how you're doing, how well your treatment is going, whether you have any side effects, and tweak your treatment, if needed. In addition to seeing your doctor, you also may need lab tests or X-rays now and then. Make sure you keep those appointments, too. If your doctor prescribed more than one RA medicine, there's a good reason for that. One of those drugs may ease your pain, while the other helps to stop joint damage. If you're not sure what your drugs do or why you need them, ask your doctor. Also tell her if side effects or costs are problems. She can help you look for solutions, whether it's another drug or help with costs, so you can keep up with your treatment. You may be tempted to skip your medications on days when you're feeling better. Don't do that. Missing a dose could cause the pain to return, and it may be harder to get relief later. Your RA could also worsen. Some drugs need to stay in your bloodstream at specific levels in order to be effective. If you skip them too often, blood levels of the medication will drop and you could end up with a flare of your RA. You might forget a dose once in a while, and that's OK. Just take it as soon as you remember (but don't take a double dose). RA can be painful and challenging. It's normal to feel sad about that at times. But if you start to feel depressed -- for instance, your blue feelings don't lift, and you don't enjoy the things you used to like -- tell your doctor so you can get treated and feel better. Your doctor can refer you to a counselor for â  talk therapyâ   and prescribe antidepressants if needed. You may also want to join a support group for people with RA, such as those offered by the Arthritis Foundation. Ask your doctor for more information.""]",Is it bad to overlook my mood if I have rheumatoid arthritis?,"Overlooking your mood when you have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not advisable [92m[0][0m.

Nebulizers are particularly effective in delivering asthma medications to infants and small children and to anyone who has difficulty using an asthma inhaler. It is also convenient when a large dose of an inhaled medication is needed. Nebulized therapy is often called a ""breathing treatment."" And a variety of medications -- both for immediate relief and maintenance of asthma symptoms -- are available for use with a nebulizer. Nebulizers come in home (tabletop) and portable models. Home nebulizers are larger and must be plugged into an electrical outlet. Portable nebulizers run on batteries -- either disposable or rechargeable -- or can be plugged into a car\'s cigarette lighter. Smaller, portable units are slightly larger than a deck of cards, so they can be carried in a purse, briefcase, or backpack to be used whenever and wherever you need them. To obtain a nebulizer, you need a prescription from your doctor, or it can be dispensed from your pediatrician\'s office. ( Oftentimes, a breathing treatment is administered at the doctor\'s office.) Home nebulizers vary in cost, ranging from about $50 and up, plus the cost of accessories. Portable nebulizers usually cost a little more than home nebulizers. Both are usually covered under the durable medical equipment portion of health insurance policies. But, most insurance companies will require you to work with a specified durable medical equipment supplier. Check with your insurance company before purchasing or renting a nebulizer to ensure it will be covered. Your health care provider should be able to assist you with these arrangements. To use a nebulizer, you will need the following supplies: Air compressor Nebulizer cup Mask or mouthpiece Medication (either unit dose vials or bottles with measuring devices) Compressor tubing Once you have the necessary supplies: Place the air compressor on a sturdy surface that will support its weight. Plug the cord from the compressor into a properly grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet. Before asthma treatment, wash your hands with soap and water and dry completely. Carefully measure medications exactly as you have been instructed and put them into the nebulizer cup. Most medications today come in premeasured unit dose vials so measuring is not necessary. If you do measure, use a separate, clean measuring device for each medication. Assemble the nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece. Connect the tubing to both the aerosol compressor and nebulizer cup. Turn on the compressor to make sure it is working correctly. You should see a light mist coming from the back of the tube opposite the mouthpiece. Sit up straight on a comfortable chair. If the treatment is for your child, he or she may sit on your lap. If you are using a mask, position it comfortably and securely on your or your child\'s face. If you are using a mouthpiece, place it between your or your child\'s teeth and seal the lips around it. Take slow, deep breaths. If possible, hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before breathing out. This allows the medication to settle into the airways. Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (an average of 10 minutes). The nebulizer will make a sputtering noise, and the cup will have just a little medication remaining. If dizziness or jitteriness occurs, stop the treatment and rest for about 5 minutes. Continue the treatment, and try to breathe more slowly. If dizziness or jitteriness continues to be a problem with future treatments, inform your health care provider. During the treatment, if the medication sticks to the sides of the nebulizer cup, you may shake the cup to loosen the droplets. Your pediatrician should tell you the frequency of nebulizer use and how long you should use it. You should also be given an asthma action plan that explains which medications to use and when. Using a portable nebulizer is similar to using a home nebulizer, except that you don\'t need to plug it in. Most models are small enough to hold in your hand during use. Cleaning Cleaning and disinfecting your asthma nebulizer equipment is simple and very important. Proper care prevents infection. Cleaning should be done in a dust- and smoke-free area away from open windows. Follow these instructions when cleaning your nebulizer: After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess water, and let air dry. At the end of each day, the nebulizer cup, mask, or mouthpiece should be washed in warm soapy water using a mild detergent, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to air dry. You do not need to clean the compressor tubing. Every third day, after washing your equipment, disinfect the equipment using either a vinegar/water solution or the disinfectant solution your equipment supplier suggests. To use the vinegar solution, mix 1/2 cup white vinegar with 1 1/2 cups of water. Soak the equipment for 20 minutes and rinse well under a steady stream of water. Shake off the excess water and allow to air dry on a paper towel. Always allow the equipment to completely dry before storing in a plastic, zippered bag. Storing Cover the compressor with a clean cloth when not in use. Keep it clean by wiping it with a clean, damp cloth as needed. Do not put the air compressor on the floor either for treatments or for storage. Medications should be stored in a cool, dry place. Some medications require refrigeration and some require protection from light. Check them often. \x1b[92m[14] If they have changed color or formed crystals, throw them away and replace them with new ones.\x1b[0m Other Tips Always have an extra nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece in case you need it.

Take your meds exactly as your doctor prescribed. Review possible side effects. Most reactions will occur when you start a new medication, but this isn't always the case. They might be delayed or might happen when you add another drug. Don't stop treatment unless you talk to your doctor first or you have a serious side effect. Call him or her as soon as possible if you feel you need to stop the medication. If you quit too early, the illness might return or become harder to treat. Don't double the dose unless your doctor says to. If you miss a dose, don't panic. Take it as soon as you remember. But if it's almost time for your next dose, skip the one you missed and go back to your schedule. Don't keep medication that's outdated or no longer needed. Store it in a dry area away from moisture, unless the doctor or pharmacist tells you to refrigerate it. Always keep medications out of the reach of children. Contact your doctor right away if you have any unusual side effects. Don't share your medications with others. If you store your medications in a container, label it with the drug name, dose, frequency, and expiration date. Know when your medications will run out. Renew you prescriptions as you need them. Buy your medications at the same pharmacy, if you can. When you travel, don't pack medications in your checked baggage. Keep them in your carry-on bag so you'll have them if your luggage gets lost. Take extra doses with you when you travel in case your flight is delayed and you need to stay away longer than planned. If you have any questions about your medication, ask your doctor.

Practice Self-Care ', ""https://www.webmd.com/depression/summer-depression\nAh, the joys of summer: The withering heat and school vacations, when your kids give you minute-to-minute updates on their boredom levels. Isn't summer supposed to be fun and relaxing? If you've got summer depression, it isn't. For some people, summer depression has a biological cause, says Ian A. Cook, MD, the director of the Depression Research Program at UCLA. For others, the particular stresses of summer can pile up and make them feel miserable. Especially hard is that you feel like you're supposed to be having a great time. Everyone else seems so happy splashing in the water and sweating in their lawn chairs. So why can't you? And more importantly, what can you do to make this summer easier? Here's what you need to know about summer depression. Why do some people feel more depressed in summer? Here's a rundown of reasons. Summertime SAD. You've probably heard about seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, which affects about 4% to 6% of the U. S. population. SAD typically causes depression as the days get shorter and colder. But about 10% of people with SAD get it in the reverse -- the onset of summer triggers their depression symptoms. Cook notes that some studies have shown that in countries near the equator â   such as India â   summer SAD is more common than winter SAD. Why do seasonal changes cause depression? Experts aren't sure, but the longer days, and increasing heat and humidity may play a role. Specific symptoms of summer depression often include loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, weight loss, and anxiety. Disrupted schedules in summer. If you've had depression before, you probably know that having a reliable routine is often key to staving off symptoms. But during the summer, routine goes out the window â   and that disruption can be stressful, Cook says. If you have children in grade school, you're suddenly faced with the prospect of keeping them occupied all day, every day. If your kids are in college, you may suddenly find them â   and all their boxes of stuff â   back in the house after a nine-month absence. Vacations can disrupt your work, sleep, and eating habits â   all of which can all contribute to summer depression. Body image issues. As the temperature climbs and the layers of clothing fall away, a lot of people feel terribly self-conscious about their bodies, says Cook. Feeling embarrassed in shorts or a bathing suit can make life awkward, not to mention hot. Since so many summertime gatherings revolve around beaches and pools, some people start avoiding social situations out of embarrassment. Financial worries. Summers can be expensive. There's the vacation, of course. And if you're a working parent, you may have to fork over a lot of money to summer camps or babysitters to keep your kids occupied while you're on the job. The expenses can add to a feeling of summer depression. â   This summer, we have worries about the economic crisis layered on top of everything else,â   says Cook. â   People are feeling more financially strapped. \x1b[92m[1] They're wondering, â   If I go on vacation, will the job still be there when I get back?\x1b[0m 'â   The heat. Lots of people relish the sweltering heat. They love baking on a beach all day. But for the people who don't, summer heat can become truly oppressive. You may start spending every weekend hiding out in your air-conditioned bedroom, watching Pay- Per- View until your eyes ache. You may begin to skip your usual before-dinner walks because of the humidity. You may rely on unhealthy takeout because it's just too stifling to cook. Any of these things can contribute to summer depression. What can help you feel better? What can you do to make this summer different? Here are some tips on taking control of summer depression. Get help. It's simple. If you think you're getting depressed, no matter what time of year, get help. Talk to a therapist, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Or see your general medical doctor or a psychiatrist who can evaluate whether medicines for depression might be appropriate. Never take the signs of depression lightly. Don't wait them out, assuming they'll resolve. Sometimes, what started as summer depression can turn into a longer-lasting bout of major depression, Cook tells Web MD. And even if your depression will resolve in September, that's no reason to ignore it in June. We're talking about three months of potentially avoidable misery. â   A temporary depression can still be pretty awful,â   says Cook. While the symptoms lift in a few months, the impact on your family and job can be permanent. Plan ahead. Cook says there's one advantage to a summer depression: you know when it's coming. June is right there on the calendar. So if you're feeling OK in the spring, think about the specific aspects of your life that become difficult during the summer. What will help prevent summer depression? What's the best way to take time off from work? Would signing up the kids for summer programs or camp help relieve your stress? You'll feel a lot more in control heading into the summer if you have plans in place. Sleep. Vacations, summer barbecues, the short nights â   they can all encourage you to stay up later than usual. But not getting enough sleep is a common trigger for depression. So make a concerted effort to get to bed on time. Keep up with your exercise. Many studies have found that regular physical activity can help keep depression at bay. So even if it's getting too hot for your normal activities, find other ways to stay active and head off summer depression. Start earlier in the morning or later in the evening, when it's not so hot. Consider fitness equipment for the cool basement. If an annual membership to a gym is too expensive, consider joining one for a couple of months just to get you through the summer. Don't overdo dieting and fitness. Don't kick off the summer with a frenzy of dieting and exercise in order to fit into last year's bathing suit. It's bound to make you unhappy and anxious. Instead, exercise sensibly and eat moderately. If you try an insanely restrictive diet, you probably won't be able to keep it up. And that â  failureâ   will just leave you more demoralized and worsen your summer depression. Protect yourself. Don't let obligations drag you down. Maybe you always host the enormous family barbecue on Memorial Day or the July 4 picnic. But if you're feeling overwhelmed, give it a pass this year. Ask another relative to host. Don't risk pushing yourself into a summer depression just to live up to tradition. Think about why. If you struggle with summer depression year after year, ask yourself if there's a reason. Do you associate summer with a difficult time in the past â   the death of a loved one or the break-up of a relationship? Have you had previous bouts of depression during the summer? Without even realizing it, you may have started to associate the summer with sadness â   an association that gets stronger every summer that you spend depressed. If you do have some unhappy connection with the summer, sorting it out could help you break the cycle. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your medication. If you're on medicine for depression, and you find that summer â   year after year â   makes your depression worse, talk to your doctor about changing your dosage. Maybe he or she could up your dose in the late spring and taper it back down in the fall. It could really help head off summer depression problems, Cook says. Plan your vacation carefully. Before you book your plane tickets or load up your car's roof rack for your annual summer vacation, ask yourself this: Is this what you really want? Or is it an obligation you're fulfilling to a relative? Will it make you happy? Or will it stretch your finances, stress you out, and make you fall behind at work? Consider alternatives. Instead of taking a whole week off at once, might it be better to take off several long weekends spread out through the summer? Would taking time off but staying at home â   a â  staycationâ   â   be more relaxing? \x1b[92m[0] Don't get locked into a vacation that won't feel like a vacation.\x1b[0m Don't beat yourself up. One thing that's hard about summer depression is that you feel so out of step. Everyone else seems to be having such a swell time. You aren't. You keep asking yourself, â   What's wrong with me?â   Try not to think that way. â   So much of our misery grows out of the gap between where we are and where we think we ought to be,â   says Cook. So stop worrying about how you feel relative to other people. Stop assuming that you're supposed to be happy just because the calendar says it's June. Instead, concentrate on what's triggering your summer depression and how you can overcome it. â   Treatments do work,â   says Cook. â   Psychotherapy or medication can blunt the effects of a seasonal depression.

Your healthcare provider can answer questions about side effects specific to your treatment and condition. Who Shouldn't Take Beta-Blockers? Beta-blockers may not be for everyone. They may worsen or negatively affect certain health conditions. \x1b[92m[4] Before you start taking a beta-blocker, let your healthcare provider know if: You have asthma.\x1b[0m You have a condition or take medications that may cause low blood sugar level. You have Raynaud's phenomenon. You have low blood pressure. You have a slow heart rate. You have certain conditions that affect your heart rhythm. \x1b[92m[0] What to Avoid When Taking Beta-Blockers Some medications may negatively affect beta-blockers.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] They may increase the risk of side effects from beta-blockers or affect how well they work.\x1b[0m Let your healthcare provider know if you take: Certain antidepressants, such as Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), and Cymbalta (duloxetine) "", ""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/beta-blockers/\n\x1b[92m[5] Cautions with other medicinesThere are some medicines that may interfere with the way that beta blockers work, including beta blocker eyedrops.Tell your doctor if you're taking:other medicines for high blood pressure.\x1b[0m The combination with beta blockers can sometimes lower your blood pressure too much. This may make you feel dizzy or faintother medicines for an irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone or flecainideother medicines that can lower your blood pressure. These include some antidepressants, nitrates (for chest pain), baclofen (a muscle relaxant), medicines for an enlarged prostate gland like tamsulosin, or Parkinson's disease medicines such as levodopamedicines for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)medicines for diabetes, particularly insulin – beta blockers may make it more difficult to recognise the warning signs of low blood sugarmedicines to treat nose or sinus congestion, or other cold remedies (including those you can buy in the pharmacy)medicines for allergies, such as ephedrine, noradrenaline or adrenalinenon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. \x1b[92m[2] These medicines may increase your blood pressure, so it's best to keep them to a minimum\x1b[0m "", ""https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/heart-failure-beta-blocker\nDrugs called beta-blockers perform four main tasks essential for people with heart failure: Improve your heart's ability to relax Decrease the production of harmful substances your body makes in response to heart failure Slow your heart rate Improve the heart's pumping ability over time If you have heart failure, you need beta-blockers -- even if you do not have symptoms. Beta-blockers are prescribed for patients with systolic heart failure and improve survival, even in people with severe symptoms. There are several types of beta-blockers, but only three are approved by the FDA to treat heart failure: Bisoprolol ( Zebeta) Carvedilol ( Coreg) Metoprolol ( Toprol) They may be taken with meals, at bedtime, or in the morning. Food delays how your body absorbs beta-blockers, but they also may reduce side effects. Follow the directions on the label. Beta-blockers shouldn't be used if you have very low blood pressure (hypotension) or a slow pulse (bradycardia) that may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded. If you have severe lung congestion, your doctor will treat your congestion before prescribing a beta-blocker. While you are taking this beta-blocker, your doctor may tell you to take and record your pulse daily. He'll tell you how rapid your pulse should be. If your pulse is slower than it should be or your blood pressure is less than 100, call your doctor about taking your beta-blocker that day. Never stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor first, even if you feel that it's not working. When you start taking beta-blockers, your heart failure symptoms may become a bit worse while your heart adjusts to the medication. This is normal, but let your doctor or nurse know if you become extremely tired, gain more than 5 pounds, have trouble breathing, or have other signs of congestion or swelling. Once your heart adjusts, you will feel better. Dizziness or lightheadedness: This may be strongest when you get out of bed or get up from a chair. Get up more slowly. Call your doctor or nurse if these symptoms don't go away or are severe. Tiredness, cold hands and feet, headache , nightmares , trouble sleeping, heartburn , diarrhea or constipation , or gas. Call your doctor or nurse if these symptoms don't go away or are severe. Sudden weight gain . Weight gain is common as your doctor increases your medication dose. Call your doctor if you gain 3 or more pounds in 1 day, or if you continue to gain weight for more than 2 days. Increased shortness of breath; wheezing ; trouble breathing; skin rash ; slow, fast, or irregular heartbeat ; swelling of feet and lower legs; chest pain . Call your doctor or nurse right away. Severe vomiting or diarrhea . If you have these, you may become dehydrated, which can lead to low blood pressure. Call your doctor or nurse. Also call your doctor or nurse if you have any other symptoms that cause concern. A beta-blocker is often prescribed with other medications such as a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor ( ARNI), or angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB). If you have side effects after taking your medications together, call your doctor or nurse. You may need to change the times you take each drug. \x1b[92m[1] It's important that your doctor be aware of all the medications you are taking, as some may interact with beta-blockers.\x1b[0m Talk to your doctor before taking any new drug, including over-the-counter drugs, herbs, and supplements.""]",Should you avoid taking certain drugs while taking beta-blockers?,"Yes, when taking beta-blockers, it's crucial to avoid certain drugs due to potential adverse interactions [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.

Chronic pain that develops after an operation is often known as ‘chronic or persistent post-surgical pain’. Knowing when pain becomes chronic after surgery is especially difficult because many people have had their surgery to treat a painful condition, such as a painful hernia or a long-standing back problem.

All the things they do with their mouths -- groom, kiss, wrestle, and other social habits -- can pass along unwanted guests to playmates and companions, canine and human alike. Parasites worm their way into most dogs’ lives at one time or another. Your vet may suspect worms if your dog has diarrhea or is vomiting, coughing, chewing or licking under his tail, short of breath, or losing weight.

If it’s time for your dog’s annual check-up, or if you or your vet thinks your dog has worms, provide a fresh stool sample. Simply scoop up some of your pet’s poop, seal it in a clean plastic bag, and bring it to the appointment. If you can't do that, your vet can take a sample during the office visit. He'll check it under a microscope to see if it has worms or worm eggs, and, if so, what kind. \x1b[92m[12] Heartworms are another type of canine invader that can cause serious health problems or sometimes even death.\x1b[0m These foot-long worms live in the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Mosquitoes carry the worms’ offspring from one dog’s blood to another’s. The vet will do a blood test to tell if your dog has heartworms. There are many safe ways to de-worm your dog. The sooner the worms are gone, the sooner your pet will get healthy and feel better. Your vet will give your dog medicine by mouth or in a shot to kill the worms. Many of these drugs are described as “broad-spectrum,” because they're good for treating a wide range of parasites, including worms that live in the gut. They're poisonous to pests, but safe for pets. Because worms are so common in puppies, vets recommend de-worming them for the first time when they're 2 to 3 weeks old. Worms can pass from mother to baby before birth or soon after, through her milk. It will take more than one dose. The first round kills the worms that are there at the time. The second kills those that hatch a few weeks later. Rarely, your vet may want to give your puppy blood, because hookworms drain blood from the wall of the intestines, which can cause anemia. \x1b[92m[3] Treatment is much the same for adult dogs with worms.\x1b[0m The same kinds of drugs are used, but your dog will get more of the medicine. If your dog has heartworms, your vet will need to do blood work, take X-rays, and maybe do other tests to see how serious the infection is. Just the tests can cost $1,000 or more, but they're necessary. Initially, your dog will be started on monthly heartworm prevention along with an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory. A month later, the heartworm treatment starts. This is a strong medicine that should only be given by a vet. Typically, your dog gets a series of three shots over a 2-month period. But that’s not the end of the treatment. You'll need to keep your dog calm and quiet for several months after the shots. When heartworms die they break into pieces. These chunks can block blood from flowing to the heart or lungs. When that happens -- and there is a greater chance when blood pumps harder, such as during exercise -- a dog could die. Your vet will give you tips to make sure your sick dog gets rest so he can recover safely. Six months after the heartworm treatment, your vet will do a blood test to check for worms. If they're still there, your dog will need another round of shots. If they're all gone, you continue the preventive medicine for the rest of your dog’s life and test for heartworms each year. The best way to protect your pet is to control the pests that carry worms, including fleas and mosquitoes, and keep your home and yard clean. You'll be doing yourself a favor, too, because some types of worms can be passed to humans. Follow these simple steps to ward off worms: Make sure your vet checks your dog for all kinds of worms at least once a year (two to four times for puppies). Keep your dog flea-free. You can buy flea collars or medicine to put on your dog’s skin. There are also flea control treatments that you can give to your dog by mouth. \x1b[92m[4] Get a prescription from your vet for the drug to prevent heartworms, and give it to your dog once a month.\x1b[0m Never skip a dose. Ask your vet about an injection that can be given to your dog every six months, called Pro Heart. Practice the four Ps: Pick up (and throw away) Pet Poop Promptly. Clear your yard at least weekly and scoop up after your dog when you go for a walk. Wash your hands often, including after you pet animals and especially after picking up their waste. If you’re worried about catching worms from dogs, don't let them lick or kiss you or your kids.

Then again, like the parents in that study, you may just think they’re being hyper just because you know that they consumed sugar. Tips for parents Even though most kids don’t have a sugar sensitivity, that doesn’t mean sugar is good for their health. Sugary foods and beverages deliver calories without any nutrients. What’s more, eating foods high in added sugars throughout childhood is linked to the development of risk factors for heart disease, such as an increased risk of obesity and elevated blood pressure in children and young adults.

There are also CDC-recognized lifestyle change programs that provide structured support from a trained lifestyle coach and support groups in person or online. Programs are year-long and focus on making long-term changes. Dr. Van Name also recommends starting with simple interventions at home and expanding on them over time, especially when working with children. 'With kids, we don’t expect a total 180,' she says. 'A family can help by figuring out what will motivate a child.' \x1b[92m[5] The interventions might include pursuing more physical activity as a family or trying different-colored foods on the dinner plate, she adds.\x1b[0m 'If much of the food on your plate is green, that's great. But if it’s all a beige color, it's often a less-healthy meal,' Dr. Van Name says. 'Managing stress, which can be a roadblock, is also important.' What if lifestyle changes don’t lead to weight loss?If adults and children have difficulty changing lifestyle habits themselves, there are options, including a variety of types of weight-loss surgery (which in itself has been shown to reverse type 2 diabetes) and medications. Some doctors prescribe metformin, a front-line medication for type 2 diabetes, 'off-label' for prediabetes (meaning doctors prescribe it for a condition even though the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] hasn’t specifically approved it for that condition). 'Metformin is a good tool,' Dr. Anam says, adding that studies have shown the drug can decrease the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, although to a lesser degree than lifestyle changes.

When introducing foods with added sugars, pair them with protein, healthy fat or fiber. This helps to blunt the effects of blood sugar surges and drops, and it optimizes satiety.

Inflammation is when a part of your body is swollen and hot. It can also be painful. \x1b[92m[4] Most of the time, cystitis happens when there's an infection caused by bacteria.\x1b[0m This is called a urinary tract infection (UTI). Having a bladder infection can be painful and annoying. It can become a serious health problem if the infection spreads to your kidneys. Cystitis also may occur as a reaction to certain drugs or radiation therapy. Things that sometimes irritate the bladder, such as hygiene products, spermicide jelly or long-term catheter use, can also lead to cystitis. Cystitis can also happen as a complication of another illness. "", ""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371306\nBacterial cystitisUTIs typically occur when bacteria outside the body enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to multiply. Most cases of cystitis are caused by a type of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. But other types of bacteria can cause infections, too. Bacterial bladder infections may happen in women after sex. Even in those who aren't sexually active, UTIs can happen because the female genital area often harbors bacteria that can cause cystitis. \x1b[92m[5] Noninfectious cystitisAlthough bacterial infections are the most common cause of cystitis, a number of noninfectious factors also may cause the bladder to become inflamed.\x1b[0m Some examples include: Interstitial cystitis.

This is because women have a shorter urethra (the tube where urine leaves the body,) and it's closer to the anus. Women are more likely to get an infection after sex or during and after menopause. A fever is the most common sign of a bladder infection. True False Answer: The correct answer is false. People with a bladder infection do not have a fever. \x1b[92m[2] More common symptoms include cloudy or bloody urine, pain or burning when you urinate, pressure or cramps in the lower stomach or back, or feeling like you need to urinate often.\x1b[0m Call your doctor if you think you have a bladder infection.

You make countless trips to the bathroom, and still you feel like you have to go again. And once you're in there, instead of mindlessly going about your business, you feel burning or stinging every time you pee. When you get a bladder infection, it leads to cystitis, which is when your bladder swells and gets irritated. That's what causes the symptoms. A bladder infection is the most common type of urinary tract infection ( UTI). Here are the parts of your urinary tract and what they do: Your kidneysclean waste from your blood and make pee. Your ureters are thin tubes, one for each kidney, that carry pee to your bladder. Your bladder stores pee. Your urethra carries pee from the bladder to outside your body. Women get bladder infections much more than men do. \x1b[92m[6] Usually, the infections are more annoying than they are serious, and antibiotics are the treatment.\x1b[0m But they can travel up the ureters to the kidneys and cause more severe problems, so it's important to treat them right away. The main culprits are bacteria, usually E. coli. These bacteria live on your skin and in your intestines and most of the time, they're not a problem. Everyone has them. But if they get into the urethra, they can end up in the bladder and cause an infection. Bladder infections are more common in women than men for several reasons. A woman's urethra is shorter than a man's, and it's close to the vagina and anus, where bacteria live. Having sex, wiping from back to front after you go to the bathroom, putting in a tampon, and using a diaphragm for birth control are all ways bacteria can get in. During pregnancy, the baby can press on your bladder, which prevents it from emptying completely and gives bacteria a place to thrive. After menopause, women have less of the hormone estrogen. That causes the lining of the urethra to get thinner and may change the balance of bacteria in the vagina, making infections more likely. When men get them, a prostate infection usually is the cause. But any blockage -- like from a bladder stone or enlarged prostate -- can prevent the bladder from totally emptying and cause infection.""]",What happens when you get a bladder infection?,"When you get a bladder infection, typically caused by bacteria, you may experience symptoms such as a burning sensation during urination, a frequent urge to urinate, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and pelvic discomfort [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m.

', 'https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/laparoscopic-proctosigmoidectomy\nThis operation removes a diseased section of the rectum and sigmoid colon. Doctors use it to treat the following conditions: Cancers of the colon and rectum Some types of noncancerous growths in the colon and rectum Complicated diverticulitis The term ""laparoscopic"" refers to a type of surgery called laparoscopy, in which the surgeon works through very small (5-millimeter to 10-millimeter) ""keyhole"" cuts in the abdomen. A laparoscope is a small telescope-like instrument. Your surgeon will use it in order to see inside you during the operation. There are five main steps to this surgery. First, you\'ll get general anesthesia so that you\'re â  asleep.â   Then your surgeon will make a small cut (about half an inch) near your bellybutton and place the laparoscope through it so he can see images from inside you. Once the laparoscope is in place, the surgeon will make five or six more small (5-10 millimeter) cuts to make room for the surgical tools. Your surgeon will need to cut away the diseased section of your sigmoid colon and rectum. But first, he must free this section from what supports it. The bowel is attached to the abdominal wall by a layer of tissue called the mesentery, which also contains the main blood vessels (arteries) that take blood to the left side of the colon and rectum. Your surgeon will cut and close them. Then he\'ll free the sigmoid colon and part of the rectum from the mesentery, and cut away the diseased tissue. Later, he\'ll remove this part of the mesentery with the diseased bowel. The surgeon must rejoin the remaining end of the descending colon with the remaining end of the rectum. First, he will detach a part of the healthy descending colon from the mesentery so that he can stretch it toward the rectum. He\'ll also free the rectum from its mesentery so it can meet the end of the colon. To reduce the risk of cancer cells spreading, the surgeon will wash the rectum with a special solution. The cuts used in laparoscopy are very small, so the surgeon must remove the diseased section of bowel in a special way. He will enlarge one of the cuts and place a bag into your abdominal cavity, put the diseased bowel into the bag, and then pull the bag out of the enlarged cut. To do this, your surgeon will use a special stapling device he places into the rectum. Doctors call this rejoining of the colon and rectum an anastomosis. The stapling device ""fires"" a ring of staples to connect the two ends. The surgeon will check the anastomosis for leaks and rinse out your pelvis. Your surgeon may place a drain into your abdomen for a few days to help you recover after surgery. And he will stitch or tape close all the surgical cuts. \x1b[92m[0] You should avoid heavy lifting and abdominal exercises such as sit-ups for 6 weeks after the surgery.\x1b[0m Apart from that, you should steadily build up your activity level when you get home. Walking is a great exercise choice. It will help your recovery by making you stronger, keeping your blood circulating to prevent blood clots, and helping your lungs remain clear. Did you work out before the surgery? You can get back to exercising when you feel comfortable and your doctor says it\'s OK. When you go home, you\'ll be able to eat almost everything except raw fruits and vegetables. You should continue this â  softâ   diet until your post-surgical check-up. If the diet makes you constipated, call your doctor\'s office for advice.']",When can I be active after laparoscopic proctosigmoidectomy?,"After a laparoscopic proctosigmoidectomy, most patients can resume light activities within a few days, but it's crucial to follow your surgeon's specific advice.

Women who receive LEEP often spend less than an hour at their gynecologist's office for the procedure and may experience side effects such as cramping and light bleeding. LEEP replaced several invasive and potentially dangerous cervical cancer treatments, providing a quick and inexpensive way to remove women's pre-cancerous cervical cells before they progress to cervical cancer.

The tissue is then sent to a laboratory for further analysis. Why do I need a LEEP? There are a few reasons the doctor may recommend a LEEP: To diagnose precancerous changes in the cervix and cervical cancer (precancer refers to abnormal cells that could become cancer) To figure out the cause of an abnormal Pap test result To treat precancerous conditions and early-stage cancer in the cervix How to prepare for a LEEP ', 'https://screening.iarc.fr/colpochap.php?lang=1&chap=13.php\n\x1b[92m[12] Electrosurgery is the use of radiofrequency electric current to cut tissue or achieve haemostasis.\x1b[0m A loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) operator needs to keep in mind that electricity flows to ground along the path of the least electrical resistance. The electrical energy used in electrosurgery is transformed into heat and light energy. The heat from a high-voltage electrical arc between the operating electrode and tissue allows the practitioner to cut by vaporizing tissue (at 100oC) or to coagulate by dehydrating tissue (above 100oC). The cutting electrodes are loops of very fine (0.2 mm) stainless steel or tungsten wire to achieve different widths, depths, and configurations of cut (Figure 13.1).

To remove abnormal cells, doctors may perform: Cryotherapy, during which abnormal cells in the cervix are frozen. Laser ablation. Doctors may use a CO2 laser to vaporize abnormal cervical cells. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). \x1b[92m[10] For this treatment, doctors surgically remove the abnormal tissue using a wire loop that has a high-frequency electrical current running through it.\x1b[0m Many doctors prefer this treatment for cervical dysplasia, because abnormal cells are less likely to recur, compared to cryotherapy or laser ablation.

The generator transmits a painless electric current that allows the abnormal cells to be cut away from the normal cells. \x1b[92m[3] Why is a LEEP needed?This procedure is used to remove the portion of the cervix containing pre-cancerous cells.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] It is usually done after you have had an abnormal Pap smear or colposcopy, when your provider looks at your cervix with a colposcope (similar to a microscope).\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.verywellhealth.com/loop-electrosurgical-excision-leep-procedure-3521075\nAfter a LEEP, there is also a small increase in the risk of future pregnancy complications, including premature birth and having a low-birth-weight baby. This may be due to cervical dysplasia itself. \x1b[92m[4] Purpose of a LEEP Procedure A LEEP is typically done when a Pap smear or a colposcopy suggests the presence of abnormal cervical cells or cervical dysplasia.\x1b[0m Cervical dysplasia may be a precursor to cervical cancer and is often caused by a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The good news is that when cervical dysplasia is identified and treated early, most women do not go on to develop cancer. While a LEEP can remove abnormal cervical cells, it is not a cure for HPV. Even if the cells are cleared, you will still have HPV and require ongoing monitoring to ensure that any abnormal cells are treated promptly if and when they emerge.

You may also get one if your doctor found something unusual during an examination of your vagina. Doctors use LEEP to diagnose or treat abnormal things, including cells that look like they might become cancer. Before you agree to get one, make sure your doctor explains: Why they want you to have one What the results could mean What the risks, benefits, and complications could be Who will do it If there are other options A LEEP usually takes about 10 to 20 minutes. In most cases, you can have it done at your doctor's office. You'll lie on the exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to open your vagina, as if you were getting a Pap smear. Your doctor will look at your cervix and the inside of your vagina using something called a colposcope. It looks a little bit like a microscope, and it lets your doctor look at the cells close up. Your doctor will put it near your vagina, but not inside. To get a good look at the cells, your doctor may clean and soak your cervix with a vinegary liquid. It can make abnormal cells turn white and make them easier to see. It may sting a little. Then you'll get a small shot in the area to numb it. Next, your doctor will put the LEEP tool through the speculum into your vagina and take out abnormal tissue. How much your doctor takes depends on whether they're using the LEEP to figure out what's wrong or to treat the problem. During the LEEP, you may feel cramps or like there is pressure inside. Some women feel faint. Tell your doctor if you get lightheaded or you feel like you might pass out. You'll be able to go home right after it's done. The tool closes up your blood vessels, so there shouldn't be much bleeding. Your doctor will put medicine on the area to stop what little bleeding there is. The medication can cause a dark discharge or spotting for a few days. Your doctor will probably give you instructions for when you go home.

Gestational diabetes is diabetes that occurs in pregnant women. \x1b[92m[0] It means that your blood sugar level is too high.\x1b[0m During pregnancy, certain hormones cause this to happen. While any pregnant woman can potentially develop gestational diabetes, it is more likely in women who are overweight, have a family history of diabetes or have had history of a baby weighing more than 9 pounds at birth. Additionally, if you have had gestational diabetes in the past or had pre-diabetes before your pregnancy, you are more likely than other women to develop gestational diabetes.

Insulin is used by the body to store and utilize glucose. Gestational diabetes is defined as glucose intolerance during pregnancy. During your pregnancy, hormonal changes can cause the body to be less sensitive to the effect of insulin.

Some women have undiagnosed diabetes or prediabetes that they and their medical providers did not know they had prior to becoming pregnant. In this case, it can be difficult to determine whether the mother had been diabetic or is experiencing gestational diabetes, but treatment during pregnancy is the same: controlling blood sugars to the same goals with lifestyle changes or medication. Pregnancy is a time when women are naturally more insulin resistant - their prepregnancy metabolism has to adjust to the nutrients required for their growing baby Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas, the organ that produces insulin, cannot quite make enough insulin to keep blood sugars normal during pregnancy.

People with weak immune systems and older adults have a higher risk of getting shingles. Symptoms include itching or burning on one side of your face or body at first, followed by a painful rash made up of blisters (about 1 to 14 days after the initial pain starts). The pain can last for long periods, days, weeks or even years. \x1b[92m[1] There is no cure for shingles, so treatment is aimed at managing pain and related problems.\x1b[0m If the rash affects your face, it can put your eyesight or hearing at risk. If you've had chickenpox and are age 50 or over, you should talk to your doctor about possible preventive steps, such as the shingles vaccine. If you have any signs of shingles, such as pain or itching on one side, or a rash, you should also call your doctor. \x1b[92m[2] Even if you've already seen your doctor for shingles, you should get medical care right away if the rash starts to spread to your face.\x1b[0m "", 'https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/shingles\nYour doctor probably will start treatment with antiviral medicines. \x1b[92m[0] If you start taking medicines within the first 3 days of seeing the shingles rash, you have a lower chance of having later problems, such as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).\x1b[0m Early treatment can also reduce how long your symptoms last and how severe they are. It also can prevent lasting eye damage. If you have pain that lasts longer than 3 months after your shingles rash heals, your doctor may diagnose post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). Treatment to reduce pain from PHN includes: Anti-seizure medicines, such as gabapentin or pregabalin. Antidepressant medicines, such as amitriptyline. Numbing medicines that are put on the skin, such as capsaicin and lidocaine. Other medicines that help treat pain.

While some chronic knee conditions cannot be cured, treatments can help reduce your symptoms and pain. Common Causes of Knee Pain Knee and joint pain can be caused by a host of acute injuries, medical conditions and chronic diseases. Common Knee Injuries "", ""https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/q-a-knee-pain\nYour knee hurts and you want to know why. Whether it's an injury or arthritis, here are answers from Joseph Bosco, MD. He's an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in sports medicine and knee care at the NYU Langone Medical Center's Hospital for Joint Diseases. Could my pain be from osteoarthritis? Yes. Probably 95% of knee pain caused by arthritis is osteoarthritis, which is caused by â  wear and tearâ   on the joints. Other types, like rheumatoid arthritis, are much less common causes of knee pain. What kind of injuries can cause knee pain? They're usually twisting injuries to the knee: ACL, meniscus, or ligament injuries. What's the difference? The main difference between arthritis and other kinds of knee pain is there's no trauma associated with it. A person who tore their ACL or had a meniscus injury knows exactly when it happened. With arthritis, it's more of a dull, aching pain. It gets worse as time goes on. Will my pain go away on its own? It depends. Arthritis pain tends to wax and wane over time. It may not completely go away, but sometimes it feels much better. Pain from an injury improves at first, but if you're left with a sore joint, you may not be able to do certain activities. When do I need to see a doctor? Everyone has a different pain threshold. If you've an injury and your knee swells, you need to see your doctor. Even if the swelling goes away, you need to have your knee examined -- you might have injured something inside the joint. \x1b[92m[0] If you have arthritis pain and the bad days outnumber the good, you should see your doctor.\x1b[0m How do I keep my knees healthy? I think weight control is important. Flexibility helps as well. If you take part in a sport that requires a lot of physical exertion, like skiing or tennis or soccer, you need to get in shape. Also, when you get tired, you need to stop. Look at the rate of knee injury: It goes up in the fourth quarter or final period of a game. Just a millisecond or two of delay of muscle function can cause injury. If the muscles that protect the ligament are tired, they don't do a good job.""]",When do I need to see a doctor about my knee pain?,"You should see a doctor about your knee pain if it persists for more than a few days, is severe or worsening, or is accompanied by swelling, redness, or warmth around the joint [92m[0][0m.

How to Find the Right ADHD Medication Dosage for You Top ADHD Resources for Adults 19 Sources "", ""https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/multimodal-treatment-for-adhd\nADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and the inability to control impulses. It affects an estimated 5.2 million school-age children in the U. S. Everyone, especially younger children, may have symptoms of ADHD from time to time. But with ADHD, the ability to function with daily activities is affected. A diagnosis of ADHD can be hard to make, and evaluation must be made by a specialist. There are several different approaches to treating ADHD. \x1b[92m[1] But research suggests that for many children, the best way to manage the symptoms is a multimodal approach.\x1b[0m Multimodal treatment involves multiple methods of treatment that work together to help a child with ADHD. The main components of this approach are medications, behavioral therapy, and education. The most commonly prescribed medications for ADHD are stimulants. These include: Amphetamine ( Adzenys XR- ODT) Amphetamine/ Dextroamphetamine ( Adderall, Adderall XR) Dexmethylphenidate ( Focalin, Focalin XR) Dextroamphetamine ( Dexedrine or Dextrostat) Lisdexamfetamine ( Vyvanse) Methylphenidate ( Concerta, Daytrana, Metadate, Methylin, Quillivant XR, Ritalin) Some of these drugs may be available in longer-acting formulations. Non-stimulant medications used to treat ADHD, include: Atomoxetine ( Strattera) Clonidine ER ( Kapvay) Guanfacine ER ( Intuniv) ADHD medications are used to improve children's ability to concentrate and work. \x1b[92m[0] Sometimes, a doctor must prescribe different medications or different dosages before finding the best treatment for a child.\x1b[0m Doctors and parents need to carefully monitor children taking medications for ADHD. Side effects of ADHD medicines can include: Anxiety Decreased appetite Fatigue Irritability Sleeping difficulties Skin discoloration (with patches) Upset stomach Most side effects are minor and improve with time. In some cases, doctors may lower a medication dosage to relieve side effects. The FDA recommends that a thorough medical history and exam, including an evaluation of underlying heart or psychiatric problems, be done as part of an ADHD treatment plan. A higher risk of strokes, heart attacks, and sudden death among patients with existing heart conditions has been linked to use of ADHD medications. An increased risk of psychiatric problems has also been linked to ADHD medications. The FDA has recently given approval to a device called Monach external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (e TNS) System to treat chilren age 7 to 12 years old. the cell phone-sized device delivers mild stimulation to electrodes which are attached to a patch worn on the oatient's forehead. Those electrical pulses interact with the part of the brain which is believed to be responsible for ADHD. Behavioral therapy is designed to help a child curb problematic behaviors. This may involve helping the child learn to organize time and activities. Or it could help a child complete homework. It may also involve helping the child control his or her impulses and responses to emotional stimuli. Educating parents about the disorder and its management is another important part of ADHD treatment. For parents, this may include learning parenting skills to help the child manage his or her behavior. That would involve skills such as giving positive feedback for desirable behaviors, ignoring undesirable behaviors, and giving time-outs when the child's behavior is out of control. In some cases, the child's entire family may be involved in this part of the treatment. Treatment guidelines call for behavior therapy as the preferred treatment for preschool children with ADHD. Medicine may be prescribed if further treatment is needed. For older children with ADHD, age 6 and older, an approach that includes both behavior therapy and medication is preferred. Researchers have found that multimodal treatment was particularly effective for improving social skills in children in highly stressful environments. It also was effective for those with anxiety and depression in addition to ADHD. Children who receive multimodal treatment may need lower doses of medications compared to children only receiving medication. A multimodal plan is effective for most children. The particular therapy and medication, however, will vary depending on the individual child. Doctors, parents, and teachers need to work together to develop and administer the best treatment for each child and family.""]",Will I have to try several medications before my child's ADHD symptoms disappear?,"It's common for managing ADHD in children to require trying different medications or dosages to find what works best [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.

For most of us it means a couple of weeks out of work or school, then life goes back to normal. But the flu can be serious, even deadly, if you have a health condition like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, or a weakened immune system. The trick is not to get sick in the first place. Here are proven ways to avoid the flu. Experts say the single best way to avoid the flu is to get the flu shot as soon as you can. The ideal time is early fall. But any time during the winter is fine if you haven\'t already done it. The vaccine is designed to protect against the flu strains health experts believe will be most widespread each season -- for example, the H1 N1 ""swine flu."" Some vaccines work against three flu strains -- you might hear them called trivalent. Others guard against four strains -- doctors will call them quadrivalent. The flu ""shot"" contains a dead virus. One kind that\'s approved for people 6 months and older goes straight into the muscle. Another uses a smaller needle that only goes into the top layer of your skin. It\'s available for people ages 18 to 64. The nasal spray, Flu Mist, contains a live but weakened form of the virus. It\'s approved for those between ages 2 and 49 who are healthy, not allergic to the flu vaccine, and not pregnant. It will again be recommended for the 2018-19 flu season. Egg-free vaccines are for people between ages 18 and 49 who have severe egg allergies. \x1b[92m[15] If your allergy is severe, you should get the flu shot from a doctor who can treat a severe allergic reaction -- either at your doctor\'s office, a hospital, a clinic, or a health department.\x1b[0m Many children with egg allergies are at risk for complications from the flu, so it\'s important for them to get the flu shot. Fluzone is a high-dose version for those ages 65 and older. It\'s better at protecting an older person\'s immune system. There is a â  needle-lessâ   option for people ages 18 to 64: the jet injector vaccine with Afluria, which uses a tool and high pressure to deliver the vaccine. Don\'t make excuses for skipping your flu shot. Your arm might be a little sore the next day. And you may feel a little achy or run a low fever afterward. But you can\'t catch the flu from the vaccine. It contains a weakened or killed form of the virus. It\'s easy to catch the flu. \x1b[92m[5] When a nearby sick person sneezes or coughs, they send out a spray of virus-laden droplets straight to your open mouth or nose.\x1b[0m You can also pick it up from touching a surface -- like the restaurant table where a sick person dined before you. Flu germs can linger on places like tables, counters, desks, doorknobs, and faucets for up to 8 hours. When you touch a germy surface and put your hands on your eyes, nose, or mouth, your fingers bring the virus right into your body. You can try to avoid sick people, but that\'s not always easy to do, especially when you\'re in close quarters like movie theaters and malls. If you can\'t steer clear of the virus, at least use good hygiene to create a barrier against flu germs. Wash your hands with warm water and soap every time you shake hands or touch a surface that might be germ-covered. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you for times when you can\'t get to a sink. Bring along disinfectant wipes to clean any surfaces you\'re about to touch. Take extra care to not touch your mouth, eyes, or nose without washing your hands first. Sharing is wonderful, but not during flu season. Be stingy with your utensils, plates, glasses, and anything else you touch with your mouth. Wash used dishes and utensils in the dishwasher or in the sink with hot water and soap. If you want your immune system to be in good enough shape to fight off the flu and other germs, you need to stay healthy. Eat a balanced diet. Exercise at least 4 days a week. Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. All these will give your body the strength it needs to fend off an influenza attack. In addition to everything else smoking does to your body -- from boosting your cancer risk to giving you premature wrinkles -- it could make you more likely to get the flu. There\'s evidence that smokers get the flu more often than people who don\'t light up. And when they do get sick, smokers tend to have a more severe infection and a higher risk of dying from the flu. Holding off this nasty illness is just one more reason to talk to your doctor about ways to quit smoking. All these steps should keep you pretty well armed against the flu. Still, even the best defense isn\'t perfect. In case you do get sick, ask your doctor about antiviral flu drugs like oseltamivir ( Tamiflu), peramivir ( Rapivab), and zanamivir ( Relenza). They can help you get better faster. But you need to take them within the first 2 days of getting sick. If you do come down with the flu this season, look out for others. You can spread it for up to a week after you get sick. Don\'t share germs with your friends, family, and co-workers. Stay home until you feel better and your fever has been gone (without the help of medicine) for at least 24 hours. Sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. That way you can\'t pass it around. Toss used tissues after you blow your nose. Don\'t leave them lying around for someone else to find.']",How can you get the flu?,"You can get the flu primarily through exposure to the influenza virus, which spreads when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, releasing droplets into the air that can be inhaled by others nearby [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m[92m[8][0m[92m[9][0m[92m[10][0m[92m[11][0m.

Clinical studies investigating the impact of movement and physical activity on people with MS tend to focus on more mobile individuals, with fewer studies on those with limited mobility; however, physical activity is important, and if possible, should be promoted for all people with MS, irrespective of their disability levels.\x1b[0m In previously inactive people, it is important to start exercise as early as possible after MS diagnosis to reduce long-term disability. Therefore, people with MS should be encouraged and supported to participate in physical activity throughout their MS journey, and to incorporate suitable exercises or stretches into their daily life (Figure 3). Similarly, healthcare providers and stakeholders can create opportunities to promote and embed physical activity within MS care to prevent the negative consequences of inactivity and optimise brain health.

All Rights Reserved.Header Photos by Cynthia Classen, Classen Design©Banner Photo by KKey©Powered by Squarespace "", ""https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/what-is-multiple-sclerosis\nMultiple sclerosis, or MS, is a long-lasting disease that can affect your brain, spinal cord, and the optic nerves in your eyes. It can cause problems with vision, balance, muscle control, and other basic body functions. The effects are often different for everyone who has the disease. Some people have mild symptoms and don't need treatment. Others will have trouble getting around and doing daily tasks. MS happens when your immune system attacks a fatty material called myelin, which wraps around your nerve fibers to protect them. Without this outer shell, your nerves become damaged. Scar tissue may form. The damage means your brain can't send signals through your body correctly. Your nerves also don't work as they should to help you move and feel. As a result, you may have symptoms like: Trouble walking Feeling tired Muscle weakness or spasms Blurred or double vision Numbness and tingling Sexual problems Poor bladder or bowel control Pain Depression Problems focusing or remembering The first symptoms often start between ages 20 and 40. Most people with MS have attacks, also called relapses, when the condition gets noticeably worse. They're usually followed by times of recovery when symptoms improve. For other people, the disease continues to get worse over time. In recent years, scientists have found many new treatments that can often help prevent relapses and slow the disease's effects. Doctors don't know for sure what causes MS, but there are many things that seem to make the disease more likely. People with certain genes may have higher chances of getting it. Smoking also may raise the risk. Some people may get MS after they've had a viral infection -- like the Epstein- Barr virus or the human herpesvirus 6 -- that makes their immune system stop working normally. The infection may trigger the disease or cause relapses. Scientists are studying the link between viruses and MS, but they don't have a clear answer yet. Some studies suggest that vitamin D, which you can get from sunlight, may strengthen your immune system and protect you from MS. Some people with higher chances of getting the disease who move to sunnier regions seem to lower their risk. It can be hard to diagnose MS, since its symptoms can be the same as many other nerve disorders. If your doctor thinks you have it, he'll want you to see a specialist who treats the brain and nervous system, called a neurologist. She'll ask you about your medical history and check you for key signs of nerve damage in your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. There's no single test that can prove you have MS. Your doctor will use a few different ones to check you. These may include: Blood tests to rule out diseases that cause similar symptoms, like Lyme disease and AIDS. Checks of your balance, coordination, vision, and other functions to see how well your nerves are working. A test that makes detailed pictures of the structures in your body, called an MRI. Analysis of the liquid that cushions your brain and spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF). People with MS usually have specific proteins in their CSF. Tests (called evoked potentials) that measure the electrical activity in your brain. There is no cure for MS right now, but a number of treatments can improve how you feel and keep your body working well. Your doctor can also prescribe drugs that may slow the course of the disease, prevent or treat attacks, ease your symptoms, or help you manage the stress that can come with the condition. Drugs that may slow your MS or help nerve damage include: Beta interferon ( Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) Copolymer-1 ( Copaxone) Dalfampridine ( Ampyra) Dimethyl fumarate ( Tecfidera) Mitoxantrone ( Novantrone) Natalizumab ( Tysabri) Ocrelizumab ( Ocrevus) Teriflunomide ( Aubagio) Your doctor may give you steroids to make your MS attacks shorter and less severe. You can also try other drugs, like muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, or botulinum toxin ( Botox), to ease muscle spasms and treat some of the other symptoms. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will keep up your strength and balance and help you manage fatigue and pain. An occupational therapist can teach you new ways to do certain tasks to make it easier to work and take care of yourself. If you have trouble getting around, a cane, walker, or braces can help you walk more easily. Along with treatment, you can do other things to ease your MS symptoms. Get regular exercise and avoid too much heat to boost your energy. \x1b[92m[8] Ask your doctor about trying yoga to ease fatigue or stress.\x1b[0m Take care of your emotional health, too. It's OK to ask family, friends, or a counselor for help with any stress or anxiety you may feel. Support groups are also great places to connect with other people living with MS. Research is giving doctors more treatment options for the condition, a better idea of what causes it, and the ability to diagnose it earlier. Stem-cell and genetic research may soon help doctors repair damaged nerves or stop the disease before it causes damage. Scientists are also looking for new ways to treat MS in clinical trials. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They're often a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Ask your doctor if one of these trials might be a good fit for you.""]",What lifestyle changes can I implement to treat multiple sclerosis?,"To manage multiple sclerosis (MS), adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can be beneficial [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m.

', ""https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/understanding-skin-cancer-treatment\nAll potentially cancerous skin growths must be biopsied to confirm a cancer diagnosis. Depending on the suspected type of skin cancer, the biopsy techniques vary slightly but crucially. Any potential melanoma requires a surgical biopsy, in which the entire growth is removed with a scalpel if possible. A pathologist then studies the sample under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present. Ifmelanomais diagnosed, other tests may be ordered to assess the degree of cancer spread (metastasis). They include: Imaging. Your doctor will order one or more tests to look for metastasis. They include CT scan, MRI, PET scan, bone scan, and chest X-ray. Other biopsies. Using a variety of techniques, your doctor may want to get tissue samples from lymph nodes. Skin growths that are most likely basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or other forms of non-melanoma can be biopsied in various ways. Part or all of the growth can be taken with a scalpel for examination under a microscope. Most skin cancers are detected and cured before they spread. Melanoma that has spread to other organs presents the greatest treatment challenge. Standard treatments for localized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are safe and effective and cause few side effects. Small tumors can be surgically excised, removed with skin scraping and electric current cauterization, frozen with liquid nitrogen, or killed with low-dose radiation. In rare cases where basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma has begun to spread beyond the local skin site, the primary tumors are first removed surgically. Then patients may be treated with radiation, immunotherapy in the form of interferon, and rarely, chemotherapy. However, responses to this therapy are infrequent and short-lived. Rare patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma respond well to a combination of retinoic acid (a derivative of vitamin A) and interferon (a type of disease-fighting protein produced in labs for cancer immunotherapy). Retinoic acid may inhibit cancer recurrence in patients who have had tumors removed, but there is a lack of evidence to support either of these treatments. Vismodegib ( Erivedge) may be used to treat the rare cases of locally advanced, or metastatic, basal cell carcinoma and has been shown to shrink these tumors. Sonidegib ( Odomzo) can be used to treat patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma who are not candidates for surgery or radiation. It may also be used if the skin cancer returns after surgery or radiation. Melanoma tumors must be removed surgically, preferably before they spread beyond the skin into other organs. The surgeon removes the tumor fully, along with a safe margin of surrounding tissue and possibly nearby lymph nodes. Neither radiation nor chemotherapy will cure advanced melanoma, but either treatment may slow the disease and relieve symptoms. Chemotherapy, sometimes in combination with immunotherapy -- such as interferon, interleukin-2 -- is generally preferred. If melanoma spreads to the brain, radiation is used to slow the growth and control symptoms. Proton therapy may be used, as well. Immunotherapy is a field of cancer treatment that attempts to target and kill cancer cells by manipulating the body's immune system. Some of the most promising developments in the field of immunotherapy have arisen from efforts to cure advanced melanoma. Some researchers are treating advanced cases with vaccines, while others are using drugs such as interferon, interleukin-2, and ipilimumab ( Yervoy) in an effort to stimulate immune cells into attacking melanoma cells more aggressively. In patients with advanced melanoma, two drugs, nivolumab ( Opdivo) and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) have been found to be effective after use of ipilimumab. These drugs help block proteins on T cells that normally help keep them in check, therefore allowing these immune cells to attack melanoma cells. Genetic manipulation of melanoma tumors may make them more vulnerable to attack by the immune system. Each of these treatment approaches aims to immunize a patient's body against its own cancer -- something the body cannot do naturally. There are other drugs that target specific genes within normal cells that cause them to become cancerous. Called targeted therapy, these drugs include dabrafenib ( Tafinlar), trametinib ( Mekinist) and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf). \x1b[92m[0] People who have had skin cancer once are at risk for getting it again.\x1b[0m Anyone who has been treated for skin cancer of any kind should have a checkup at least twice a year. About 20% of skin cancer patients experience recurrence or a second separate tumor, often within the first two years after diagnosis. Once skin cancer is diagnosed, the only acceptable treatment is medical care. Alternative approaches may be useful in cancer prevention and in combating nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and headaches from chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy used to treat advanced skin cancer. Be sure to discuss any alternative treatments you are considering using with your cancer doctor. Skin experts know that the mineral zinc and the antioxidant vitamins A (beta-carotene), C, and E can help repair damaged body tissue and promote healthy skin. Now, researchers are trying to determine whether these and other nutrients might protect skin from the harmful effects of sunlight. To test the theory, selected skin cancer patients are given experimental supplements of these vitamins in the hope of preventing cancer recurrence.

This article was reviewed for medical accuracy by Reena A. Garg, MD. Reena A. Garg, MD ', 'https://www.solanoeye.com/blog/detail/2011/07/25/can-people-with-glaucoma-wear-contact-lenses.html\nSoft contact lenses have become enormously popular because of their comfortable fit. In many cases, soft prescription contact lenses can also be worn for extended periods of time. Soft contact lenses have also been worn by many glaucoma patients with little to no consequence whatsoever. \x1b[92m[1] Again, it is important to note that if you think soft contact lenses may be appropriate for you, it is crucial that you see an ophthalmologist that specializes in contact lenses and/or glaucoma first.\x1b[0m The Bad News Topical eye treatments are the most common form of medication used in the early stages of glaucoma. What does this mean? Two words: eye drops. Most doctors will prescribe several types of eye drops to treat glaucoma. You will likely be applying eye drops every single day or as much as several times a day. Unfortunately, skipping one or more doses can cause further damage to the optic nerve. What does this mean to potential users of corrective contact lenses? Interactions ', ""https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/glaucoma-facts-you-need\nThere is nothing that will prevent glaucoma, but you can slow down its development with early treatment. Therefore, it is very important that you have regular eye exams. Your doctor will perform a series of painless tests -- eye pressure measurements, dilated eye exams, and sometimes visual field testing and other tests -- to check for any changes in your eye or in your vision. With early detection, glaucoma can often be controlled with medications, such as eye drops. If your glaucoma doesn't respond to medication, your doctor may also recommend surgery. Remember, because glaucoma is painless, about half of people who have it don't know they have it. You can't get your vision back once it is lost. Your best protection is to get regular eye exams, every couple of years if you are over 40 or on a schedule recommended by your doctor. The chances are good that you will not go blind if you take your medication correctly and regularly and follow up with your doctor. Treatment significantly slows the damage that occurs to the optic nerve because of the high pressure in the eye. In fact, if you take your eye drops on schedule each day, you'll probably keep your eyesight until the day you die of old age! Not necessarily, but it does increase your risk. Other factors that may increase your risk are: Being over age 50 Being over age 40 and African- American Having a family history of glaucoma Having a history of serious eye injury Taking steroid medications Having diabetes Being nearsighted Having high blood pressure People with these risk factors should have their eyes examined on a regular basis to look for the disease. Yes. There are many different types of medications (in eye drops or pills) that are used to treat glaucoma. Typically, the doctor will start you on an eye drop formula. The medications work two ways: Some decrease how much fluid is produced in the eye; others help the fluid flow out better. Many people can preserve their vision if they take their medications as scheduled and visit their doctor regularly. Note: Medications for glaucoma -- even eye drops -- can affect the entire body, so you should alert all of your doctors that you are taking them, as well as report all of your medical conditions to your eye doctor. In some people, however, drugs alone do not control the eye pressure, and surgery is needed. One type of surgery called laser trabeculoplasty uses a laser to improve the flow of fluids out of the eye. This can be done in your doctor's office. There are also several conventional surgeries -- the most common is called trabeculectomy -- in which your doctor creates a new drainage path in the eye under the eyelid. This surgery must be done in an operating room. After both of these procedures, people may still have to take eye drops to further lower the eye pressure. Studies performed in the 1970s reported that smoking marijuana could lower eye pressure. Other studies have been inconclusive. Newer reviews by the National Eye Institute and the Institute of Medicine show that there is no scientific evidence that marijuana is more effective than the drugs currently available. Most people with glaucoma can still drive -- as long as they pass the Department of Motor Vehicles' vision test. Simply put, your ability to drive will depend on how much vision has been lost. Some people with advanced glaucoma can still get their license renewed but with restrictions. Ask your doctor to discuss your condition with you to determine if driving will be a concern for you. \x1b[92m[3] Whether or not you can wear contact lenses depends on which glaucoma treatment your doctor selects for you.\x1b[0m You should be able to continue wearing them if you use eye drops. However, some drugs may need to be taken when lenses are not in your eyes. Also, some of the older medications can affect your prescription, so you may need to get new contacts at some point. If your doctor decides that you need surgery, your ability to wear contacts may be affected. Be sure to discuss your contacts with your doctor so together the two of you can manage your vision concerns and your medication concerns. Being diagnosed with glaucoma is scary. Many older people are dealing with several problems that come with age. They often worry that they will become a burden to the family if they lose their vision. So, first, reassure your parent that many people keep their vision with proper medication and care. Next, help your loved one establish a routine so eye drops are applied correctly on schedule. Some eye drops must be applied several times a day. This can be especially difficult for people with arthritis, and, frankly, not an easy task for anyone to remember! You could offer to help, perhaps by swinging by the house or by calling with a reminder. If that's not possible, talk with your parent's doctor to make sure a plan is in place. Compliance with drop regimens is extremely important in glaucoma to prevent permanent vision loss. If your parent faces surgery, do what you can to help him or her prepare, then arrange transportation to follow-up visits to the doctor. There are many services and products available to help someone with impaired vision continue to write checks, organize their kitchen, tell time, and even play cards. Contact the Glaucoma Foundation to learn about them.

Caused by the group A streptococcus bacteria, strep throat is an infection that requires prompt treatment, particularly in children over the age of 3.\x1b[92m[1] Left untreated, strep throat can lead to kidney inflammation or rheumatic fever, a serious illness that can cause stroke and permanent damage to the heart.\x1b[0m Fortunately, strep throat can be easily diagnosed with a simple throat culture, and promptly treated with a course of antibiotics.At Yale Medicine, our pediatricians are skilled at diagnosing and treating strep throat, including being able to identify the rare cases that demand a higher level of care, says Maryellen Flaherty-Hewitt, MD, a Yal"", 'https://www.cdc.gov/group-a-strep/testing/index.html#:~:text=A%20rapid%20strep%20test%20involves,are%20likely%20causing%20the%20illness.\ncare providers generally ask about symptoms and do a physical exam. They may need to test for strep throat or scarlet fever. There are two types of tests: a rapid strep test and throat culture. How testing works A healthcare provider may swab your throat to test for bacteria. If healthcare providers suspect strep throat or scarlet fever, they will test for group A strep. Generally, healthcare providers will do a rapid strep test first, then decide if a throat culture is needed. Rapid strep test \x1b[92m[2] A rapid strep test involves swabbing the throat and running a test on the swab. The test quickly shows if group A strep bacteria are likely causing the illness.\x1b[0m Throat culture A throat culture takes time to see if group A strep bacteria grow from the swab. While it takes more time, a throat culture sometimes finds infections that the rapid strep test misses. Testing results Positive test (rapid or culture) A positive result means group A strep bacteria are likely causing the sore throat or rash.', 'https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/strep-throat\ndelines Visitor Guidelines Close Search Search Johns Hopkins Medicine Search Close Health Health Close Main Menu Health Main Menu Health Conditions and Diseases Treatments, Tests and Therapies Wellness and Prevention Caregiving Home Health Conditions and Diseases Strep Throat Voice and Swallowing Disorders Head and Neck Ear Nose and Throat Pediatric ENT (Otolaryngology) Strep throat is a common and contagious bacterial infection.

The best results are achieved using a whirlpool bath that contains a mild antiseptic.The affected area should be rewarmed slowly by immersing it in warm, but not hot, water. A bath of water at a temperature of 37C to 39C (98.6F to 102.2F) is recommended.Rewarming should last at least 30 minutes and only be stopped once the affected body part is a red-purple colour and can be easily moved.This process can be repeated twice a day until there are clear signs that the affected body part is beginning to heal, such as the growth of new skin and the return of normal skin colour.Depending on the severity of pain, strong painkillers, such as morphine, may be needed. Ibuprofen should also be taken as it has additional protective properties for frostbite.After rewarmingAfter the frostbitten area has been thawed, it should be gently wrapped in clean bandages, with the fingers and toes separated.

The faster tissue is thawed, the less tissue damage occurs. According to Handford and colleagues, 'The Wilderness Medical Society and State of Alaska Cold Injury Guidelines recommend a temperature of 37–39 °C, which decreases the pain experienced by the patient whilst only slightly slowing rewarming time.' Warming takes 15 minutes to 1 hour. The faucet should be left running so the water can circulate. Rewarming can be very painful, so pain management is important.

What is AIDS? AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. This is when the immune system is at its weakest and a person has one or more specific illnesses. AIDS is now very rare in Australia. HIV treatments are highly effective – they protect the immune system by: preventing the virus from multiplying reducing the damage to the specific cells targeted by HIV. Most people living with HIV on effective treatment in Australia can expect to live long, healthy lives without ever developing AIDS. How HIV spreads HIV is a blood-borne virus – it carries through blood and some body fluids. HIV can spread from one person to another by: blood semen ', 'https://www.unaids.org/en/frequently-asked-questions-about-hiv-and-aids\nStay home if you feel unwell. \x1b[92m[4] If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.\x1b[0m Follow the directions of your local health authority. UNAIDS recognizes, however, that in many countries, owing to weaker health-care systems, informal settlements, overcrowded cities and public transportation and a lack of clean water and sanitation, the current approaches to self-protection, social distancing and containment may not be viable. 43) Does UNAIDS have any specific recommendations for people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic? UNAIDS recommends that people living with HIV should have a supply of necessary medical supplies on hand—ideally for 30 days or more. This includes both antiretroviral therapy and other regular medicines, such as tuberculosis treatment, contraceptives and other ongoing treatment for noncommunicable diseases and mental health. ', 'https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/colds-chronic-medical-conditions\nFor most folks, the misery of a cold is a short-term affair. Sure, you feel sneezy and drippy now, but you feel confident you\'ll be out of the woods in a few days, maybe a few weeks at most. If you have an ongoing medical condition, though, you need to take extra precautions. Getting sick can make your health problems worse. It\'s a ""chronic,"" or long-term, lung disease that affects about 24 million Americans. If you have it, a cold can make your symptoms worse. You might find it harder to breathe. Also, some medications, like antihistamines, can thicken mucus, making it harder to cough up when you have asthma. For in-depth information, see Asthma and Colds. If you have complications from your cold, such as lung infections, it makes it hard to take in oxygen efficiently. When that happens, your heart works even harder to pump oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. For in-depth information, see Heart Disease and Colds. \x1b[92m[2] It makes it harder for you to ward off a cold virus.\x1b[0m Also, when you get sick, it adds extra stress to your body. This can affect your blood sugar levels, so it\'s important to take steps to keep them in a good range. For in-depth information, see Diabetes and Colds. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis affect about 11 million adults in the U. S. In both conditions, which are usually caused by long-term smoking, there\'s an airflow blockage that gets in the way of breathing. The symptoms of both conditions get worse when you have a cold. For in-depth information, see Emphysema, Chronic Bronchitis, and Colds. \x1b[92m[0] HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, kills or damages cells in the immune system, your body\'s defense against germs.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] This makes it more difficult to fight infections like a cold.\x1b[0m When you get sick, you\'re also more likely to get complications such as pneumonia. For in-depth information, see HIV/ AIDS and Colds. It\'s sometimes hard to avoid catching a cold, but there are steps you can take to cut your risk: Wash your hands. Most cold viruses are spread by direct contact. Fight back by keeping your hands clean. Don\'t touch your face. Viruses enter your body through your eyes, nose, and mouth. Keep your hands away from those areas to avoid a cold. Move regularly. Aerobic exercise, which gets your heart pounding, helps increase your body\'s natural virus-killing cells and helps you fight off a cold. If you\'ve got a long-term medical condition, talk to your doctor before you start a program of physical activity. Eat healthy. Make sure your diet includes foods with lots of nutrients, like dark green, red, and yellow vegetables and fruits. But make sure your meals include lean protein, good fats, and complex carbs to keep your immune system in top shape. Don\'t smoke. Heavy smokers get more severe colds and more frequent ones. Even being around smoke zaps your body\'s ability to fight off a cold. Cut down on alcohol. Heavy drinkers are more likely to get sick and also get complications from a cold. De-stress. There\'s some evidence that when you relax, your immune system gets stronger. Take time to learn how, and use those techniques throughout your day. People with some long-term medical conditions are more likely to have side effects from cold medicines. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you buy any. And make sure the medication doesn\'t interfere with other drugs you take. Talk to your doctor before you get sick so you can make an action plan for a cold. It can lay out what to do if: Your cold symptoms get worse after 3 to 4 days. You get nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, high fever, shaking, chills, or coughing with thick, yellow-green mucus. Call 911 if you have trouble breathing or get chest pain.']",How does having a cold affect you if you have HIV/AIDS?,"Having a cold when you have HIV/AIDS can be significantly more severe due to the compromised immune system caused by HIV [92m[0][0m.

"", 'https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/your-headaches-are-getting-worse-do-you-need-an-imaging-test-2020050719733\nMany providers would consider ordering brain imaging studies, such as CT scans and MRIs, to help them diagnose worsening headache. CT scan is an x-ray-based imaging study. It is an excellent initial imaging test for detecting bleeding, skull fractures, and space-occupying lesions such as tumors. CT scans do expose patients to a low dose of radiation so their use should be limited, because the effects of radiation exposures add up over time and could reach a harmful level. In contrast, MRI uses a magnetic field to generate imaging without radiation. \x1b[92m[6] It produces more detailed images than CT scans, especially of the brain, the meninges (the membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord), nerves, and blood vessels.\x1b[0m However, MRI cannot be performed in people with pacemakers or other electronic implants.

It is understandable that people with increasingly severe headaches would want to have brain imaging to determine the underlying causes. But most headaches that are categorized as primary (based on a person’s headache history and physical and neurological evaluation) do not require brain imaging studies. Brain scans are much more effective for identifying underlying causes of secondary headaches. Several evidenced-based guidelines, including guidelines which were published in the Journal of the American College of Radiology in November 2019, can help providers decide when and which imaging studies are appropriate. ', 'https://www.healthimages.com/imaging-tests-for-headaches/\n\x1b[92m[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans do not use x-rays to create brain images.\x1b[0m Instead, an MRI scan uses radio waves and magnets to produce the results. MRIs are a lot more detailed than CT scans and provide much more information. This makes it the headache imaging type of choice for those needing a diagnosis of sub-acute or chronic symptoms. However, the detail comes at the expense of time, with MRI scans taking up to an hour or sometimes even 90 minutes to capture all the necessary images. MRIs often use a contrast agent to enhance the definition of the end images. This involves receiving an injection in the arm, which may make you feel flushed. Before the MRI exam, you can eat normally and continue taking your medications. Leave all jewelry at home and be prepared to change into a hospital gown, as these items are prohibited in the MRI scanner room: Watches Credit cards Hearing aids Pins and hairpins Metal zippers Removable dental work Pens Eyeglasses Body piercings Mobile phones ', 'https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/making-diagnosis-mri\nAn MRI is a test that makes clear images of the brain without the use of X-rays. Instead, it uses a large magnet, radio waves, and a computer to produce these pictures. The scan can give doctors information about the structure of the brain and brain chemicals to help them find the cause of your headaches. Your doctor might recommend one if you\'re getting headaches daily or almost every day. You might also get one if you had a CT scan that didn\'t show clear-cut results. \x1b[92m[14] MRI scans also can look at parts of the brain that aren\'t as easily viewed with CT scans, such as the spine at the level of the neck and the back portion of the brain.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[12] An MRI can\'t diagnose migraines, cluster, or tension headaches, but it can help doctors rule out other medical conditions that may cause your symptoms, such as: A brain tumor An infection in your brain, called an abscess The buildup of fluid in the brain, called hydrocephalus Spinal cord problems, such as a herniated disc Strokes Injuries Yes.\x1b[0m The MRI exam poses no risk to the average person. The scan is also safe for people who\'ve had heart surgery and people who have these medical devices: Surgical clips or sutures Artificial joints Staples Cardiac valve replacements (except the Starr- Edwards metallic ball/cage) Disconnected medication pumps Vena cava filters Brain shunt tubes for hydrocephalus Some things may mean you shouldn\'t have an MRI.

In most cases, it takes 40 to 80 minutes, during which technicians will get several dozen images of your brain. Leave personal items such as a watch, wallet, including any credit cards with magnetic strips (they will be erased by the magnet), and jewelry at home if possible, or take them off before the scan. Sometimes, you\'ll get a drug to make you feel relaxed and drowsy. You may also need to change into a hospital gown. Also, MRI machines can be loud, so if you\'re sensitive to noise, ask for earplugs before the scan starts. As it begins, you\'ll hear the equipment making a muffled thumping sound that will last for several minutes. Other than the sound, you shouldn\'t feel anything unusual during the scanning. For some MRI exams, you\'ll need a shot of a ""contrast material"" into your vein. \x1b[92m[4] It helps doctors see certain structures in your brain on the scan images.\x1b[0m Feel free to ask questions.
