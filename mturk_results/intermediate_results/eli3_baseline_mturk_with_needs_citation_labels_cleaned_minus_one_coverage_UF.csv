The oxygen-rich blood from the lungs then enters the left atrium and is pumped to the left ventricle. The left ventricle generates the high pressure needed to pump the blood to your whole body through your blood vessels. When blood leaves the heart to go to the rest of the body, it travels through a large artery called the aorta. A balloon-like bulge, called an aortic aneurysm, can sometimes occur in the aorta.

Supplying oxygen to the heart’s muscle ', 'https://guides.hostos.cuny.edu/bio140/7-30\nThe pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood into the lungs from the heart, where it branches and eventually becomes the capillary network composed of pulmonary capillaries. These pulmonary capillaries create the respiratory membrane with the alveoli (Figure 2). As the blood is pumped through this capillary network, gas exchange occurs. Although a small amount of the oxygen is able to dissolve directly into plasma from the alveoli, most of the oxygen is picked up by erythrocytes (red blood cells) and binds to a protein called hemoglobin, a process described later in this chapter. \x1b[92m[3] Oxygenated hemoglobin is red, causing the overall appearance of bright red oxygenated blood, which returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins.\x1b[0m Carbon dioxide is released in the opposite direction of oxygen, from the blood to the alveoli. Some of the carbon dioxide is returned on hemoglobin, but can also be dissolved in plasma or is present as a converted form, also explained in greater detail later in this chapter.

Veins Veins carry blood toward the heart. After blood passes through the capillaries, it enters the smallest veins, called venules. From the venules, it flows into progressively larger and larger veins until it reaches the heart. \x1b[92m[0] In the pulmonary circuit, the pulmonary veins transport blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart.\x1b[0m This blood has a high oxygen content because it has just been oxygenated in the lungs. Systemic veins transport blood from the body tissue to the right atrium of the heart. This blood has a reduced oxygen content because the oxygen has been used for metabolic activities in the tissue cells.

The deoxygenated blood shoots down from the right atrium to the right ventricle. The heart then pumps it out of the right ventricle and into the pulmonary arteries to begin pulmonary circulation. The blood moves to the lungs, exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen, and returns to the left atrium.

(c) Reptiles also have two circulatory routes; however, blood is only oxygenated through the lungs (skin is not involved in oxygenation). The heart is three chambered, but the ventricles are partially separated. Some reptiles have an additional circuit that allows the blood to bypass the pulmonary (lung) circuit when the animal is underwater and no gas exchange can occur (shown in purple above). (d) Mammals and birds have a double circuit with 4-chambered hearts that completely separate the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood; mammalian and avian hearts pump only oxygenated blood through the body and deoxygenated blood to the lungs.

While the scene, during which McCoy delivers a eulogy for Stone, seemed innocent at first, the episode connected Barba and Stone to position the long-time New York ADA's resignation.When McCoy and Peter talk the following day, he offers the ADA a spot in New York, but he says he's only in town long enough to get his father's affairs in order. They chat about how much Ben loved Peter, then the son goes into an empty courtroom and cries.The plot then shifts to a woman trying to find her son after he was kidnapped by her husband. The situation is resolved rather quickly — with the help of Olivia Benson's (Mariska Hargitay) hostage negotiation skills — but a twist keeps the storyline jolting forward.The child is virtually braindead, with no vision, hearing or the ability to breath on his own. His life is completely dependent on machines and his mother has been trying to obtain a court order to have him euthanized. The father, who could not follow through with the potential killing of the son, took the child to keep him alive.Barba is faced with the dilemma of charging the father with kidnapping, but as he talks to the mother and sees the child for himself, he agrees the child should be put to death. Barba, who is also haunted by guilty for selfishly keeping his father on life support rather than end his suffering, turns off the child's life support machines, killing the 10-month-old boy.He is then tried for murder by attorney Peter Stone, but is found not guilty after lengthy proceedings. After the trail, Barba chooses to resign and move on from his position against McCoy's wishes.Following the episode, Esparza confirmed that he would be exiting the show after six seasons.

Then Michael Moriarty completely self-destructed, and any issues that were caused all came to a head in an ugly slugfest between Moriarty, Dick Wolf and the producers, the suits at NBC, and the fucking United States federal government. Whether the story has a happy ending depends entirely on you, and your point of view. I’ll say this, it’s a happier ending than I thought it was. Which is a good thing, because back when I was that dope sick and emotionally disturbed person lying on that couch, the guy who I could kind of identify with was Ben. Like him, I’m a slightly soft spoken and somewhat socially awkward, but at the same time intelligent, deceptively tough, and highly empathetic, White guy of chiefly Irish-English descent with a receding hairline and something of a Charlie Brown face, though Stone is taller than me (at 6'3-6'4, Moriarty was considered one of the tallest actors in Hollywood in the ‘70s and ‘80s) and much more assertive than I am. His actor struggled with a psychological disorder and substance abuse problems for most of his adult life. Being in such a raw emotional state as I was during those times viewing the show on that couch, and relating to the character and the depression that hangs over his onscreen and off-screen exit as much as I did, it’s probably no surprise that of all the characters I’ve written about already and of all the ones I will do write-ups on in the future, my favorite is Ben Stone.

The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were the most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of US$50 billion. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released at the time of the games, the cost would not boost Russia's national economy, but could attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia as a result of improved services. But by December 2014, eight months after the games The Guardian stated that Sochi 'now feels like a ghost town', citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums and arenas and the still-unfinished infrastructure. \x1b[92m[2] At least four cities withdrew their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing the high costs or lack of local support, resulting in only a two-city race between Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China who hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics.\x1b[0m The Guardian stated that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is few cities or countries want to host them. Bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics became a two-city race between Paris and Los Angeles, so the IOC took the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles. Both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games\n\x1b[92m[6] The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games.\x1b[0m Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11 days) was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games. Although, it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years in the same year as their summer counterpart. This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.:\u200ap. 405 ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games\nThe evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in numerous changes to the Olympic Games. \x1b[92m[7] Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental Games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games.\x1b[0m The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC need to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World Wars I and II led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 restrictions.

About 21% of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen. This hasn't always been the case, though. Early in our planet's history, the atmosphere had almost no oxygen. Microbes that produce their food via photosynthesis generate oxygen as a by-product. Oxygen from photosynthetic microbes eventually built up in the atmosphere, drastically changing our planet's environment and the history of life in the process. Oxygen plays a critical role in respiration, the energy-producing chemistry that drives the metabolisms of most living things. \x1b[92m[0] We humans, along with many other creatures, need oxygen in the air we breathe to stay alive.\x1b[0m Oxygen is generated during photosynthesis by plants and many types of microbes. Plants both use oxygen (during respiration) and produce it (via photosynthesis).

Scientists around the world have found that the concentration of oxygen in our water and air is actually declining, says Prof. Andrew Babbin, an oceanographer and professor of chemical oceanography and marine microbiology at MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). Why? The biggest culprit is the burning of fossil fuels. \x1b[92m[1] First, let’s talk about the oxygen that’s in our air, which we and other animals breathe every day.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2701-oxygen\nOxygen means life Oxygen is vital for life. Most living things use oxygen for cellular respiration – the process by which cells obtain energy. \x1b[92m[3] Humans and other land animals breathe oxygen (as part of air) into lungs.\x1b[0m Here it is absorbed into the blood and carried to the body’s cells. Fish use gills to obtain dissolved oxygen from the water. Insects get their oxygen through small external openings called spiracles, which lead into a network of tubes called trachea. Plants also use oxygen for cellular respiration. In a separate process – photosynthesis – plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen. In low light, the photosynthesis rate is less than the respiration rate. In bright light, the photosynthesis rate is greater than the respiration rate and more oxygen is produced than used. The excess oxygen is released into the atmosphere. Nature of science ', ""https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evo-news/the-bacteria-that-changed-the-world/\nWhere's the evolution?Figuring out the 'whodunnit' in the oxygenation of Earth’s atmosphere 2.4 billion years ago was relatively easy. Scientists know of only one process that could produce such large amounts of oxygen: photosynthesis. At the time that the planet was oxygenated, Earth was populated exclusively by single-celled organisms (Archaea and Bacteria), and only one of these can perform the sort of photosynthesis that splits a water molecule and results in oxygen gas: Cyanobacteria, whose blue-green color comes from chlorophyll. \x1b[92m[5] Today, Cyanobacteria can be found almost everywhere on Earth — likely right outside your door in the soil — and still play an important role in producing the oxygen that we breathe.\x1b[0m "", 'https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2701-oxygen\nOccurrence Oxygen is everywhere!

Oxygen forms compounds with silicon and other atoms to form minerals like quartz and sand. It is the second most abundant gas in the atmosphere. About 21% of air is oxygen. However, oxygen is very reactive. It easily combines with other elements. It is replenished by plants and other photosynthetic organisms. Oxygen also makes up most of Earth’s oceans by mass. \x1b[92m[7] A water molecule (H2O) is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\x1b[0m Although there are more hydrogen atoms in water, hydrogen has less mass.

When the earth was formed around 4.5 billion years ago, it had vastly different conditions. At that time, the earth had a reducing atmosphere, consisting of carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor, as opposed to the present-day atmosphere that consists primarily of nitrogen and oxygen. Though sunlight split the water vapor in the atmosphere into oxygen and hydrogen, the oxygen quickly reacted with methane and got locked into the earth’s crust, barely leaving any traces in the atmosphere. A silent, mysterious force worked to release oxygen steadily, until the very composition of the atmosphere changed. That mysterious entity happened to be a microbe: Cyanobacteria.

But as with everything, balance is key: too little nitrogen and plants cannot thrive, leading to low crop yields; but too much nitrogen can be toxic to plants, and can also harm our environment. Plants that do not have enough nitrogen become yellowish and do not grow well and can have smaller flowers and fruits. Farmers can add nitrogen fertilizer to produce better crops, but too much can hurt plants and animals, and pollute our aquatic systems.

28,584,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Community\nSouth Sudan's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, claimed publicly in October 2015 that, following evaluations and meetings of a special technical committee in May, June, August, September and October, the committee has recommended that South Sudan be allowed to join the East African Community. Those recommendations, however, had not been released to the public. It was reported that South Sudan could be admitted as early as November 2015 when the heads of East African States had their summit meeting. \x1b[92m[1] South Sudan was eventually approved for membership to the bloc in March 2016, and signed a treaty of accession in April 2016.\x1b[0m It had six months to ratify the agreement, which it did on 5 September, at which point it formally acceded to the community. It does not yet participate to the same extent as the other members.[timeframe?] Democratic Republic of the Congo's accession "", 'https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/SSD\nRelations with the international community and neighboring countries have been strained during the civil war. All neighboring countries have economic, political and strategic stakes in South Sudan and are, for this reason, directly or indirectly affected by the conflict. With multiple political conflicts within and among the states of the region, as well as recent political changes, it remains to be seen whether the new government of unity will be able to gain momentum and cooperate with its neighbors on the challenges ahead.After the start of the civil war in 2013, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) initiated and oversaw a mediation process. However, the neutrality of the IGAD’s efforts was compromised by the presence of the Ugandan army on South Sudanese soil. More broadly, a disconnection existed between the objectives of the regional IGAD body (which was responsible for the peace talks, as well as a monitoring and observation mission observing the earlier cease-fires) and those of the individual member states (each with their own interests). Following the new outbreak of violence in 2016, Ethiopia took the lead in IGAD’s mediation efforts. As a result of political changes in Ethiopia, the negotiations were handed over to Sudan, which exerted significant pressure on the opposition to agree to the peace deal. Khartoum found common ground with Kiir and supported a peace deal similar to the one in 2015, which favored the Kiir side. However, this changed once again after the revolution in Sudan, although Sudan has an interest in improving relations with South Sudan. Therefore, a window of opportunity exists for enhanced relations and cooperation in the region.South Sudan is an important trading partner, particularly for Uganda, but also for Kenya. Each of the neighbors has sought to further its own interests while pushing the regional body IGAD to find a permanent solution. At the moment, the instability in the country inhibits South Sudan’s potential economic role in the region. The country became a member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in 2011, but IGAD suspended South Sudan’s membership due to the country’s failure to pay its membership fee. \x1b[92m[0] In 2016, South Sudan joined the East African Community (EAC), but it did not send delegates to EAC meetings for several years.\x1b[0m The first delegates to the EAC were elected in September 2022. Within the EAC, there are discussions about ways to revitalize the landlocked state through new highways and oil pipelines, but these plans have been delayed for years due to the civil war. South Sudanese delegates often missed EAC meetings and did not pay fees to this organization either. However, since the conclusion of the peace deal and further driven by the necessity to cooperate on cross-border issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, South Sudan has appeared to be more willing to cooperate regionally than before.

Despite Lennon initially not convinced about George, he was allowed to join the band at just 14 years old. \x1b[92m[6] After a self-made recording of Buddy Holly covers, they moved from skiffle towards Rock and Roll causing all but John, Paul and George to leave and in 1960 they changed the name of the band for the final time to The Beatles.\x1b[0m From 1962 to 1965, Harold Hargreaves Harrison and his family which included George Harrison lived at 174 Macketts Lane, Liverpool while another George called George Rawlinson lived just nine doors away at 156 Macketts Lane with his mother, Esther and his father, also called George. \x1b[92m[5] During this period, The Beatles enjoyed huge success and developed into arguably the UK’s greatest band.\x1b[0m "", ""https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2021/03/case-for-prince\nThis was not a fluke.

This theory proposes that the story first formed during the 16th and 17th centuries when a large number of trials were being held throughout Europe in which men were accused of being werewolves who had molested or killed and eaten young children.

I say ‘wolf,' but there are various kinds of wolves. There are also those who are charming, quiet, polite, unassuming, complacent, and sweet, who pursue young women at home and in the streets. And unfortunately, it is these gentle wolves who are the most dangerous ones of all. \x1b[92m[2] Perrault's tales are lots of fun, and are very well known to American audiences.\x1b[0m But just remember when you read them, that they are not proper fairy tales, they are cautionary tales with some pretty heavy-handed didacticism.

The image appears larger than the actual object and is upright. The virtual image is formed as the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point behind the mirror. Changing Distance and Image Properties: As the distance between the object and the concave mirror increases, the size of the image decreases. Eventually, at a certain distance, the image transitions from virtual to real. In this case, a real and inverted image is formed on the opposite side of the mirror. \x1b[92m[4] Versatile Image Formation: Concave mirrors have the ability to create images that can vary in size, from small to large, and in nature, from real to virtual.\x1b[0m These characteristics make concave mirrors useful in various applications such as telescopes, shaving mirrors, and reflecting headlights. Convex Mirror Definition ', 'https://byjus.com/physics/concave-convex-mirrors/\nA concave mirror is a curved mirror where the reflecting surface is on the inner side of the curved shape. It has a surface that curves inward, resembling the shape of the inner surface of a hollow sphere. Concave mirrors are also converging mirrors because they cause light rays to converge or come together after reflection. \x1b[92m[2] Depending on the position of the object and the mirror, concave mirrors can form both real and virtual images.\x1b[0m Characteristics of Concave Mirrors Converging Mirror: A concave mirror is often referred to as a converging mirror because when light rays strike and reflect from its reflecting surface, they converge or come together at a specific point known as the focal point. This property of concave mirrors allows them to focus light to a point. ', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concave-and-convex-mirrors/\n\x1b[92m[0] The image formed by the concave mirror can be small or enlarged or can be either real or virtual.\x1b[0m Applications of Concave Mirrors Used in shaving mirrors: Converging mirrors are most widely used in shaving because they have reflective and curved surfaces. At the time of shaving, the concave mirror forms an enlarged as well as erect image of the face when the concave mirror is held closer to the face. The concave mirror used in the ophthalmoscope: These mirrors are used in optical instruments as in ophthalmoscopes for treatment. Uses of the concave mirrors in astronomical telescopes: These mirrors are also widely used in making astronomical telescopes. In an astronomical telescope, a converging mirror of a diameter of about 5 meters or more is used as the objective.

79,477,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading\nSeafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate slab pull at subduction zones, rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. Plates that are not subducting are driven by gravity sliding off the elevated mid-ocean ridges a process called ridge push. \x1b[92m[1] At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed.\x1b[0m Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone.

Every few hundred thousand years the earthŌĆÖs magnetic field reverses, in a process known as geomagnetic reversal. Some bands of rock were produced during a time when the polarity of the earthŌĆÖs magnetic field was the reverse of its current polarity. Geomagnetic reversal allows scientists to study the movement of ocean floors over time. ┬Ā ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics\nTectonic plates are relatively rigid and float across the ductile asthenosphere beneath. Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection currents, the slow creeping motion of Earth's solid mantle. \x1b[92m[3] At a seafloor spreading ridge, plates move away from the ridge, which is a topographic high, and the newly formed crust cools as it moves away, increasing its density and contributing to the motion.\x1b[0m At a subduction zone the relatively cold, dense oceanic crust sinks down into the mantle, forming the downward convecting limb of a mantle cell, which is the strongest driver of plate motion. The relative importance and interaction of other proposed factors such as active convection, upwelling inside the mantle, and tidal drag of the Moon is still the subject of debate. Key principles "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading\nSeafloor spreading, or seafloor spread, is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. History of study Earlier theories by Alfred Wegener and Alexander du Toit of continental drift postulated that continents in motion 'plowed' through the fixed and immovable seafloor. The idea that the seafloor itself moves and also carries the continents with it as it spreads from a central rift axis was proposed by Harold Hammond Hess from Princeton University and Robert Dietz of the U.S. Naval Electronics Laboratory in San Diego in the 1960s.

Later, a large-scale rebellion broke out in May and turned into what may be called a full-fledged war in the affected region. \x1b[92m[5] This war brought about the end of the British East India Company’s rule in India, and led to the direct rule by the British Government (British Raj) of much of the Indian Subcontinent for the next 90 years.\x1b[0m ', 'https://unacademy.com/content/nda/study-material/indian-history/causes-of-1857-revolt/\nThe 1857 revolt was a turning point in the history of India. \x1b[92m[0] It was a result of years of discontent among the people against British rule.\x1b[0m There were many factors that contributed to this uprising, and it is important to understand all of them if we want to gain a better understanding of this important event. \x1b[92m[2] In this article, we will explore the causes of the 1857 revolt in detail and try to get a clearer picture of what led to this momentous event.A Short Note 0n Revolt of 1857The revolt of 1857 was the first major challenge to British rule in India.\x1b[0m It broke out on May 11, 1857, at Meerut, a small town near Delhi. Soon it spread to other parts of the country and became a full-fledged rebellion against the British. The main aim of the rebels was to drive the British out of India.The revolt was crushed after a long and hard-fought battle, but it left a deep impact on the course of Indian history. \x1b[92m[1] \x1b[92m[3] \x1b[92m[4] It showed the people of India that they could unitedly challenge British rule and also inspired future generations to fight for independence.\x1b[0m\x1b[0mCauses of Revolt of 1857The 1857 revolt was caused by a number of factors, both immediate and long term.\x1b[0m The following are some of the most important causes of the revolt:The Policy of AnnexationOne of the main reasons for the outbreak of the revolt was the policy of annexation pursued by the British. This policy led to the annexation of several native states, which made the people feel that their rights were being usurped.The Doctrine of LapseThe Doctrine of Lapse was another major cause of the revolt. This doctrine allowed the British to annex any native state whose ruler died without a male heir. This led to great unrest among the people, as they felt that their rights were being snatched away.Discrimination against IndiansThe British policy of discrimination against Indians was another important factor that led to the revolt. The British favoured Europeans over Indians in all aspects of life, which led to a feeling of resentment among the people.The Economic Policies of the BritishThe economic policies of the British also contributed to the outbreak of the revolt. The tax policies and other measures adopted by the British led to economic hardship for the people, which made them resentful of British rule.The Social Policies of the BritishThe social policies of the British also played a role in causing the revolt. The policy of introducing western education and culture led to a feeling of alienation among the people.Greased CartilagesThe introduction of greased cartridges was the immediate cause of the revolt. The cartridges used in the new rifles had to be greased with tallow, which is a substance derived from animal fat. This led to great resentment among the Hindu and Muslim soldiers, as they felt that this was against their religious beliefs.The rebellion was thus caused by a combination of factors, both immediate and long term. It is important to understand all of these factors if we want to get a clear picture of this historic event.Aftermath of the RevoltThe revolt of 1857 was a turning point in the history of India. \x1b[92m[3] \x1b[92m[4] It showed the people of India that they could unitedly challenge British rule and also inspired future generations to fight for independence.\x1b[0m\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] The revolt also led to a number of changes in British policy, which made the people feel that their rights were being safeguarded.The revolt of 1857 was thus a significant event in the history of India, and it is important to understand all its causes and effects.ConclusionThe 1857 revolt was caused by a number of factors, chief among them the increasing power of the British East India Company and the resentment it bred in Indian subjects.\x1b[0m The company’s monopoly on trade, its exemption from taxation, and its ever-growing landholdings created great inequality and injustice. In addition, British policies such as the Doctrine of Lapse and the Vernacular Press Act further angered Indians. Students studying this period should be aware of all these causes to gain a complete understanding of one of India’s most significant uprisings.

The height of these bluffs decreases to the south of Dubuque, though they are still significant through Savanna, Illinois.

Here are 10 facts about the French and Indian War, a conflict that is often regarded as a spark that led to the American Revolution. Fact #1: It was part of a global warThe French and Indian War refers to the North American theater of the overarching global war known as the Seven Years' War in Europe. \x1b[92m[0] The French and Indian War was fought between Great Britain and France and their colonists, as well as Native American tribes.\x1b[0m They fought over territories and expansion throughout North America.Fact #2: George Washington essentially set off the war in North America In 1754, Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, a 22 year old commander of British forces set off with his men towards the coveted Ohio River Valley to assist in building a fort. A small French company of soldiers led by Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville departed French Fort Duquesne to scout intelligence about British movements. When young Washington became aware of the French movement, he set out with his party to meet them, and ambushed them near Great Meadows in Pennsylvania. When the two sides met, Washington ordered his troops to fire, igniting a battle that resulted in the death of Ensign de Jumonville and 9 other French soldiers. After this battle, the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington moved his men into the Great Meadows, an open field, and crudely constructed Fort Necessity as a base. A few weeks later, French forces surrounded the British at Fort Necessity, forcing George Washington to surrender and unknowingly, due to poor translation, sign a document admitting to the assassination of Ensign de Jumonville.

96,530,"['https://opengeology.org/textbook/3-minerals/\nPrecipitation is the reverse process, in which ions in solution come together to form solid minerals. Precipitation is dependent on the concentration of ions in solution and other factors such as temperature and pressure. The point at which a solvent cannot hold any more solute is called saturation. \x1b[92m[0] Precipitation can occur when the temperature of the solution falls, when the solute evaporates, or with changing chemical conditions in the solution.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] An example of precipitation in our homes is when water evaporates and leaves behind a rind of minerals on faucets, shower heads, and drinking glasses.\x1b[0m ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain\nA wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually, their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. \x1b[92m[3] What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as ice pellets and snow, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground.\x1b[0m If there is a shallow near-surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result. Hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds 3,400 m (11,000 ft) above ground level. Convection Convective precipitation Orographic precipitation ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain\nThe major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. \x1b[92m[4] If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands.\x1b[0m In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes. ', 'https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/how-weather-works/weather-fronts\nSometimes a cold front follows right behind a warm front. \x1b[92m[5] A warm air mass pushes into a colder air mass (the warm front), and then another cold air mass pushes into the warm air mass (the cold front).\x1b[0m Because cold fronts move faster, the cold front is likely to overtake the warm front. This is known as an occluded front. At an occluded front, the cold air mass from the cold front meets the cool air that was ahead of the warm front. The warm air rises as these air masses come together. Occluded fronts usually form around areas of low atmospheric pressure. There is often precipitation along an occluded front from cumulonimbus or nimbostratus clouds. Wind changes direction as the front passes and the temperature either warms or cools. After the front passes, the sky is usually clearer, and the air is drier. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain\n\x1b[92m[1] The main ways water vapor is added to the air are wind convergence into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains.\x1b[0m Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.

Most species of marsupials possess a pouch in which the very premature young reside after birth, receiving milk and continuing to develop. Marsupials differ from eutherians in that there is a less complex placental connection: The young are born at an extremely early age and latch onto the nipple within the pouch.

Their babies are born very small. \x1b[92m[0] Marsupials have a special pouch where they carry their babies.\x1b[0m After the birth the baby goes into its mother's pouch, where it can drink milk and is kept warm and safe. When the babies are young they stay in the pouch all the time, but when they are older they can leave it for short times. When they are old enough and too big for the pouch they do not go into their mother's pouch anymore.

"", 'https://blog.nature.org/2019/07/02/why-do-marsupials-have-pouches-and-other-questions/\nAll marsupials are mammals, but not all mammals are marsupials. Let me explain: There are three types of mammals, differentiated by the ways they reproduce. Humans, dogs, elephants, lions, tigers, bears, and many other mammals are placental mammals. Placentals reproduce by gestating their young inside a uterus, where the young are nourished by the placenta tissue via an umbilical cord. It’s a common reproductive method, used by the majority of living mammal species. Marsupials, however, do things a little bit differently. \x1b[92m[3] Young develop inside their mother in a uterus (or two) for a short time, but they are born early and finish developing inside a special pouch.\x1b[0m (More on that later.)

In contrast, true bears are placental mammals, meaning the embryo development and nourishment happens via a placenta, allowing for a longer developmental period within the protection of the womb. © Martin Harvey / WWF 6.

113,468,"['https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology-2e/pages/3-1-the-cell-membrane\nThe cell membrane consists of two adjacent layers of phospholipids. The lipid tails of one layer face the lipid tails of the other layer, meeting at the interface of the two layers. The phospholipid heads face outward, one layer exposed to the interior of the cell and one layer exposed to the exterior (Figure 3.3). Because the phosphate groups are polar and hydrophilic, they are attracted to water in the intracellular fluid. Intracellular fluid (ICF) is the fluid interior of the cell. The phosphate groups are also attracted to the extracellular fluid. Extracellular fluid (ECF) is the fluid environment outside the enclosure of the cell membrane. \x1b[92m[3] Interstitial fluid (IF) is the term given to extracellular fluid not contained within blood vessels.\x1b[0m Because the lipid tails are hydrophobic, they meet in the inner region of the membrane, excluding watery intracellular and extracellular fluid from this space. The cell membrane has many proteins, as well as other lipids (such as cholesterol), that are associated with the phospholipid bilayer. An important feature of the membrane is that it remains fluid; the lipids and proteins in the cell membrane are not rigidly locked in place.

Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance (osmotic balance) across membranes within the body’s fluids, which are composed of water plus electrolytes and non-electrolytes. An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water. A non-electrolyte, in contrast, does not dissociate into ions during water dissolution. Both electrolytes and non-electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance. \x1b[92m[0] The body’s fluids include blood plasma, the cytosol within cells, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body.\x1b[0m The membranes of the body (such as the pleural, serous, and cell membranes) are semi-permeable: they allow passage of certain types of solutes and water, but not others. Solutions on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by movement of solutes and/or water across the membrane. ', 'https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/pednephrology/documents/education/red-team-handbook/Appendix_Renal.doc\n\x1b[92m[2] Two-thirds of total body water is in the intracellular space and one-third is in the extracellular fluid space.\x1b[0m Of the extracellular fluid (ECF), only 25% is intravascular. Thus, only about 7-8% of total body water is intravascular. The composition of the ECF is what we measure when we obtain a set of electrolytes. The sodium content of the ECF is approximately 140 mEq/l, and the potassium is only 4-5 mEq/l. The predominant anions in the extracellular fluid are chloride and bicarbonate. The composition of the intracellular fluid (ICF) is dramatically different. Whereas there is a very small concentration of potassium in the extracellular fluid, the predominant cation of the intracellular fluid is potassium with an intracellular concentration of 140 mEq/l. The intracellular chloride concentration is very low in most cells. The bulk of the anions in the intracellular compartment is made up of charges on proteins and other impermeant molecules. II.

Osmosis. Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane down its concentration gradient. If a membrane is permeable to water, though not to a solute, water will equalize its own concentration by diffusing to the side of lower water concentration (and thus the side of higher solute concentration). In the beaker on the left, the solution on the right side of the membrane is hypertonic. \x1b[92m[1] The movement of water molecules is not itself regulated by cells, so it is important that cells are exposed to an environment in which the concentration of solutes outside of the cells (in the extracellular fluid) is equal to the concentration of solutes inside the cells (in the cytoplasm).\x1b[0m Tonicity is used to describe the variations of solute in a solution with the solute inside the cell.  Three terms—hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic—are used to compare the relative solute concentration of a cell to that of the extracellular fluid surrounding the cells.

Other parameters that affect tropical rainforests are carbon dioxide concentrations, solar radiation, and nitrogen availability. In general, climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. \x1b[92m[0] However, the abundance of rainfall changes throughout the year creating distinct moist and dry seasons.\x1b[0m Tropical forests are classified by the amount of rainfall received each year, which has allowed ecologists to define differences in these forests that look so similar in structure. According to Holdridge's classification of tropical ecosystems, true tropical rainforests have an annual rainfall greater than 2 m and annual temperature greater than 24 degrees Celsius, with a potential evapotranspiration ratio (PET) value of <0.25. However, most lowland tropical forests can be classified as tropical moist or wet forests, which differ in regards to rainfall. Tropical forest ecology- dynamics, composition, and function- are sensitive to changes in climate especially changes in rainfall.

Get to know ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest\n\x1b[92m[1] Moist seasonal tropical forests receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season.\x1b[0m These forests usually fall under tropical monsoon or tropical savanna climates. Some trees in these forests drop some or all of their leaves during the winter dry season, thus they are sometimes called 'tropical mixed forest'. They are found in parts of South America, in Central America and around the Caribbean, in coastal West Africa, parts of the Indian subcontinent, and across much of Indochina. Montane rainforests These are found in cooler-climate mountainous areas, becoming known as cloud forests at higher elevations. Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between 1500 and 2500 m while the upper limit is usually from 2400 to 3300 m.

168,470,"[""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118497/reviews\nThis sequel to Touching Evil was a disappointment. It was good seeing the actors reprising their roles. All did a fine job with what they'd been given--and all the characters seemed to have meaty personal conflicts to deal with--but the basic plot line was as poor as the initial series had been excellent. The plot felt hastily thrown together and contrived, as if the goal was simply to create crises and personal trauma. What made it frustrating for me was in order to get the characters in the conflicts, they had to behave illogically or stupidly. They couldn't follow basic police procedure, because then there would be no conflict. It was as if the whole series had been dumbed down. \x1b[92m[3] It felt like it had been transformed into a typical American tv detective series, where the main character is built up--every week he undergoes some challenge (physical or emotional), so that he can overcome it and show himself to be a heroic figure.\x1b[0m This was shame because the first series had been so exceptional. In the original, the characters followed procedure, they made intelligent choices, but still ran into conflicts. "", ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118497/reviews\n12 out of 24 found this helpful.

Unfortunately mediocre, this series substitutes convolution for complexity and melodrama for psychodrama, drags out the suspenseful moments, doddles through the not-so-suspenseful moments, and never really digs into the minds or the guts of its protags. Obvious and contrived and lacking the edge of 'Wire in the Blood', the personality of 'Cracker', the realism of 'Prime Suspect', or the complexity of 'Foyle's War', this series is more sizzle than steak. \x1b[92m[4] Entertaining but not all it tries to be, 'Touching Evil' smells a bit too much like a pretentious and simple minded Hollywood soap opera.\x1b[0m (B-) "", ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118497/reviews\n\x1b[92m[0] 'Touching Evil' is such a wonderful series, but sometimes it's difficult to watch.\x1b[0m It's dark, gritty, atmospheric, sometimes sad, and sometimes heartbreaking. Bottom line: it's fantastic.The series stars heartthrob Robson Green, a quirky, intense, sexy actor who, in his role as Dave Creegan. Creegan is a divorced man with two beautiful little girls; his wife is involved with someone else. Previous to the series, he was shot and had a near death experience, which has affected him deeply as well as leaving him with a physical scar.When the series begins, he comes to work with the Organised & Serial Crime Unit, where he's teamed with Susan Taylor (Nicola Walker), an attractive, down to earth woman who realizes early on that Creegan is no typical detective. He works to get into the mind of the killer to figure out his next move.The various episodes have dealt with child kidnapping, euthanasia, murders resulting from a web game, a serial killer who communicates with a reporter, and PTSD. At one point, Creegan realizes that he must take desperate measures to protect his ex-wife and his family.Really excellent series, with absolutely no glamor, sometimes bizarrely photographed, dealing with Britain's underside. Highly recommended for the strong performances of all the actors, the charisma of Green, and the powerful stories.

However, he did not like the word, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested roboti. \x1b[92m[2] The word robota means literally 'corvée, serf labor', and figuratively 'drudgery, hard work' in Czech and also (more general) 'work, labor' in many Slavic languages (e.g.: Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Polish, Macedonian, Ukrainian, archaic Czech, as well as robot in Hungarian).\x1b[0m Traditionally the robota (Hungarian robot) was the work period a serf (corvée) had to give for his lord, typically six months of the year. The origin of the word is the Old Church Slavonic rabota 'servitude' ('work' in contemporary Bulgarian, Macedonian and Russian), which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *orbh-. Robot is cognate with the German Arbeit 'work'. "", ""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/robot\nIn 1923 a play by the Czech author Karel Čapek introduced the word robot to English. The title of the play, R.U.R., stood for 'Rossum's Universal Robots,' a fictional company that manufactured robots. These humanlike machines were supposed to perform all the hard, dull, and dangerous work for people, but they finally became resentful and rebelled, killing all humans. \x1b[92m[0] Čapek formed the word robot from the Czech robota, meaning 'forced labor.'\x1b[0m The play was very popular and influential. As a result, the word robot came to have several meanings, including 'a human being who has become brutal and insensitive or machinelike because of overwork and mistreatment.' It is used today for machines that may not look human but do perform dangerous or dull work.

It also played a huge role in bringing the multiverse into the Zeitgeist. Some of its most successful writers went on to pen stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Loki, and She-Hulk. Similar to in Doctor Who, the core concept allows the shifting writers’ room the opportunity to experiment in a universe of infinite possibility, all led by co-creator Dan Harmon’s comedic expertise. \x1b[92m[0] It has earned a place in the cultural spotlight for being one of the funniest shows on television, but also because at its very best, the emotional depth is enough to destroy you.\x1b[0m ', ""https://www.vulture.com/article/rick-and-morty-best-episodes.html\nThe emotional beats of inherited trauma land hard, especially when Hoovy’s grandkids swear a blood oath and build an entire civilization around defending against Morty.

177,460,"[""https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/treaties.htm\nThe Senate has considered and approved for ratification all but a small number of treaties negotiated by the president and his representatives. In some cases, when Senate leadership believed a treaty lacked sufficient support for approval, the Senate simply did not vote on the treaty and it was eventually withdrawn by the president. Since pending treaties are not required to be resubmitted at the beginning of each new Congress, they may remain under consideration by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for an extended period of time. In recent decades, presidents have frequently entered the United States into international agreements without the advice and consent of the Senate. These are called 'executive agreements.' \x1b[92m[4] Though not brought before the Senate for approval, executive agreements are still binding on the parties under international law.\x1b[0m Historical Overview Historical Highlights Rejected Treaties Resources "", 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CPRT-106SPRT66922/html/CPRT-106SPRT66922.htm\nforce. \x1b[92m[2] That obligation is limited to (a) States that have signed a treaty or exchanged ad referendum instruments constituting a treaty, until such times as they make clear their intention not to become a party, and (b) States that have expressed consent to be bound, pending entry into force and provided such entry into force is not unduly delayed.\x1b[0m This rule is widely recognized in customary international law. Part 2 of Section II sets forth the rules on reservations to treaties (Articles 19-23). The articles reflect flexible current treaty practice with regard to multilateral treaties as generally followed since World War II. \x1b[92m[5] The earlier traditional rule on reservations had been that in order for a State to become party to a multilateral treaty with a reservation the unanimous consent of the other parties was required.\x1b[0m That rule has given way in practice to a more flexible approach, particularly after the International Court of Justice in 1951 ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._ratification_of_the_Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child\nUnder the United States Constitution, the ratification of treaties involves several steps. \x1b[92m[0] First, the president or their representative would negotiate, agree, and sign a treaty, which would then be submitted to the United States Senate for its 'advice and consent'.\x1b[0m At that time, the president would explain and interpret all provisions in the treaty.

Employees were given the right to organize and bargain collectively and could not be required, as a condition of employment, to join or refrain from joining a labor organization. The National Recovery Administration (NRA), created by a separate executive order, was put into operation soon after the final approval of the act. \x1b[92m[0] President Roosevelt appointed Hugh S.

Johnson saw the NRA as a national crusade designed to restore employment and regenerate industry. Johnson called on every business establishment in the nation to accept a stopgap 'blanket code': a minimum wage of between 20 and 45 cents per hour, a maximum workweek of 35 to 45 hours, and the abolition of child labor.

COLE'S BIG IDEA In May, 1843, Henry Cole realised that the postal service could offer a commercial opportunity to enable people to send Christmas messages cheaply and with less hassle than having to hand write dozens, if not hundreds, of letters, each one bearing a personalised Christmas message to family, friends and acquaintances. Why not just mass produce one message that could be sent out en masse? He thought. \x1b[92m[1] And thus, he approached the artist John Callcott Horsley (1817 - 1903), and commissioned him to design a card that would contain the usual season's greetings\x1b[0m and which could then be posted out to eager recipients. Horsley went to work, and, by December, 1843, he had come up with the prototype for the first commercial Christmas card. The first cards were printed in lithography by Jobbins of Warwick Court, Holborn, London, and were hand-colored by a professional colourer by the name of Mason.

Horsley's design depicts three generations of the Cole family raising a toast in a central, hand-coloured panel surrounded by a decorative trellis and black and white scenes depicting acts of giving; the twofold message was of celebration and charity. \x1b[92m[2] Cole then commissioned a printer to transfer the design onto cards, printing a thousand copies that could be personalised with a hand-written greeting.\x1b[0m Horsley himself personalised his card to Cole by drawing a tiny self-portrait in the bottom right corner instead of his signature, along with the date 'Xmasse, 1843'.

197,444,"['https://www.thebalancemoney.com/get-rid-of-the-penny-4178219\nThe penny first entered circulation in 1793 as a pure copper coin. In 1857, the U.S. Mint added nickel to the copper to cut cost, as the cost of copper was rising. In 1864, the Mint switched to tin and zinc (bronze) instead of nickel. In 1943, pennies were made of zinc-coated steel. Copper had become essential to the war effort during World War II. The Mint accidentally made 40 copper pennies, which have become highly sought-after collectibles. The record amount paid for a 1943 copper cent was $204,000 in 2019. In 1962, pennies were no longer made with tin. \x1b[92m[3] Since 1982, the penny has been made with 97.5% zinc and just 2.5% copper.\x1b[0m At 2.500 grams, it weighs more than a dime (2.268 grams). Should Other Coins Be Eliminated, Too? ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc\nOther widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes. Alloys of 85–88% zinc, 4–10% copper, and 2–8% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings. \x1b[92m[0] Zinc has been the primary metal in American one cent coins (pennies) since 1982.\x1b[0m The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin. In 1994, 33,200 tonnes (36,600 short tons) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States.

The penny, being only one cent, is literally not worth its weight in copper. \x1b[92m[4] People could melt copper pennies and sell the copper for more than the pennies were worth.\x1b[0m After 1857, nickel was mixed with the more expensive copper. After 1864, the penny was made of bronze. Bronze is 95% copper and 5% zinc and tin. For one year, 1943, the penny had no copper in it due to the expense of the World War II. It was just zinc coated steel. After 1943 until 1982, the penny went through periods where it was brass or bronze. Today, the penny in America is 2.5% copper with 97.5% zinc. The copper coats the outside of the penny while the inner portion is zinc. For comparison's sake, the penny in Canada is 94% steel, 1.5% nickel, and 4.5% copper. "", 'https://www.thebalancemoney.com/get-rid-of-the-penny-4178219\nMany of the reasons for eliminating the penny apply to other coins as well. Inflation has destroyed the value of nickels and dimes as well as pennies. And in some cases, they cost more than they are worth (nickels) and are money losers for the Mint (nickels, again). We could easily get rid of pennies, nickels, and dimes and be no more inconvenienced than the average person in 1913. Our pockets would be lighter by not having to make the additional change. Time spent at the register would be less without having to count out dimes, nickels, and pennies. And no one would have to wonder where to cash in coins. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which pennies are worth money? All pennies are worth money, but some have become collectible. Collectors may seek out coins that were minted under unusual circumstances or with outdated designs, thus adding value to some pennies. \x1b[92m[5] When did pennies stop being made of copper?\x1b[0m ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc\n\x1b[92m[1] In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but containing primarily zinc.\x1b[0m Zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1 kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12 grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins. ', 'https://www.money.org/explore-the-world-of-money-scouts-hints-for-completing-the-boy-scout-badge-requirements/\nThe metal used to make coins starts in a solid form called an ingot. This ingot is then fed into a rolling mill that exerts pressure and the ingot bar is reduced in thickness from over six inches to a long strip of metal the thickness of the final coin. Since 1965, U.S. dimes, quarters, half dollars, and dollars have been made from a core of copper, layered between and bonded to two thinner outer layers of copper-nickel (except the current Sacagawea dollar). \x1b[92m[2] Cents since 1982 have been made of a zinc core plated with copper.\x1b[0m Once the strips, called coils, are rolled to the proper thickness, they are about 13 inches wide and over 1,500 feet in length. They are then fed through a blanking press, which punches out circular discs, called blanks. The leftover strip, now punched full of holes, is called webbing and is shredded and recycled for use in future coinage.

205,579,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastema\nA diastema (pl.\x1b[92m[2] : diastemata, from Greek διάστημα, 'space') is a space or gap between two teeth.\x1b[0m Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. More colloquially, the condition may be referred to as gap teeth or tooth gap. \x1b[92m[4] In humans, the term is most commonly applied to an open space between the upper incisors (front teeth).\x1b[0m It happens when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. In humans Causes 1. Oversized Labial Frenulum: Diastema is sometimes caused or exacerbated by the action of a labial frenulum (the tissue connecting the lip to the gum), causing high mucosal attachment and less attached keratinized tissue. This is more prone to recession or by tongue thrusting, which can push the teeth apart. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastema\n2. Periodontal Disease: Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, can result in bone loss that supports the teeth. If a person loses enough bone, the teeth can become loose and cause gaps to form. 3. Mesiodens: Mesiodens is an extra tooth that grows behind the front teeth. \x1b[92m[1] A mesiodens may push the front teeth apart to make room for itself thus creating a gap between the front teeth.\x1b[0m 4. Skeletal discrepancy: Dental skeletal discrepancy can be a cause behind gap teeth. If the upper jaw grows more than the lower jaw, teeth on the upper jaw will have more space to cover thus leaving gaps between them. 5. \x1b[92m[3] Proclination: If the front teeth are angled forward, a small gap between them may appear large.\x1b[0m This is called proclination; it may be a result of aggressive tongue thrusting. Treatment A diastema is not a pathology and doesn't require treatment. Any interventions to modify a diastema are purely cosmetic. 1. Determine the cause of the diastema, then treat the cause. "", 'https://www.briteorthodontics.com/blog/malocclusion-and-its-treatment/\nOverlapping on lower teeth to some extent is normal, but when this takes an abnormal form, it causes overbite. Your upper front teeth may bite down on your gums, or your lower front teeth may bite the roof of your mouth. Underbite An underbite which is also known as anterior crossbite occurs when your lower front teeth protrude far from your upper front teeth. Crossbite A crossbite can occur on either side of your jaw, front, or back teeth. When you suffer from a crossbite, your upper teeth bite inside your lower teeth. \x1b[92m[0] Diastema Generally known as gapping teeth, a diastema is a dental condition in which a space occurs between two adjacent teeth.\x1b[0m These teeth are most commonly the front two teeth.

Lining the back of both eyes is the neural sensory retina, a thin tissue paper-like piece of the brain made up of a number of functionally and cellularly distinct layers of highly specialized neurons. The retina is actually a part of the brain itself that extends into the eyes and connects to the rest of the brain via the optic nerves, one for each eye. \x1b[92m[2] The optic nerve is formed by the axons of the retinal ganglion cell neurons that form the last layer of the retina.\x1b[0m Axons are the long projections that connect a neuron to other down stream neurons. In the retina most neuron types do not have axons because the physical distances over which signals need to travel are short, but ganglion cells have long axons that project to the other parts of the visual system in the brain. \x1b[92m[0] All the ganglion cell axons bundled together form the optic nerve, one for each eye.\x1b[0m (In reality the optic nerves are misnamed, they are not actually nerves but central white matter tracts because they are part of the brain proper- the term 'nerve' is reserved for bundles of axons in the peripheral nervous system.) Photons enter the eye through the pupil and are focused onto the retina by the optics of the eye, the cornea and lens. Incoming photons are 'absorbed' by the first layer of specialized retinal neurons called photoreceptor neurons. These are the neurons in which phototransduction takes place, the transduction process of converting light into the language of the brain.

The central ganglion cell fibers run around the foveal slope and sweep in the direction of the optic nerve.  Peripheral ganglion cell axons continue this arcing course to the optic nerve with a dorso/ventral split along the horizontal meridian (Fig. 00).  Retinal topography is maintained in the optic nerve, through the lateral geniculate to the visual cortex. Fig. 00.  Schematic representation of the course of ganglion cell axons in the retina.

The ganglion cells originating temporal to the macula must also travel to the optic disc without crossing the median raphe. To do so they must arc around the papillomacular bundle, forming the appropriately named arcuate fibers. Ganglion cells originating in the areas of the retina nasal to the disc do not have to arc around the macula. They are therefore oriented radially, making a fairly straight path to the optic nerve. Visual field defects resulting from ganglion cell loss, such as those from glaucoma, correspond to these anatomical patterns.

Risk Factors Risk factors run the gamut from increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma), ischemia, compression (tumors), inflammation, infection, etc. See differential diagnosis below. \x1b[92m[4] General Pathology The optic nerve is a bundle of 1.2 million axons of retinal ganglion cells that carries visual information from the retina to the brain.\x1b[0m The optic nerve is myelinated by oligodendrocytes that do not regenerate after damage.

Horizontal cells – they receive impulses from photoreceptor cells and transmit it to bipolar cells. Amacrine cells – they relay information between bipolar cells or from bipolar cells to ganglion cells.

Influenza A viruses are also found in animals and occasionally cross species barriers, causing serious illness and acting as the source of pandemics. Strains of influenza A virus are named with H’s and N’s. H stands for hemagglutinin and N for neuraminidase. Both are proteins on the surface of the virus (antigens) that help it invade cells. There are 18 different H subtypes and 11 N subtypes, resulting in 198 possible combinations. Sometimes the strains trade genetic information, taking on new characteristics that our immune systems have never seen. This can lead to severe illness, and even death. \x1b[92m[0] Recent cross-species flu outbreaks include H5N1 'bird flu' and H1N1 'swine flu', transmitted from birds to humans and pigs to humans, respectively.\x1b[0m ""]",Explain to a third-grader: which animal is the carrier of the h1n1 virus,"The H1N1 virus, often called swine flu, is mainly carried by pigs [92m[0][0m.

My mother always said she liked Nancy because, although she was usually found in the kitchen, she also seemed to really pour coffee instead of other shows where it was obvious the cup held nothing.

This led to the Bangladesh Liberation War in March 1971. Yahya Khan was central to the perpetration of Bangladesh genocide, in which around 300,000–3,000,000 Bengalis were killed, and between 200,000 to 400,000 women were raped. In December 1971, Pakistan carried out pre-emptive strikes against the Bengali-allied Indian Army, culminating in the start of the Third India–Pakistan War. The wars resulted in the surrender of the Pakistani armed forces in East Pakistan, and East Pakistan seceded as Bangladesh. After the surrender, Khan resigned from the military command and transferred the presidency to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Khan remained under house surveillance prior to 1979 when he was released by Fazle Haq. Khan died the following year in Rawalpindi and was buried in Peshawar.
