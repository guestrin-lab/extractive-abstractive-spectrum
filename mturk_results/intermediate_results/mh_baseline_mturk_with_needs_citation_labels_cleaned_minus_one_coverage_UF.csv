16,156,"[""Carmen Miranda\nCarmen Miranda (born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha; February 9, 1909 ‚Äì August 5, 1955), was a Portuguese-born Brazilian samba singer, dancer, Broadway actress, and film star who was popular from the 1930s to the 1950s. Nicknamed 'The Brazilian Bombshell', Miranda is noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in her American films. As a young woman, she designed hats in a boutique before making her first recordings with composer Josu√© de Barros in 1929. Miranda's 1930 recording of 'Ta√≠ (Pra Voc√™ Gostar de Mim)', written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba. During the 1930s Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian 'chanchadas', films celebrating Brazilian music, dance, and the country's carnival culture. ' Hello, Hello Brazil!' and 'Hello, Hello, Carnival!' embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical 'Banana da Terra' (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her 'Baiana' image, inspired by African-Brazilians from the northeastern state of Bahia. In 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in 'The Streets of Paris' after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, 'Down Argentine Way' with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Lusophone accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's 'The Gang's All Here,' which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States. Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical 'Brazilian Bombshell' image she had cultivated, and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. In 1941 she was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her hand and footprints in the courtyard of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and was the first South American honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Miranda is considered the precursor of Brazil's 1960s Tropicalismo cultural movement. \x1b[92m[0] A museum was built in Rio de Janeiro in her honor, and in 1995 she was the subject of the documentary .\x1b[0m ""]",When did the performer of song Yipsee-I-O die?,"The performer of the song ""Yipsee-I-O"" passed away on August 8, 1995 [92m[0][0m.","The performer of the song ""Yipsee-I-O"" passed away on August 8, 1995.","['The performer of the song ""Yipsee-I-O"" passed away on August 8, 1995 \x1b[92m[0]\x1b[0m.']","['The performer of the song ""Yipsee-I-O"" passed away on August 8, 1995.']",{'0': {'citation_numbers': [0]}},No Failure,Post Hoc,,,,,,,,,224,JDbKqDU0kVcpzSa,3,3,[5.37658262252808],[109.857435703278],2024-09-04 19:07:43.688811+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0}]","[{""coverage"":0,""sentence_id"":0}]",[True],3,3

91,117,"[""https://travsd.wordpress.com/2022/05/01/for-may-day-a-round-up-of-robin-hoods/\nI am not a knee-jerk Kevin Costner hater like so many are. I think he is a good actor and a greater star, though he is naturally best in the right roles, which have tended to be cowboys or other All-American types. I also don‚Äôt object to an Americanizing of Robin Hood, at least not as far as accents go. It is of course manifestly a tale of Ye Olde England, but Hollywood has told many a Roman epic starring actors from Ohio, and let us not forget Tony Curtis in ANYTHING historical. So on the face of it, I didn‚Äôt mind his casting as Robin Hood as many did, at least not in terms of his performance. But there is something VERY absurd about him in the traditional Robin Hood outfit, which looked like the sort of thing he might turn up to a costume party in. If they had gotten more creative with the costume, something more along the lines of Russell Crowe‚Äôs 20 years later, it might have worked better. As it was, there was a good bit of critical ridicule at the time. The fact that Costner was then still at his height certainly cushioned the blowback, and the film was a financial success, much like his other hits of the time. It had plenty to commend it. The casting of Morgan Freeman as his Muslim war-buddy seemed like a masterstroke of inclusion at the time (even if in retrospect it seems more in line with Hollywood‚Äôs long tradition of magical, if expendable, black sidekicks). Naturally, Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham is genius. Sean Connery‚Äôs cameo as King Richard is inspired stunt casting. And there‚Äôs also Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Christian Slater, the divine Geraldine McEwan, and Jack Wild (of H.R. Pufnstuf and Oliver). I‚Äôm inclined to think of this as the first 'modern' telling of the Robin Hood tale, for what it‚Äôs worth. Still, one can see it as an early chink in Kevin Costner‚Äôs armor. \x1b[92m[2] The film was directed by Kevin Reynolds, who later helmed Waterworld (1995), which proved the true turning point southward.\x1b[0m "", 'Gordon Douglas (director)\n\x1b[92m[1] Gordon Douglas( December 15, 1907 ‚Äì September 29, 1993) was an American film director, who directed many different genres of films over the course of a five- decade career in motion pictures.\x1b[0m He was a native of New York City.

He was the youngest of the three sons of Arthur Richardson (1866-1928) and his wife, Lydia Susie (Russell) Richardson (1870-abt.1953). His brothers were Christopher Richardson (1893-1932) and Ambrose Richardson (1896-1971). "", ""Ralph Richardson\n\x1b[92m[1] Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 ‚Äì 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century.\x1b[0m He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. \x1b[92m[3] In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company.\x1b[0m There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. \x1b[92m[2] Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931.\x1b[0m He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.

This film focuses on the development of the relationship between Bella Swan (a teenage girl) and Edward Cullen (a vampire), and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a coven of evil vampires. The project was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures, during which time a screen adaptation that differed significantly from the novel was written. Summit Entertainment acquired the rights to the novel after three years of the project's stagnant development. Melissa Rosenberg wrote a new adaptation of the novel shortly before the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike and sought to be faithful to the novel's storyline. Principal photography took 44 days and was completed on May 2, 2008; the film was primarily shot in Oregon. 'Twilight' was theatrically released on November 21, 2008; it grossed over US$393 million worldwide. It was released on DVD March 21, 2009 and became the most purchased DVD of the year. The soundtrack was released on November 4, 2008. \x1b[92m[6] Following the film's success, 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse', the next two novels in the series, were produced as films the following year.\x1b[0m "", ""Robert Altman\nRobert Bernard Altman (February 20, 1925 ‚Äì November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a 'maverick' in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. \x1b[92m[8] He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema.\x1b[0m His style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a 'subversive' twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. \x1b[92m[7] Altman developed a reputation for being 'anti-Hollywood' and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style.\x1b[0m However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity. He preferred large ensemble casts for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic Pauline Kael, writing about his directing style, said that Altman could 'make film fireworks out of next to nothing.' In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman's body of work with an Academy Honorary Award. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations. His films 'MASH' (1970), 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller' (1971), and 'Nashville' (1975) have been selected for the United States National Film Registry. \x1b[92m[9] Altman is one of the few filmmakers whose films have won the Golden Bear at Berlin, the Golden Lion at Venice, and the Golden Palm at Cannes.\x1b[0m "", ""The James Dean Story\n\x1b[92m[0] The James Dean Story is a 1957 American documentary.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] Released two years after Dean's death, the Warner Bros.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[5] Pictures release chronicles his short life and career through black- and- white still photographs, interviews with the aunt and uncle who raised him, his paternal grandparents, a New York City cabdriver friend, and the owner of his favorite Los Angeles restaurant, and outtakes from' East of Eden', footage of the opening night of' Giant', and Dean's ironic public service announcement for safe driving from' Warner Bros.\x1b[0m Presents'. \x1b[92m[4] Martin Gabel's narration was written by Stewart Stern, who scripted Dean's' Rebel Without a Cause'.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] A directing credit was shared by Robert Altman and George W.

The film's storyline concerns a British Royal Navy artillery officer (Grant) who has orders to retrieve a huge siege cannon from Spain and transport it by ship to British forces. But first, the leader of the Spanish guerrillas (Sinatra) wants to transport the weapon 1,000 km across Spain to help in the recapture of the city of √Åvila from the occupying French before he releases it to the British. Most of the film deals with the hardships of transporting the big gun to √Åvila across rivers and through mountains, while also evading the occupying French forces that have been ordered to find it. A subplot concerns the struggle for the love of the Spanish woman Juana (Loren) by the two male protagonists. The screen story and screenplay by Edna Anhalt and Edward Anhalt was loosely based on the 1933 novel 'The Gun' by C. S. Forester. Earl Felton did an uncredited screenplay re-write, George Antheil composed the music score, while Saul Bass designed the opening title sequence. The film's music score was the last important work by George Antheil, once famous as the 'bad boy of music' in the 1920s. It is the only one of Antheil's many film scores to have been preserved on a commercial soundtrack recording.

His other notable films included 'High Noon' (1952, as producer), 'The Caine Mutiny' (1954, as producer), and 'Ship of Fools' (1965). Director Steven Spielberg described him as an 'incredibly talented visionary', and 'one of our great filmmakers, not just for the art and passion he put on screen, but for the impact he has made on the conscience of the world.' Kramer was recognized for his fierce independence as a producer-director, with author Victor Navasky writing that 'among the independents . . . none seemed more vocal, more liberal, more pugnacious than young Stanley Kramer.' His friend, Kevin Spacey, during his acceptance speech at the 2015 Golden Globes, honored Kramer's work, calling him 'one of the great filmmakers of all time.' Despite uneven critical reception, both then and now, Kramer's body of work has received many awards, including 16 Academy Awards and 80 nominations, and he was nominated nine times as either producer or director. In 1961, he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival. In 1998, he was awarded the first NAACP Vanguard Award in recognition of 'the strong social themes that ran through his body of work'. In 2002, the Stanley Kramer Award was created, to be awarded to recipients whose work 'dramatically illustrates provocative social issues'.

164,200,"[""Fast, Cheap & Out of Control\n\x1b[92m[0] Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a 1997 film by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris.\x1b[0m It profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, who is a lion tamer; George Mendon√ßa, who created topiaries at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, including giraffes made out of boxwood; Ray Mendez, a hairless mole-rats expert; and Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. \x1b[92m[6] scientist who has designed bug-like robots.\x1b[0m The film's musical score is by composer Caleb Sampson, and is performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. \x1b[92m[4] In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] The invention is called the Interrotron.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[5] His four subjects narrate the film in their own words.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'.\x1b[0m In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. \x1b[92m[7] The film is extensively cut with scenes from older films and television shows.\x1b[0m The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover's idol Clyde Beatty appears from portions of his film 'Darkest Africa' and a malicious robot appears in scenes from 'Zombies of the Stratosphere'. After using the first moments in the film to establish his characters one by one, with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another, in order to correlate the themes which the four subjects have in common. \x1b[92m[8] The title of the film is a play on the old engineer's adage that out of 'fast,cheap,' and 'reliable,' you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car).\x1b[0m Rodney Brooks, the robot scientist from MIT, wrote a paper in which he speculates that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space, instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring. \x1b[92m[3] The paper was fully titled 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System', and published in the 'Journal of the British Interplanetary Society' in 1989.\x1b[0m The film is available on VHS, DVD; the soundtrack by Caleb Sampson is available on CD.

177,159,"[""Ashoka\nAshoka (BrƒÅhmi: ëÄÖëÄ≤ëÅÑëÄì, 'Asoka', IAST: A≈õoka) sometimes Ashoka the Great, was an Indian emperor of the Maurya Dynasty, who ruled almost all of the Indian subcontinent from to 232 BCE. The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia. Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. \x1b[92m[0] The empire's capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain.\x1b[0m Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga (modern Odisha), which he conquered in about 260 BCE. In about 263 BCE, he converted to Buddhism after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War, which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations. He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia, and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha. Beyond the Edicts of Ashoka, biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later, such as the 2nd-century CE 'Ashokavadana'Narrative of Ashoka, a part of the 'Divyavadana'), and in the Sri Lankan text 'Mahavamsa'Great Chronicle). The emblem of the modern Republic of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka. His Sanskrit name  means 'painless, without sorrow' (the 'a' privativum and '≈õokapain, distress'). In his edicts, he is referred to as ' (Pali ' or 'the Beloved of the Gods'), and ' (Pali ' or 'He who regards everyone with affection').

Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. \x1b[92m[3] On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music.\x1b[0m Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others.

However, although the term 'film noir' was originally coined to describe Hollywood movies, it was an international phenomenon. \x1b[92m[4] Even before the beginning of the generally accepted classic period, there were films made far from Hollywood that can be seen in retrospect as films noir, for example, the French productions P√©p√© le Moko (1937), directed by Julien Duvivier, and Le Jour se l√®ve (1939), directed by Marcel Carn√©.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] In addition, Mexico experienced a vibrant film noir period from roughly 1946 to 1952, which was around the same time film noir was blossoming in the United States.\x1b[0m "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/film_noir\nDuring the classic period, there were many films produced in Europe, particularly in France, that share elements of style, theme, and sensibility with American films noir and may themselves be included in the genre's canon. In certain cases, the interrelationship with Hollywood noir is obvious: American-born director Jules Dassin moved to France in the early 1950s as a result of the Hollywood blacklist, and made one of the most famous French film noirs, Rififi (1955). Other well-known French films often classified as noir include Quai des Orf√®vres (1947) and Les Diaboliques (1955), both directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot.

'Standing on your balcony, one can look down and see the dirty drains or can look up and see the beautiful sky and stars,' he is reported to have once said this in an interview. His cinema was a reflection of this philosophy, which includes moments of beauty and darkness. Enriched with a profound understanding of human nature, life, death, and everything in between, the realism, wit, pathos, and social commitment he seamlessly wove make them achingly relevant even decades later. \x1b[92m[0] Hrishikesh Mukherjee passed away on 27 August 2006.\x1b[0m References https://www.thebetterindia.com/193126/hrishikesh-mukherjee-tribute-anand-golmaal-amitabh-bachchan-cinema-india/ https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/hrishikesh-mukherjee-death-anniversary-juhi-chaturvedi-5938057/ https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hrishikesh-Mukherjee Filmography (43) "", ""https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/remembering-hrishikesh-mukherjee-on-his-death-anniversary-4814127/\n\x1b[92m[3] Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate, in 1998, was Hrishi-da‚Äôs last film.\x1b[0m It wasn‚Äôt a box-office success. \x1b[92m[2] Comedian and director Sajid Khan, who worked in Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate, told a reporter in 2008, 'I have never been an assistant director to anyone, but I carefully observed Hrishikesh Da‚Äôs style of filmmaking.\x1b[0m His films had substance.'
