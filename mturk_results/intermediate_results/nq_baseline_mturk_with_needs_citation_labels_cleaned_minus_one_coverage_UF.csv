Swiss gun laws are primarily about the acquisition of arms, and not ownership. As such a license is not required to own a gun by itself, but a shall-issue permit is required to purchase most types of firearms. Bolt-action rifles, break-actions and hunting rifles do not require an acquisition permit, and can be acquired with just a background check. \x1b[92m[0] A reason is not required to be issued an acquisition permit for handguns or semi-automatics unless the reason is other than sport-shooting, hunting, or collecting.\x1b[0m Permits for concealed carrying in public are issued sparingly.[note 2] The acquisition of fully automatic weapons, suppressors and target lasers requires special permits issued by the cantonal firearms office.

After that, Scar made them his lieutenants when he took over Pride Rock as king, and invited the rest of the hyenas to leave the Elephant Graveyard and join together with the lions in a position of authority. Until Simba came back and reclaimed his rightful place as king, the hyenas had it pretty good. As it turns out, their relatively good fortune under Scar was all thanks to the hyena’s original queen, who initially allowed Scar to recruit three of her subjects for his power-hungry plot.

While still as vicious and threatening as they are in the movie, the hyenas become more neutral as the show progresses. Though they are at first shown to be more dim-witted in comparison to the original film, they become wiser near the end of their first appearance and in later episodes, often coming up with clever ways to get their meal, though many of them end in failure. The hyenas have their own segments titled 'The Laughing Hyenas', which involve the trio searching for food after running away from the Pride Lands. Outside of their own segments, they appeared in flashbacks in 'Doubt of Africa' and 'Once Upon a Timon' and made a non-speaking appearance in 'Space Ham'.

His most distinguishing feature is his unusually heavy eyebrows. Apart from these, he is the model for most generic hyenas. He is the greediest of the three, frequently making references to being hungry, and asking for food. He also usually speaks and acts without thinking, losing his temper with Ed twice, and complaining when the Pride Lands lacks food under Scar's rule ('It's dinnertime, and we ain't got no stinkin' entrees!'). He even quietly remarks to his friends that Mufasa was a better king than Scar. In addition, when about to commence the Wildebeest Stampede, he almost tried to kill and eat a sick Wildebeest before Scar gave them the signal, but was stopped by Shenzi, reminding him about waiting for Scar's signal.

When working with more than one event, you have to be concerned as to whether the first event affects the second event. When determining if events are independent, you are determining if the events are affecting one another. \x1b[92m[6] Independent Events Two events are said to be independent if the result of the second event is not affected by the result of the first event.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] The probability of one event does not change the probability of the other event.\x1b[0m If A and B are independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events. If A and B are independent events, "", 'https://www.cuemath.com/data/independent-events/\nIf the probability of events A and B is P(A) and P(B) respectively, then the two events are independent if any of the following are true: P(A|B)=P(A), P(B|A)=P(B) and P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B) How Do You Tell if an Event Is Independent or Dependent? \x1b[92m[0] Two events A and B are said to be independent if the fact that one event has occurred does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other.\x1b[0m Also if the occurrence of one event affects the probability of occurrence of the other event, then the two events are said to be dependent. Can an Event Be Mutually Exclusive and Independent Event? Mutually exclusive in math are a set of events that cannot happen at the same time. For example: when tossing a coin, the result can either be heads or tails but cannot be both. This of course means mutually exclusive events are not independent, and independent events cannot be mutually exclusive. Are Independent Events Disjoint? ', 'https://byjus.com/maths/independent-events/\nIndependent events are those events whose occurrence is not dependent on any other event. For example, if we flip a coin in the air and get the outcome as Head, then again if we flip the coin but this time we get the outcome as Tail. In both cases, the occurrence of both events is independent of each other. It is one of the types of events in probability. Let us learn here the complete definition of independent events along with its Venn diagram, examples and how it is different from mutually exclusive events. What are Independent Events? In Probability, the set of outcomes of an experiment is called events. There are different types of events such as independent events, dependent events, mutually exclusive events, and so on. \x1b[92m[2] If the probability of occurrence of an event A is not affected by the occurrence of another event B, then A and B are said to be independent events.\x1b[0m ', ""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conditional_probability.asp\n\x1b[92m[1] Two events are said to be independent if one event occurring does not affect the probability that the other event will occur.\x1b[0m However, if one event occurring (or not occurring) does affect the likelihood that the other event will happen, the two events are said to be dependent. An example of dependent events is a company's stock price increasing after the company reports higher-than-expected earnings. If events are independent, then the probability of event B occurring is not contingent on what happens with event A. For example, an increase in Apple's shares has nothing to do with a drop in wheat prices. Conditional probability is often written as the 'probability of A given B' and notated as P(A|B).

The play is one of a triad of tragedies known as the three Theban plays, following Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus. \x1b[92m[1] Even though the events in Antigone occur last in the order of events depicted in the plays, Sophocles wrote Antigone first.\x1b[0m The story expands on the Theban legend that predates it, and it picks up where Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes ends. The play is named after the main protagonist Antigone. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles\n\x1b[92m[4] Sophocles[a] (c. 497/496 – winter 406/405 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, known as one of three from whom at least one play has survived in full.\x1b[0m His first plays were written later than, or contemporary with, those of Aeschylus; and earlier than, or contemporary with, those of Euripides. \x1b[92m[2] Sophocles wrote over 120 plays, but only seven have survived in a complete form: Ajax, Antigone, Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra, Philoctetes, and Oedipus at Colonus.\x1b[0m For almost fifty years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens which took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. He competed in thirty competitions, won twenty-four, and was never judged lower than second place. Aeschylus won thirteen competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles; Euripides won four. ', 'https://femminaclassica.com/analyzing-antigone/\nTo begin to understand the psyche of Antigone, it is important to get a grasp from whence she came. Because mythology was ubiquitous to the ancient Greeks, the audience would have been all too familiar with Oedipus’s woeful tale and the cursed Laius family. Frequently performed in mythological sequence, Sophocles’ Theban saga—-Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone—- was written out of sequence and therefore not considered a trilogy in the manner of Aeschylus’ Oresteia. Each play of the Theban saga is a unit unto itself. \x1b[92m[3] Although the events in Antigone come last in the saga, in actuality, Sophocles wrote Antigone first (in about 442 BCE), preceding Oedipus the King by about twelve years.\x1b[0m Thus, the Creon in Antigone has an altogether different persona than the Creon in Oedipus the King.

This 'stand your ground law' has been used in numerous high-profile court cases. Many of the citizens of Alabama feel the law is fair. Still, critics often argue that it gives you far too much leeway to utilize deadly force and that it may disproportionately affect minorities. The law’s proponents say it is a necessary and soundly based legal tool for self-defense and is applied justly in most cases. The 'stand your ground' law in Alabama, in many ways, transformed the legal approach in self-defense cases. For example, if you believe you are in imminent threat of severe bodily harm or death, you should be able to use deadly or physical force in your defense. "", ""https://giffords.org/lawcenter/state-laws/stand-your-ground-in-alabama/\nSelf-defense laws in the US typically justify a person’s use of lethal force in public in situations where lethal force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or another person. Traditionally, these laws have been clear that taking human life is not necessary, and is therefore not justified, if the person could have avoided using lethal violence by retreating, or simply stepping away from a confrontation. A person does not have a duty to retreat from a conflict before using force in their home, however (known as the Castle Doctrine).1 Stand your ground laws upend centuries of legal tradition, allowing a person to use deadly force in self-defense in public, even if that force can be safely avoided by retreating or when nonlethal force would suffice. \x1b[92m[1] Alabama LawAlabama has adopted a stand your ground statute that removes the duty to retreat before using deadly force 'in any place where [a person] has the right to be.\x1b[0m'2MEDIA REQUESTSOur experts can speak to the full spectrum of gun violence prevention issues.

It provides that a person does not have a duty to retreat prior to the use of deadly force. \x1b[92m[2] Furthermore, Section 503.055 provides that a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where they have a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand their ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if the person reasonably believes that this is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to someone else or them, or to prevent the commission of a felony involving the use of force.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/stand-your-ground-laws-50-state-survey/\nMinnesota generally imposes a duty to retreat.

Two years later, in 1824, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (which became the Royal SPCA in 1840) was established. The society focused especially on enforcement of the law, with prosecutions where appropriate. In 1835, the Act was amended to protect domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, against cruelty. \x1b[92m[0] The first American animal protection organization, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was established in 1866.\x1b[0m By 1900, several hundred other animal protection organizations had formed in America. In 1860, the Battersea Dogs’ Home was established by Mr. Mary Tealby, the first woman to found a British animal welfare organization.

At the time, it mainly became known for Bob’s hit, Knocking In Heaven’s Door.Amazingly, another tune (Wagon Wheel) was half recorded during this time but scrapped by Bob who can be heard mumbling the chorus on a bootleg recording. Later finished by Ketch Secor (2004) who wrote the verses, it became a huge hit in the hands of Nathan Carter (2012) and Darius Rucker (2013).

A lot of these ideas did not come through in the original release cut, the studio used some six editors to hack Peckinpah’s movie to pieces. But, Thankfully, Peckinpah had his original director’s cut in his possession, which he kept hidden from the studio. That became the basis for the 115 minutes director’s cut that was released on home video almost 3 decades later, and it resurrected much of the film’s greatness. \x1b[92m[7] Anyway, despite the film being a box office flop on its release, Bob Dylan’s soundtrack was a superhit, with ‘Knockin’ on heaven’s Door‘ becoming a worldwide success.\x1b[0m Share this:TwitterFacebookPrintLinkedInRedditTumblrPinterestWhatsAppEmailLike Loading...

Britain had never given such a pledge to an eastern European country. There had never been a special relationship with Poland. Even Winston Churchill was amazed.'His Majesty's Government have given a guarantee to Poland. I was astounded when I heard them give this guarantee,' he told MPs in May 1939, when still a backbencher.So why did Britain do it? The answer of course, had less to do with Poland, and much more to do with Nazi Germany. In March 1939, Poland's southern neighbour Czechoslovakia fell apart. Adolf Hitler's German forces moved in, and Britain's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain decided that Germany could not be allowed to threaten another country. Few people remember that Britain didn't just offer support to Poland. It also pledged to help Greece and Romania, should either of those countries be attacked. Chamberlain called the assurances 'first aid treatment' - an admission that the pledges were made in a hurry, with no thought to how such promises might be honoured. Britain hoped that would be enough - it was not. Germany attacked and defeated Poland in a few weeks.

By 1967, the songwriters were a respected duo in the music industry and were invited by producer Jerry Wexler to work in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, which was a recording hotspot in the 1960s and 70s.

Tarantino stated he probably wouldn’t have used the scene if he wasn’t allowed to use the song. Pulp Fiction’s soundtrack eventually sold over 2 million copies and a re-release of 'Son of a Preacher Man' reached number 1 in Iceland.In an interview with The Robesonian, Ronnie Wilkins thanked Quentin Tarantino for using the song. 'I’m not sure he knew how much money that made for me,' he funnily remarked. 'I remember he called me up to ask about using it and then I more or less forgot about it. Later, I heard Siskel and Roper say the movie had a great soundtrack, and then I was blown away seeing how Quentin took it to a whole other level.'Dusty Springfield by Anefo – CC0The Legacy of Son of a Preacher ManOver the years, 'Son of a Preacher Man' became Dusty Springfield’s signature song and one of the most well-known songs of the 1960s. Aretha Franklin eventually regretted not recording the song and released a version of the song on her 1970 album This Girl’s in Love with You.In 1996, Dusty Springfield revealed she initially didn’t like her version of the song and preferred Aretha Franklin’s version. 'I hated it because I couldn’t be Aretha Franklin. I was someone who had come from thundering drums and Phil Spector, and I didn’t understand sparseness. I wanted to fill every space. When I got free of that I finally liked it, but it took me a long time… To this day I listen to Aretha Franklin’s phrasing and go, ‘Goddamit!’ That’s the way I should have done it.'

The island is covered with more than 100 volcanoes. Some are extinct, but over 30 are still active. The majority of volcanism in Iceland occurs along volcanic rift zones that cut through the centre of the island. At constructive plate boundaries, also known as divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move away from one another to produce volcanoes. Hot magma rises from the mantle at mid-ocean ridges, pushing the plates apart. BGS © UKRI.

Iceland, however, is also associated with a mantle plume (a narrow stem of upwelling of magma from deep in the mantle) that has maintained volcanism high and vigorous [1]. Spreading creates some sort of symmetry in the buildup of the island (although slightly distorted by the mantle plume) with the youngest rocks situated on the ridge and the older rocks away from the ridge on both sides (Figure 1).

The peninsula consists of eight volcanically active sites, so understanding whether there is one shared magma source or multiple independent ones and their depth can help predict the duration and impact of these eruptions.Using geochemical and seismic data, the researchers investigated whether the magma of the initial eruptions from one volcano in the peninsula from 2021 to 2023 came from the same source as the magma in the recent eruptions of a different volcano to the west. Bindeman specializes in isotopic analysis, which can help identify the 'fingerprint' of magma. (See Focus on Equipment and Methodology below.)

Because its history has always been closely related to volcanism, many volcanic eruptions since the middle ages have been recorded and preserved. Iceland was settled in 834 AD, established its own parliament in 930 AD and recorded its first historical volcanic eruption ~934 AD, during which Eldagia, the longest volcanic fissure in the world, was created. Due to the amount of volcanic activity – averaging one every three years – and the resulting devastation to the country of Iceland from lava, ash and sometimes years of famine, there is a well documented record of Icelandic volcanic eruptions.

This is done to take advantage of the wider angle that can be reflected by a Convex mirror. A convex mirror, also known as diverging mirror, is one which bulges at the middle and is thinner at the edges. While this captures a wider object field, it does so at the cost of image accuracy. The result is compression of the reflected image, which makes objects appear smaller and farther away than they really are. The warning is mentioned in the mirrors so that the driver can accordingly make adjustments and take a well calculated decision.

The carbohydrate molecules are obtained from the carbon dioxide from the use of chemical energy gathered during the reactions. The Light energy tends to split into the water and later extracts the electrons from the photosystem II; then the electrons move from the PSII to b6f (cytochrome) to the photosystem I (PSI) and reduce in the form of energy. ', 'https://www.albert.io/blog/photosynthesis-and-cellular-respiration-ap-biology-crash-course/\nThe process of photosynthesis is an essential AP® Biology concept to understand.  Photosynthesis is the means by which most of the plant life on Earth gets its energy.  All animals receive nutrients either from plants or from animals that get their energy from plants.  This means that plants are the basis for all of the ecosystems on Earth, making photosynthesis a very important process.  So, in order to understand how photosynthesis happens, biologists have to break it down into two parts, the light and dark reactions. 1. \x1b[92m[5] Light Reaction (or the Light-Dependent Reactions) This is the first step in the process of photosynthesis.\x1b[0m  \x1b[92m[6] The light reaction is the process by which the leaf of a plant will absorb energy from the sun (in the form of photons) and will transfer it into electron carriers and energy (in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP).\x1b[0m ', ""https://byjus.com/biology/light-dependent-reactions/\n\x1b[92m[1] 'Light reaction is the process of photosynthesis that converts energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP.'\x1b[0m What is Light Reaction? The light reaction is also known as photolysis reaction and takes place in the presence of light. It usually takes place in the grana of chloroplasts. The photosystems have pigment molecules. \x1b[92m[7] In the plants, chlorophyll is one of the primary pigments which actively takes part in the process of light reactions like photosynthesis.\x1b[0m The accessory pigments include carotenoids. The energy from the sun is absorbed by the chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts. The energy is then transferred to ATP and NADPH that is generated by two-electron transport chains. Water is used and oxygen is released during the process. Let us have an overview of light reaction and the mechanism involved in light reaction. Also Read: Cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation Process of Light Reaction "", ""https://omexcanada.com/blog/manganese-in-water-splitting-photosynthesis/\nFigure 2. \x1b[92m[9] Light energy is absorbed by a chlorophyll molecule and is passed along a pathway to other chlorophyll molecules.\x1b[0m The energy culminates in a molecule of chlorophyll found in the reaction center. The energy 'excites' one of its electrons enough to leave the molecule and be transferred to a nearby primary electron acceptor. A molecule of water splits to release an electron, which is needed to replace the one donated. Oxygen and hydrogen ions are also formed from the splitting of water. Source: https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-2-the-light-dependent-reactions-of-photosynthesis/ For more information, watch the narrated Youtube video: "", ""https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-1-overview-of-photosynthesis/\nPhotosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. \x1b[92m[2] In the light-dependent reactions, which take place at the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy with the use of water.\x1b[0m The light-dependent reactions release oxygen from the hydrolysis of water as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules. The two reactions use carrier molecules to transport the energy from one to the other. The carriers that move energy from the light-dependent reactions to the Calvin cycle reactions can be thought of as 'full' because they bring energy. After the energy is released, the 'empty' energy carriers return to the light-dependent reactions to obtain more energy. Section Summary "", ""https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-wmopen-biology1/chapter/photosynthesis/\n\x1b[92m[8] Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light.\x1b[0m Organic pigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. Energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state. Energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. So retinal pigments can only 'see' (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. For the same reasons, plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation. "", 'https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-wmopen-biology1/chapter/photosynthesis/\n\x1b[92m[4] The pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight.\x1b[0m A photon strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. The energy travels to the reaction center that contains chlorophyll a to the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior. This action builds up a high concentration of ions. The ions flow through ATP synthase via chemiosmosis to form molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy and reducing power carrier for the light-independent reactions.

It is used to alert other players or spectators when an errant golf shot is heading in their direction, posing a potential danger. The history of the term 'fore' in golf is somewhat speculative, but several theories attempt to explain its origin. 3 Possible Explanations for the History of the term 'Fore': Scottish Origins: Many believe that the term 'fore' has Scottish origins, as golf itself originated in Scotland. \x1b[92m[1] In Scottish dialects, the word 'fore' was used to mean 'before' or 'ahead.' When golfers wanted to alert others about an incoming golf ball, they would shout\x1b[0m 'fore' to let them know to watch out. Military Influence: Some theories suggest that the term 'fore' may have been borrowed from military usage. In military drills, commands like 'fire' and 'fall' were used to signal actions.

Why do golfers shout fore? The RulesThe more modern-day Rules of Golf cover the need to shout ‘fore' as early as Section 1.2a: Conduct Expected of All Players. This states that players are expected to play in the spirit of the game by 'showing consideration to others.'For example, by playing at a prompt pace, looking out for the safety of others, and not distracting the play of another player. \x1b[92m[2] If a player plays a ball in a direction where there might be a danger of hitting someone, they should immediately shout a warning, such as the traditional\x1b[0m warning of 'fore'.However, it also states that 'there is no penalty under the Rules for failing to act in this way, except that the Committee may disqualify a player for acting contrary to the spirit of the game if it finds that the player has committed serious misconduct.'And herein lies a problem, you could say.

It was proven to be too much for Fanfiction.net, a site for fans to write stories based on the art they love, and James took her stories down. Luckily for fans, though, she had the opportunity to rewrite these stories and change some details. Then, of course, she published her work as Fifty Shades of Grey and became somewhat of a household name.

After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote Master of the Universe as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, and removed it from her website before publication. Meyer commented on the series, saying 'that's really not my genre, not my thing... Good on her – she's doing well. That's great!'

In its initial iteration, E.L. \x1b[92m[6] James’ 50 Shades of Gray was known as Master of the Universe, written by James using the online handle Snowqueen’s Icedragon, as a fan fiction version of Stephenie Meyers’ Twilight saga – with the lead male figure transformed from a 114 year old vampire into an all-too human billionaire.\x1b[0m (Fan fiction, for those not familiar with it, are stories written by fans of the original story, using various story lines, characters and settings, often with large amounts of sex thrown into the mix.) As Downes writes, 'Many write unique pieces only sharing the most basic elements, while others lift whole sections of the source material in order to create their own works. This is called, in copyright, ‘derivative works,’ and renders these pieces as the property of the original creative force.' This also means, according to Downes, that it is Meyers who has the power to give her approval (or not) for these works.

172,344,"['https://byjus.com/chemistry/precipitation-reaction/\nMany chemical reactions occur in our daily lives. Common examples of such reactions are burning, corrosion, cooking of food and digestion. One important class of chemical reactions are precipitation reactions. In such reactions, two different soluble salts (which are in aqueous solutions) combine to form two products. \x1b[92m[7] One of these products is insoluble in the solution and is precipitated out (and is, therefore, referred to as the ‘precipitate’).\x1b[0m Precipitation Reaction – Definition and Meaning ', 'https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Main_Group_Reactions/Reactions_in_Aqueous_Solutions/Precipitation_Reactions\n\x1b[92m[4] Precipitates are insoluble ionic solid products of a reaction, formed when certain cations and anions combine in an aqueous solution.\x1b[0m The determining factors of the formation of a precipitate can vary. Some reactions depend on temperature, such as solutions used for buffers, whereas others are dependent only on solution concentration. The solids produced in precipitate reactions are crystalline solids, and can be suspended throughout the liquid or fall to the bottom of the solution. The remaining fluid is called supernatant liquid. The two components of the mixture (precipitate and supernate) can be separated by various methods, such as filtration, centrifuging, or decanting. Figure 1: Above is a diagram of the formation of a precipitate in solution. Precipitation and Double Replacement Reactions ', 'https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/igcse/chemistry/how-do-precipitate-formations-indicate-chemical-changes\n\x1b[92m[3] ArticleHow do precipitate formations indicate chemical changes?Precipitate formations indicate chemical changes by showing that a new substance has been created in a reaction.In chemistry, a precipitate is a solid that forms in a solution during a chemical reaction.\x1b[0m This process is known as precipitation. When two solutions are mixed together, if a chemical reaction occurs, it often results in the formation of a new substance. This new substance can be a gas, a different solution, or a solid. \x1b[92m[10] When a solid is formed, it is called a precipitate.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[8] The formation of a precipitate is a clear sign that a chemical change has taken place.The formation of a precipitate is a result of a specific type of chemical reaction called a precipitation reaction.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] In a precipitation reaction, two soluble reactants combine to form an insoluble product, the precipitate.\x1b[0m This precipitate will often settle at the bottom of the reaction vessel or float to the top, depending on its density relative to the solution. For example, if you mix solutions of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl), a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) forms. The equation for this reaction is AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO3. The silver chloride is the precipitate, and its formation indicates that a chemical change has occurred.Precipitation reactions are important in many areas of chemistry, including analytical chemistry, where they are used to identify the presence of certain ions in a solution. By observing the formation of a precipitate, chemists can infer that a chemical reaction has taken place, and use this information to identify the substances involved in the reaction.In conclusion, the formation of a precipitate is a clear visual indicator of a chemical change. It shows that a new substance has been created as a result of a chemical reaction, providing evidence of a chemical change.Answered by Till - University of Cambridge: Master’s in Chemical Engineering ', 'https://www.vaia.com/en-us/textbooks/chemistry/chemistry-matter-and-change-2007-edition/chapter-9/problem-78-under-what-conditions-does-a-precipitate-form-in-/\n\x1b[92m[0] A precipitate forms in a chemical reaction when an insoluble solid is produced due to the interaction between two or more soluble reactants.\x1b[0m This occurs when a double displacement reaction takes place and at least one insoluble product is formed according to the solubility rules. Factors like temperature, concentration, and pressure can also affect precipitation. Step by step solution 01 Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction Write down a balanced chemical equation involving the reactants provided in the problem. 02 Determine the solubility of the reactants and products Consult a solubility chart to determine which of the reactants and products are soluble or insoluble in water. 03 Identify if a double displacement reaction occurs Analyze the chemical equation to see if a double displacement reaction takes place, in which the ions from two different compounds exchange places, potentially forming a precipitate. 04 Apply the solubility rules ', 'https://www.toppr.com/guides/chemistry/solutions/precipitation-reaction-definition-and-examples/\n\x1b[92m[5] A precipitation reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs in aqueous solution and form precipitates.\x1b[0m Further, chemical reactions consist of chemical changes that take place within the substances. Thus, it gives rise to a new element under some particular conditions. Moreover, chemical reactions occur between two or more chemical compounds that we refer to as reactants. Thus, the reactants can be in forms of solid, gas or liquid. What is Precipitation Reaction? It means the chemical reaction occurs in aqueous solutions where two ions bond together to form insoluble salts. These insoluble salts formed are precipitates that are the products of it. They can be single displacement reactions or double displacement reactions. In a double displacement reaction, both ionic reactants dissociate in water and their ions bonds with the respective cation or anion from the other reactant. ', 'https://byjus.com/chemistry/precipitation-reaction/\nThe formation of a precipitate also suggests the presence of a chemical reaction. When a silver nitrate solution is poured into a sodium chloride solution, a chemical reaction occurs, producing a white silver chloride precipitate. Q3 What is an example of formation of precipitate? When a silver nitrate solution is poured into a sodium chloride solution, a chemical reaction occurs, producing a white silver chloride precipitate. A yellow lead(II) iodide precipitate is formed when the potassium iodide solution reacts with the lead(II) nitrate solution. Q4 Is Salt a precipitate? \x1b[92m[2] The insoluble salt falling out of the solution is referred to as the precipitate, hence the name of the reaction.\x1b[0m Precipitation reactions in the solution can help determine the identity of different ions. Q5 What factors affect precipitation? ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)\n\x1b[92m[9] In an aqueous solution, precipitation is the 'sedimentation of a solid material (a precipitate) from a liquid solution'.\x1b[0m The solid formed is called the precipitate. In case of an inorganic chemical reaction leading to precipitation, the chemical reagent causing the solid to form is called the precipitant. The clear liquid remaining above the precipitated or the centrifuged solid phase is also called the supernate or supernatant. The notion of precipitation can also be extended to other domains of chemistry (organic chemistry and biochemistry) and even be applied to the solid phases (e.g. metallurgy and alloys) when solid impurities segregate from a solid phase. Supersaturation Main article: Supersaturation The precipitation of a compound may occur when its concentration exceeds its solubility. This can be due to temperature changes, solvent evaporation, or by mixing solvents. Precipitation occurs more rapidly from a strongly supersaturated solution. "", ""https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/backgrounders/evidence-chemical-change\nIn some chemical reactions, the gas produced can be highly toxic. This can happen at home if certain cleaning products are mixed together. Breathing the gas created from mixing some cleaning products can even result in death. This is why you should never use two different cleaning products together - ever! \x1b[92m[6] Precipitate Formation Sometimes when two solutions undergo a chemical reaction, one of the new products formed from the reaction is not soluble.\x1b[0m This means that it is not able to dissolve in the new solution. Instead, we can observe a solid that is distinct and separate from the solution. We call this solid a precipitate. You have probably heard the word 'precipitation', but maybe not when talking about chemistry. We also use the word precipitation to refer to the types of water that fall from the sky. The solid in a precipitation reaction also often falls, or sinks, to the bottom of the solution. Precipitation reactions are all double replacement reactions.

This post outlines a four-step process, emphasizing taking notes in class, summarizing, and reviewing notes for optimal understanding.The Cornell format includes a header section, a summary section, a main notetaking section, and a cue section.  We’ve provided some practical tips, such as using short sentences, abbreviations, and symbols for efficient notetaking. The method's benefits include focused learning, easy notetaking, clear and structured notes, and enhanced skimming ability.However, there are some drawbacks, such as the challenge of paraphrasing in real-time and the necessity of working within the method's structured framework. It is recommended that when using the Cornell Method of notetaking you complete the cue and summary sections soon after lectures to maximize recall benefits. Overall, the Cornell Method proves beneficial for lectures, independent study, and group sessions, offering a clear structure for effective learning and retention.

Consider splitting content into sub-articles, condensing it, or adding subheadings. Please discuss this issue on the article's talk page. \x1b[92m[1] (November 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this message) In the Germanic languages, a strong verb is a verb that marks its past tense by means of changes to the stem vowel.\x1b[0m The majority of the remaining verbs form the past tense by means of a dental suffix, are known as weak verbs, and outnumber strong verbs. "", 'https://blogs.transparent.com/german/weak-verbs-in-german/\nWeak Verbs in German Posted by Sandra Rösner on May 7, 2012 in Language In German, there are two basic forms of verbs: weak verbs and strong verbs. Weak verbs or regular verbs are those that follow a set pattern of rules and retain the same stem vowel throughout. These verbs are called weak verbs because you might think of them as being simply too weak to alter the patterns they follow – when they are conjugated. \x1b[92m[0] Strong verbs, on the other hand, do not follow a set pattern of conjugation, that is, the stem vowel will change when you, for example, form the past form of a strong verb.\x1b[0m When you are a native speaker of English you have already come across strong and weak verbs in your mother language. As mentioned above, German weak verbs are nothing else than English regular verbs (e.g. walk-walked-walked), and German strong verbs are nothing else than English irregular verbs (go-went-gone), so to speak. ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_strong_verb\nAs well as developing the strong verb system, Germanic also went on to develop two other classes of verbs: the weak verbs and a third, much smaller, class known as the preterite-present verbs, which are continued in the English auxiliary verbs, e.g. can/could, shall/should, may/might, must. Weak verbs originally derived from other types of word in PIE and originally occurred only in the present aspect. They did not have a perfect aspect, meaning that they came to lack a past tense in Germanic once the perfect had become the past[clarification needed]. Not having a past tense at all, they obviously also had no vowel alternations between present and past. To compensate for this, a new type of past tense was eventually created for these verbs by adding a -d- or -t- suffix to the stem. \x1b[92m[2] This is why only strong verbs have vowel alternations: their past tense forms descend from the original PIE perfect aspect, while the past tense forms of weak verbs were created later.\x1b[0m ']",how many strong verbs are there in german,"In the German language, there are approximately 200 strong verbs.

Just tell them to tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree.\x1b[92m[2] '– Penne Laingen The yellow ribbon refers to a popular song, 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,' written in 1972 and released in 1973 by the group Tony Orlando and Dawn.\x1b[0m It became a hit. Many artists subsequently covered the song, from Frank Sinatra to Dolly Parton. While the song itself has nothing to do with being taken hostage, it was a familiar tune that reminded the public of the hope and anticipation of welcoming a loved one home. After Penne Laingen’s suggestion in the interview, the yellow ribbon started to spread. It began with the other hostages’ families, and by the end of the crisis had become a cultural phenomenon. Penne Laingen was even asked to tie a yellow ribbon around the National Christmas Tree outside of the White House.

You say the name and it just reeks of avocado shag and Love’s Baby Soft. But what always struck me was the fact that this anonymous studio concoction, whose members weren’t even fully formed until after their first few hits, became such a visual presence and representation of the 70s. \x1b[92m[5] In fact, Tony Orlando & Dawn wasn’t even used until after seven Top 40 hits and two #1 song were racked up, including their biggest, Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree.\x1b[0m They actually had as many hits with their iconic name than without. I don’t think Tony Orlando minds at all because without this weird run of luck, he would have just been a guy who had a Top 20 hit called Bless You, way back in 1961.

In it, he substituted a yellow handkerchief for the white ribbon and an oak tree for the apple tree. Reader’s Digest reprinted Hamill’s story in 1972, and ABC-TV rushed out a feature starring James Earl Jones as the ex-con. \x1b[92m[1] The following year, Tony Orlando and Dawn released a smash hit with 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree.'\x1b[0m It’s hard to exaggerate just how popular this song was. Radio stations played it several times a day, every day, for months. It topped the charts in eight countries. And it hit with multiple generations, not just youth. I distinctly remember older aunts and uncles singing it when I was kid. Pete Hamill sued the songwriters, Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown, for copyright infringement. To no avail. The story wasn’t Hamill’s. It belonged to our collective folkloric imagination.

In the John Wayne film She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), a woman sported yellow to express her devotion to a cavalry officer. But there's no record of yellow ribbons appearing during the Korean War, the Vietnam War or any other conflict pre-1980.

He wrote his love, asking her to tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree in front of the house if she wanted him back. He asked the bus driver to look, as he feared there would be no ribbon. Bus passengers cheered after seeing 100 yellow ribbons tied around the tree. A woman told me that she’d tied a yellow ribbon around an old oak tree in her yard in the 1970s. A squirrel swiped the ribbon and tied it around an old squirrel nest. Chickadee chat Research showed that a chickadee’s brain grows up to 30 percent larger during times when they need to find food for caching. The brain expands, adding new nerve cells to help it remember where it had stored food. In the spring, when memory is less important, the brain shrinks to normal size.

He turned out to be very welcome: There were a hundred yellow ribbons.

It contains no blood supply of its own—which is why you can shave your skin and not cause any bleeding despite losing many cells in the process. Assuming, that is, you don’t nick your skin to deep, where the blood supply is actually found. The epidermis is itself divided into at least four separate parts. A fifth part is present in some areas of our body. In order from the deepest layer of the epidermis to the most superficial, these layers (strata) are the: Stratum basale Stratum spinosum Stratum granulosum Stratum lucidum Stratum corneum Skin overview: Skin layers, of both hairy and hairless skin. Stratum Basale Human skin: This image details the parts of the integumentary system. ', 'https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Biology/Human_Biology_(Wakim_and_Grewal)/13%3A_Integumentary_System/13.3%3A_Skin\nOnly on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, the next layer above the stratum granulosum is the stratum lucidum. This is a layer consisting of stacks of translucent, dead keratinocytes that provide extra protection to the underlying layers. Stratum Corneum The uppermost layer of the epidermis everywhere on the body is the stratum corneum. \x1b[92m[2] This layer is made of flat, hard, tightly packed dead keratinocytes that form a waterproof keratin barrier to protect the underlying layers of the epidermis.\x1b[0m Dead cells from this layer are constantly shed from the surface of the body. The shed cells are continually replaced by cells moving up from the lower layers of the epidermis. It takes a period of about 48 days for newly formed keratinocytes in the stratum basale to make their way to the top of the stratum corneum to replace shed cells. Functions of the Epidermis ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin\nThe epidermis contains no blood vessels, and cells in the deepest layers are nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air and to a far lesser degree by blood capillaries extending to the outer layers of the dermis. The main type of cells that make up the epidermis are Merkel cells, keratinocytes, with melanocytes and Langerhans cells also present. The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, and basale. Cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer. The daughter cells (see cell division) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off (desquamation). This process is called 'keratinization'. \x1b[92m[3] This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and pathogens out, making skin a natural barrier to infection.\x1b[0m "", 'https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Biology/Human_Biology_(Wakim_and_Grewal)/13%3A_Integumentary_System/13.3%3A_Skin\nThe epidermis is the outer of the two main layers of the skin, the inner layer being the dermis. It averages about 0.10 mm thick and is much thinner than the dermis. The epidermis is thinnest on the eyelids (0.05 mm) and thickest on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (1.50 mm). The epidermis covers almost the entire body surface. It is continuous with, but structurally distinct from, the mucous membranes that line the mouth, anus, urethra, and vagina. \x1b[92m[0] Structure of the Epidermis There are no blood vessels and very few nerve cells in the epidermis.\x1b[0m Without blood to bring epidermal cells oxygen and nutrients, the cells must absorb oxygen directly from the air and obtain nutrients via diffusion of fluids from the dermis below. However, as thin as it is, the epidermis still has a complex structure. It has a variety of cell types and multiple layers.

However, this correction is excessive and the Gregorian reform modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are. 1800 calendar, showing that February had only 28 days "", ""https://www.infoplease.com/calendars/months-seasons/leap-year-explained\nThe Gregorian calendar, which now serves as the standard calendar for civil use throughout the world, has both common years and leap years. A common year has 365 days and a leap year 366 days, with the extra— or intercalary— day designated as February 29. \x1b[92m[0] A leap year occurs every four years to help synchronize the calendar year with the solar year, or the length of time it takes to complete the Earth's orbit around the sun, which is about 365 days and a quarter of a day.\x1b[0m The length of the solar year, however, is slightly less than 365¼ days-by about 11 minutes. To compensate for this discrepancy, the leap year is omitted three times every four hundred years. In other words, a century year cannot be a leap year unless it is divisible by 400. Thus 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years. When Are Leap Years? "", ""https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/leap-year-explained\nThat surplus of 0.24 days might seem insignificant, but let it accumulate for a few centuries, and we’d find ourselves seriously out of sync with the seasons. 'Leap years, therefore, are essential to prevent this drift and maintain the alignment of our calendar with the Earth's journey around the Sun,' Kim says. \x1b[92m[1] undefined As 0.24 is approximately a quarter of a day, we add four of them together on 29 February in a leap year to keep in step.\x1b[0m Who invented leap years? This system of adding one day every four years was introduced by none other than the ancient leader of Rome, Julius Caesar, in the year 46 BC. Prior to this appropriately named Julian calendar, the Roman Empire had operated using a calendar with 355 days in a year. Instead of adding the occasional extra day, back then it was the job of the high priests in Rome to call a leap month whenever they felt things were getting out of phase.

256,322,"[""https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/elections/types-of-elections.html\nIn presidential elections, each major political party holds a national convention where they choose their nominee for president. The results of the primary election determine how votes from Pennsylvania are cast at the convention. The nominees from each party run against each other in the general election in November. \x1b[92m[1] The president is officially elected by the Electoral College, not by popular vote.\x1b[0m But the popular vote – including your vote – helps determine which candidate receives Pennsylvania's electoral votes. About the Electoral College The U.S. Constitution created the Electoral College to ensure that each state has a role in selecting the president, no matter its population. Each state has the same number of electoral votes as it has members of Congress. There are a total of 538 votes in the Electoral College. A candidate must win a simple majority--270 electoral votes-- to win the election. "", ""https://votesmart.org/education/elections\nc. Runoff Primary - if no candidate gets a majority of the votes, a runoff is held to decide who should win. d. Presidential Primary - a primary used to pick delegates to the presidential nominating conventions of the major parties. \x1b[92m[0] Election Vocabulary Electoral College - A group of persons called 'electors,' selected by the voters in each state, that officially elects the president and vice president.\x1b[0m The number of electors in each states is equal to its number of representatives in both houses of Congress.

Office-Block Ballot "", 'https://ourwhitehouse.org/getting-the-votes-and-getting-elected-the-popular-vote-vs-the-electoral-college/\n\x1b[92m[3] When the delegates at the Constitutional Convention decided to create an Electoral College to choose the president, their vision for how this group would work was somewhat idealistic.\x1b[0m In their minds, electors would be educated and distinguished citizens of each state who would be free to consider each presidential candidate. They envisioned that the electors would carefully discuss the qualifications of each candidate and engage in vigorous debate before casting their votes and sending them to Congress. And in our country’s early elections the Electoral College did work this way because electors were chosen either by the state legislatures or by popular vote within each state. However, the development and rising power of political parties transformed this process from the Fathers’ idealistic vision. Over time, electors were no longer chosen for their distinction as citizens, but for their loyalty to a particular party. Today, electors are chosen at state party conventions or are appointed directly by party leaders. Each major party elects or appoints the same number of electors as the state has electoral votes. So, when the electors chosen in the November election meet in their respective state capitols in December, there is no vigorous debate about the presidential candidates’ qualifications—the electors simply vote for their party’s candidate. ', 'https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-electoral-votes-are-counted-presidential-election\nWhat is the Electoral College, and how many votes are needed to win? \x1b[92m[2] The Electoral College is the body that elects the president and vice president of the United States every four years.\x1b[0m It is established by Article II of the Constitution, which also provides that each state may select a number of electors equal to the number of its U.S. representatives and senators. The 23rd Amendment, ratified in 1961, assigns three additional electors to the District of Columbia, bringing the total number of electors to 538. To win, a presidential ticket must obtain a majority — 270 if all electors vote. Otherwise, the 12th Amendment provides that the House of Representatives chooses the president, with each state delegation receiving one vote, and the Senate chooses the vice president by majority vote.
