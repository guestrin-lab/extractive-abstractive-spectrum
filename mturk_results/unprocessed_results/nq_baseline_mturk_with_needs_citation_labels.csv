408,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_Act\n\x1b[92m[1] The Currency Act or Paper Bills of Credit Act is one of several Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain that regulated paper money issued by the colonies of British America\x1b[0m. The Acts sought to protect British merchants and creditors from being paid in depreciated colonial currency. The policy created tension between the colonies and Great Britain and was cited as a grievance by colonists early in the American Revolution. However, the consensus view among modern economic historians and economists is that the debts by colonists to British merchants were not a major cause of the Revolution. In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that 92% of economists and 74% of historians disagreed with the statement, 'The debts owed by colonists to British merchants and other private citizens constituted one of the most powerful causes leading to the Revolution.' Economic climate of the colonies "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_Act\n\x1b[96m[2] The first Act, the Currency Act 1751 (24 Geo\x1b[0m. \x1b[96m[3] 2. c. 53), restricted the issue of paper money and the establishment of new public banks by the colonies of New England\x1b[0m. These colonies had issued paper fiat money known as 'bills of credit' to help pay for military expenses during the French and Indian Wars. Because more paper money was issued than what was taxed out of circulation, the currency depreciated in relation to the British pound sterling. The resultant inflation was harmful to merchants in Great Britain, who were forced to accept the depreciated currency from colonists for payment of debts. The Act limited the future issue of bills of credit to certain circumstances. It allowed the existing bills to be used as legal tender for public debts (i.e. paying taxes), but did not allow their use for private debts (e.g. for paying merchants). Act of 1764 "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_Act\n\x1b[95m[4] The Currency Act 1764 (4 Geo\x1b[0m. \x1b[95m[5] 3. c. 34) extended the 1751 Act to all of the British colonies of North America\x1b[0m. Unlike the earlier Act, this statute did not prohibit the colonies from issuing paper money, but it did forbid them from designating future currency issues as legal tender for public and private debts. This tight money policy created financial difficulties in the colonies, where gold and silver were in short supply. \x1b[95m[6] Benjamin Franklin, a colonial agent in London, lobbied for repeal of the Act over the next several years, as did other agents\x1b[0m. The act arose when Virginia farmers continued to import during the French and Indian War. Virginia issued Â£250,000 in bills of credit to finance both public and private debts. This legislation differed from the 1751 act in that it prohibited the colonists from designating paper currency for use as payment for any debts, public or private. Parliament did not, however, prohibit the colonists from issuing paper money. The Act was put into place as a hedge against risks associated with economic fluctuations and uncertainty.

To write in Plain English, we are told to use a series of techniques such as '\x1b[92m[2] use short sentences\x1b[0m' and sometimes given lists of words to avoid. This version of âplainâ originated with Ernest Gowersâ Plain Words, a pamphlet commissioned by the Treasury (a government department) in 1948 that was supplemented by a second pamphlet The ABC of Plain Words in 1951, and then got combined into a single book The Complete Plain Words in 1954. You get the flavour of Gowers in this excerpt: Utilise and Utilisation These words are rarely needed, for the simple word use will almost always serve. The official (not a Government official) who wrote 'This document is forwarded herewith for the favour of your utilisation' might have written 'please use this form'. That says what needed to be said in four syllables instead of 21. Gowers, 1954 "", 'https://www.effortmark.co.uk/why-plain-language-and-plain-english-are-different/\nPlain language relies on testing with users. If the intended users can use the content to do what they need to do, itâs plain. If they canât, itâs not plain. So you can only really know whether you have succeeded in writing in plain language when you have tested with the actual users. Plain language is much more flexible. For example, in Plain English there are lists of forbidden words. But in plain language, we accept that itâs OK to use the words that these users are familiar with. For example, when Iâm writing for farmers about farm animals such as cows and pigs, I choose the word âlivestockâ because thatâs the one that farmers use. Be careful when you search and link Does it matter whether we talk about âPlain Englishâ or âplain languageâ? Not really: when talking to users, either is fine. ', ""https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html\nBut in the last few years, many of these offenders have started to put things right, either rewriting their documents clearly or training their staff in the art of plain English, or both. The main advantages of plain English are: \x1b[95m[3] it is faster to write; it is faster to read; and you get your message across more often, more easily and in a friendlier way\x1b[0m. If you spend more than an hour a day writing, you are to an extent a professional writer. So it's vital that you get it right. So what is plain English? It is a message, written with the reader in mind and with the right tone of voice, that is clear and concise.

Prior to 1984, the legal age when alcohol could be purchased in America varied from state to state. \x1b[92m[0] According to the CDC, after all states uniformly increased the legal drinking age to 21, they consequently saw a 16% median decline in motor vehicle crashes.After the enactment of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, states also saw a decrease in the binge drinking behavior of Americans under the age of 25.\x1b[0m Drinking during the previous month declined from 59% in 1985 to 40% in 1991 among Americans aged 18 to 20 years old. Drinking among people aged 21 to 25 declined from 70% in 1985 to 56% in 1991, the CDC reports. And according to the World Health Organization, those who avoid alcohol at a younger age are less likely to develop drinking problems later in life.In the decades since 1991, however, America has seen several problematic trends emerge in the drinking culture of its youth.

He is known for his wild, maniacal laughter. \x1b[92m[0] The Lion King Ed (left) and Banzai (right) In The Lion King, Ed tags along with the other two hyenas in the trio, Shenzi and Banzai.\x1b[0m When the hyenas first meet Simba and Nala in the Elephant Graveyard, Ed is the first to notice their escape. Ed nodded frantically when asked if he knew Simba was Mufasa's son, a fact that the other two hyenas tried to hide when cornered by Mufasa. He also made a low, sinister laugh when the hyenas overhear Scar say that the hyenas were the real enemy. \x1b[92m[3] The Lion King 1Â½ Along with Shenzi and Banzai, Ed appears in The Lion King 1Â½ in the beginning when the trio of hyenas attack Timon and at the end when Simba tries to retake the Pride Lands from Scar.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] Songs Be Prepared Trivia Ed is the only hyena with a name that does not have a meaning in Swahili.\x1b[0m "", ""https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai,_and_Ed\n\x1b[92m[2] The Lion King[] While hyenas were a common enemy in the Lion King SNES release, none of the hyenas fought were Shenzi, Banzai, or Ed.\x1b[0m Even the end-of-level boss hyena on the first level was not one of them. Once defeated, each hyena performed Ed's drooling 'salute' briefly before collapsing, but these hyenas lacked Ed's bitten ears. Banzai appears at the end of the 'Simba's Exile' level, but only to deliver his line 'If you ever come back, we'll kill ya!' The Lion King: Activity Center[] Ed appears in the 'Shadowlands' (referring clearly to Elephant Graveyard) section, mostly in two of its games: the Xylobone (he serves sometimes as the player's opponent, or he may let him or her play it freely) and the Stone Card Matching game (as one of three possible movie-exclusive character opponents, the other two being Simba and Nala). He also seems to appear in the maze game, but no hyena is ever specified there. \x1b[92m[5] The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure[]\x1b[0m "", ""https://thelionkingstimonandpumbaa.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed\n\x1b[92m[6] The three hyenas made occasional appearances in the TV series The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa.\x1b[0m While Jim Cummings reprised his role as Ed, Tress MacNeille and Rob Paulsen replaced Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin. The hyenas were also more noticeably dim-witted in the series in comparison to the movies. In addition, for unexplained reasons, they somehow managed to learn how to stand on their hind legs and are able to talk to humans. The hyenas had four 'skits' in which they starred, usually trying to get an easy meal. These were called 'The Laughing Hyenas'. "", 'https://screenrant.com/disney-lion-king-scar-chose-3-worst-hyenas/\n\x1b[92m[8] The names of the Lion Kingâs three most notable hyenas are Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, with Shenzi being the most intelligent of the three, followed by Banzai (though he has a vicious appetite and lack of true loyalty that makes him dangerous), and finally Ed, whoâs arguably more of a liability than an asset.\x1b[0m The three were introduced in the Lion King as Scarâs secret henchman during Mufasaâs reign, and Scar used them to orchestrate Mufasaâs death in a way that made Simba think it was his fault before ordering them to do the final bit of dirty work for him and kill Simba (which, again, they failed to do). After that, Scar made them his lieutenants when he took over Pride Rock as king, and invited the rest of the hyenas to leave the Elephant Graveyard and join together with the lions in a position of authority. Until Simba came back and reclaimed his rightful place as king, the hyenas had it pretty good. As it turns out, their relatively good fortune under Scar was all thanks to the hyenaâs original queen, who initially allowed Scar to recruit three of her subjects for his power-hungry plot. More specifically, she allowed Scar to recruit the three hyenas who were the most expendable.

While still as vicious and threatening as they are in the movie, the hyenas become more neutral as the show progresses. Though they are at first shown to be more dim-witted in comparison to the original film, they become wiser near the end of their first appearance and in later episodes, often coming up with clever ways to get their meal, though many of them end in failure. The hyenas have their own segments titled 'The Laughing Hyenas', which involve the trio searching for food after running away from the Pride Lands. Outside of their own segments, they appeared in flashbacks in 'Doubt of Africa' and 'Once Upon a Timon' and made a non-speaking appearance in 'Space Ham'. "", ""https://thelionkingstimonandpumbaa.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed\n\x1b[92m[9] His name means 'skulk' or 'lurk' in Swahili.\x1b[0m It can also mean 'die with honor' or 'ten thousand years' in Japanese, possibly a reference to his aggressive nature but more likely coincidental. His most distinguishing feature is his unusually heavy eyebrows. Apart from these, he is the model for most generic hyenas. He is the greediest of the three, frequently making references to being hungry, and asking for food. He also usually speaks and acts without thinking, losing his temper with Ed twice, and complaining when the Pride Lands lacks food under Scar's rule ('It's dinnertime, and we ain't got no stinkin' entrees!'). He even quietly remarks to his friends that Mufasa was a better king than Scar. In addition, when about to commence the Wildebeest Stampede, he almost tried to kill and eat a sick Wildebeest before Scar gave them the signal, but was stopped by Shenzi, reminding him about waiting for Scar's signal. "", ""https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai,_and_Ed\nBanzai seems to have bad luck and tends to take the injuries. His buttocks are severely lacerated by Mufasa's sharp claws, causing him great pain when he sits ('I won't be able to sit for a week!'). In 'Be Prepared', Banzai is fired out of a geyser and handled roughly by Scar. Then when he and the others chase Simba out of the Pride Lands, Banzai is knocked into the thorns and ends up with many in his body. \x1b[92m[4] Ed (voiced by Jim Cummings) is the only hyena without a Swahili name, though there exists in English the word eddy meaning whirlpool.\x1b[0m Ed's distinguishing features are two round cuts on each ear, his tongue often lolls from his mouth and he doesn't have eyebrows. \x1b[92m[10] He doesn't speak and instead communicates through laughter, which he also seems to have difficulty holding back.\x1b[0m Jim Cummings recorded over four hours of various laughter clips for any situation Ed might be in; excited, amused, angry, etc. ""]",what is the name of the hyena in lion king,"The name of the hyena in ""The Lion King"" is Ed [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m[92m[8][0m[92m[9][0m.

411,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fool_on_the_Hill\n'The Fool on the Hill' is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 EP and album Magical Mystery Tour. It was written and sung by Paul McCartney and credited to the LennonâMcCartney partnership. \x1b[92m[3] The lyrics describe the titular 'fool', a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise.\x1b[0m McCartney said the idea for the song was inspired by the Dutch design collective the Fool, who derived their name from the tarot card of the same name, and possibly by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The song's segment in the Magical Mystery Tour television film was shot separately from the rest of the film and without the other Beatles' knowledge. Accompanied by a professional cameraman, McCartney filmed the scene near Nice in France. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fool_on_the_Hill\nIn 1968, SÃ©rgio Mendes & Brasil '66 recorded a cover version of the song that reached the top ten in the US. By the late 1970s, 'The Fool on the Hill' was one of McCartney's most widely recorded ballads. A solo demo and an outtake of the song were included on the Beatles' 1996 compilation album Anthology 2. \x1b[92m[1] Background and lyrics The song's lyrics describe the titular 'fool', a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise.\x1b[0m In his authorised biography, Many Years from Now, Paul McCartney says he first got the idea for the premise from the Dutch design collective the Fool, who were the Beatles' favourite designers in 1967 and told him that they had derived their name from the Tarot card of the same name. According to McCartney, the song possibly relates to a character such as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Beatles' meditation teacher: "", ""https://www.movement.org.uk/blog/beatles-fool-hill\nIn 1967, The Beatles released their album Magical Mystery Tour, which marked the peak of the bandâs collective fascination with Hinduism and psychedelics. \x1b[92m[4] For this album Paul McCartney penned his song The Fool on the Hill, which follows the story of a misunderstood man who is perceived by others as foolish but is, in fact, encapsulated by wisdom.\x1b[0m The song was written about spiritual master, Maharishi,\u202fwith whom he and the other Beatles had bonded in India. However, feelings for Maharishi shifted a year later when the band recorded a âdiss trackâ titled Sexy Sadie in which John Lennon accuses Maharishi of breaking 'the rules' and making 'a fool of everyone' who loves him. This followed an alleged inappropriate advance on actress Mia Farrow by Maharishi.

It was written and sung by Paul McCartney and credited to the LennonâMcCartney partnership. \x1b[92m[2] The lyrics describe the titular 'fool', a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise.\x1b[0m McCartney said the idea for the song was inspired by the Dutch design collective the Fool, who derived their name from the tarot card of the same name, and possibly by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The songâs segment in the Magical Mystery Tour television film was shot separately from the rest of the film and without the other Beatlesâ knowledge. Accompanied by a professional cameraman, McCartney filmed the scene near Nice in France.

By the late 1970s, 'The Fool on the Hill' was one of McCartneyâs most widely recorded ballads. A solo demo and an outtake of the song were included on the Beatlesâ 1996 compilation album Anthology 2. \x1b[92m[0] Background and lyrics The songâs lyrics describe the titular 'fool', a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise.\x1b[0m In his authorised biography, Many Years from Now, Paul McCartney says he first got the idea for the premise from the Dutch design collective the Fool, who were the Beatlesâ favourite designers in 1967 and told him that they had derived their name from the Tarot card of the same name. According to McCartney, the song possibly relates to a character such as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Beatlesâ meditation teacher: "", 'https://dogdodgingrabbit.wordpress.com/2016/12/09/insanity-in-isolation-an-interpretive-analysis-of-brain-damage-and-eclipse-by-pink-floyd/\nAnd if the dam breaks open many years too soon And if there is no room on the hill And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too Iâll see you on the dark side of the moon âIâll see you on the dark side of the moonâ, says the narrator, if the preceding happens to you.

Permits for concealed carrying in public are issued sparingly.[note 2] \x1b[92m[3] The acquisition of fully automatic weapons, suppressors and target lasers requires special permits issued by the cantonal firearms office\x1b[0m.

Regulation Switzerland's Weapons Law (WG, LArm) and Weapons Act (WV, OArm) has been revised to accede to the Schengen Treaty effective 12 December 2008, and modified in 2019 after a referendum from the Swiss population to implement the European Firearms Directive which was added in the Schengen agreement. The Act on Personal Military Equipment (VPAA, OEPM) governs the handling of military equipment, and in particular the handling of personal weapons by military personnel. The law is applied to the following weapons: Firearms, such as pistols, revolvers, rifles, pump guns (German: Vorderschaftrepetierer), lever-action rifles, self-loading guns (shotguns and rifles). Air and CO2 guns with a muzzle energy of at least 7.5 joules, or if there is risk of confusion with a firearm. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland\nIn order to purchase most weapons, the purchaser must obtain a weapon acquisition permit (art. 8 WG/LArm). Swiss citizens and foreigners with a C permit over the age of 18 who are not under a curator nor identified as being a danger for themselves or others, and who do not have a criminal record with a conviction for a violent crime or of several convictions as long as they haven't been written out can request such a permit. Foreign nationals who do not have a settlement permit but who are resident in Switzerland must present the competent cantonal authority with an official attestation from their home country confirming they are authorised to acquire the weapon or essential weapon component in that country in order to buy (art. 9a WG/LArm). Foreigners with citizenship to the following countries are explicitly excluded from the right to buy, sell and own weapons and their parts unless they ask for an exceptional authorization to the state: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania.[note 1] ""]",,,,3.0,3.0,307,KHdznSlY7WjzguP,3,3,"[1.57812333106995,2.44555592536926,2.19728970527649]","[19.4268851280212,14.6954863071442,16.1264660358429]",2024-09-03 19:17:19.521989+00,"[{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":0},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":1},{""annotations"":[1],""sentence_id"":2}]","[{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":0},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":1},{""coverage"":1,""sentence_id"":2}]","[True, True, True]"

When working with more than one event, you have to be concerned as to whether the first event affects the second event. When determining if events are independent, you are determining if the events are affecting one another. \x1b[92m[6] Independent Events Two events are said to be independent if the result of the second event is not affected by the result of the first event.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] The probability of one event does not change the probability of the other event.\x1b[0m If A and B are independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events. If A and B are independent events, "", 'https://www.cuemath.com/data/independent-events/\nIf the probability of events A and B is P(A) and P(B) respectively, then the two events are independent if any of the following are true: P(A|B)=P(A), P(B|A)=P(B) and P(A and B)=P(A)âP(B) How Do You Tell if an Event Is Independent or Dependent? \x1b[92m[0] Two events A and B are said to be independent if the fact that one event has occurred does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other.\x1b[0m Also if the occurrence of one event affects the probability of occurrence of the other event, then the two events are said to be dependent. Can an Event Be Mutually Exclusive and Independent Event? Mutually exclusive in math are a set of events that cannot happen at the same time. For example: when tossing a coin, the result can either be heads or tails but cannot be both. This of course means mutually exclusive events are not independent, and independent events cannot be mutually exclusive. Are Independent Events Disjoint? ', 'https://byjus.com/maths/independent-events/\nIndependent events are those events whose occurrence is not dependent on any other event. For example, if we flip a coin in the air and get the outcome as Head, then again if we flip the coin but this time we get the outcome as Tail. In both cases, the occurrence of both events is independent of each other. It is one of the types of events in probability. Let us learn here the complete definition of independent events along with its Venn diagram, examples and how it is different from mutually exclusive events. What are Independent Events? In Probability, the set of outcomes of an experiment is called events. There are different types of events such as independent events, dependent events, mutually exclusive events, and so on. \x1b[92m[2] If the probability of occurrence of an event A is not affected by the occurrence of another event B, then A and B are said to be independent events.\x1b[0m ', ""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conditional_probability.asp\n\x1b[92m[1] Two events are said to be independent if one event occurring does not affect the probability that the other event will occur.\x1b[0m However, if one event occurring (or not occurring) does affect the likelihood that the other event will happen, the two events are said to be dependent. An example of dependent events is a company's stock price increasing after the company reports higher-than-expected earnings. If events are independent, then the probability of event B occurring is not contingent on what happens with event A. For example, an increase in Apple's shares has nothing to do with a drop in wheat prices. Conditional probability is often written as the 'probability of A given B' and notated as P(A|B).

The play is one of a triad of tragedies known as the three Theban plays, following Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus. \x1b[92m[1] Even though the events in Antigone occur last in the order of events depicted in the plays, Sophocles wrote Antigone first.\x1b[0m The story expands on the Theban legend that predates it, and it picks up where Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes ends. The play is named after the main protagonist Antigone. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles\n\x1b[92m[4] Sophocles[a] (c. 497/496 â winter 406/405 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, known as one of three from whom at least one play has survived in full.\x1b[0m His first plays were written later than, or contemporary with, those of Aeschylus; and earlier than, or contemporary with, those of Euripides. \x1b[92m[2] Sophocles wrote over 120 plays, but only seven have survived in a complete form: Ajax, Antigone, Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra, Philoctetes, and Oedipus at Colonus.\x1b[0m For almost fifty years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens which took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. He competed in thirty competitions, won twenty-four, and was never judged lower than second place. Aeschylus won thirteen competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles; Euripides won four. ', 'https://femminaclassica.com/analyzing-antigone/\nTo begin to understand the psyche of Antigone, it is important to get a grasp from whence she came. Because mythology was ubiquitous to the ancient Greeks, the audience would have been all too familiar with Oedipusâs woeful tale and the cursed Laius family. Frequently performed in mythological sequence, Sophoclesâ Theban sagaâ-Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigoneâ- was written out of sequence and therefore not considered a trilogy in the manner of Aeschylusâ Oresteia. Each play of the Theban saga is a unit unto itself. \x1b[92m[3] Although the events in Antigone come last in the saga, in actuality, Sophocles wrote Antigone first (in about 442 BCE), preceding Oedipus the King by about twelve years.\x1b[0m Thus, the Creon in Antigone has an altogether different persona than the Creon in Oedipus the King.

First-time director John Lasseter sensed a chance to make a different kind of animated film, with jokes designed to appeal to an adult audience, and an emotional resonance that had been missing in traditional animation. Lasseter knew it would require songs a cut above the usual fare in terms of sophistication, as he told Entertainment Weekly in 1995: '[Newmanâs] songs are touching, witty and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.'

He is the longest-tenured character on the show, appearing in 19 seasons. He has appeared in 405 episodes of Law & Order, four episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, two episodes of Law & Order: Trial by Jury, two episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street, and the made-for-TV movie Exiled.[citation needed] Waterston's performance as McCoy on the New Yorkâbased series was so popular that it resulted in him being declared a 'Living Landmark' by the New York Landmarks Conservancy, along with fellow longtime series cast member Jerry Orbach (who portrayed the popular police detective Lennie Briscoe for almost 12 years).

McCoy's appearance on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit on the November 13, 2007, episode 'Blinded', marked his first appearance in the Law & Order universe as district attorney.

A reference to 'the new DA' in a 2013 SVU episode would indicate that McCoy had moved on from the position presumably sometime in 2012; his replacement was unnamed. However, McCoy was the DA again as of 2018, showing up in the SVU episode 'The Undiscovered Country'.

It was released by Interscope Records, Sony and Ultra on 16 February 2017 as the lead single from Kygo's debut extended play Stargazing (2017) and it appears as an international bonus track on Gomez's third studio album, Rare (2020). The song was written by Kygo, Gomez, Brian Lee, Ali Tamposi, and Andrew Watt and produced by Kygo, Watt and Louis Bell. An EDM, dance-pop, electropop and tropical house song, 'It Ain't Me' comprises an acoustic guitar line, and a build-drop arrangement in its chorus featuring pulsing piano notes, bass, synthesizers, finger-snap claps and pan flute melodies. Gomez sings the track in a husky tone, while in the chorus her vocals are reduced to recurring syllables. The lyrics narrate a past relationship ruined by alcoholism. The lyrics to 'It Ain't Me' were written by Andrew Watt, Brian Lee and Ali Tamposi. With Watt previously working with Kygo, the DJ's manager Myles Shear contacted Watt for a session with Kygo which Watt also facilitated for Lee and Tamposi. During their session for 'It Ain't Me', they initially found the track very poor, but were trying to salvage it. Kygo and Shear suggested that they continue working on the song. After Kygo and Shear had left, Tamposi told Watt and Lee to play guitar and 'Fleetwood Mac it', spawning a 45-minute jam session as well as the demo of 'It Ain't Me', a simple acoustic guitar recording with Tamposi on vocals. Watt, Lee and Tamposi then asked Kygo to return to their studio to hear 'It Ain't Me' for a second time. Tamposi recalled, 'When they pushed the space bar to play the song, [Kygo] went from this very sweet, polite, charming young man to this super-human producer guy. I was watching his eyes go back, left and right, just mapping out how he envisioned the production of the song. He was extremely excited'. Lee and Tamposi then left for Kygo and Watt to work on the production where they followed the melodies and message of the demo. According to Tamposi, the producers brought the song to life.

It was released by Interscope Records, Sony and Ultra on 16 February 2017 as the lead single from Kygo's debut extended play Stargazing (2017) and it appears as an international bonus track on Gomez's third studio album, Rare (2020). The song was written by Kygo, Gomez, Brian Lee, Ali Tamposi, and Andrew Watt and produced by Kygo, Watt and Louis Bell. An EDM, dance-pop, electropop and tropical house song, 'It Ain't Me' comprises an acoustic guitar line, and a build-drop arrangement in its chorus featuring pulsing piano notes, bass, synthesizers, finger-snap claps and pan flute melodies. Gomez sings the track in a husky tone, while in the chorus her vocals are reduced to recurring syllables. The lyrics narrate a past relationship ruined by alcoholism.

260,"[""https://jimgoldenlaw.com/exploring-alabamas-stand-your-ground-law-implications-for-self-defense-cases/\n\x1b[92m[0] Alabamaâs 'stand your ground' does allow you to use force (and even 'deadly force') in defending yourself and your family without the obligation to retreat when faced with any perceived threat that could do you harm.\x1b[0m This currently complex law was enacted in 2006 but has been the subject of much debate. This 'stand your ground law' has been used in numerous high-profile court cases. Many of the citizens of Alabama feel the law is fair. Still, critics often argue that it gives you far too much leeway to utilize deadly force and that it may disproportionately affect minorities. The lawâs proponents say it is a necessary and soundly based legal tool for self-defense and is applied justly in most cases. The 'stand your ground' law in Alabama, in many ways, transformed the legal approach in self-defense cases. For example, if you believe you are in imminent threat of severe bodily harm or death, you should be able to use deadly or physical force in your defense. "", ""https://giffords.org/lawcenter/state-laws/stand-your-ground-in-alabama/\nSelf-defense laws in the US typically justify a personâs use of lethal force in public in situations where lethal force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or another person. Traditionally, these laws have been clear that taking human life is not necessary, and is therefore not justified, if the person could have avoided using lethal violence by retreating, or simply stepping away from a confrontation. A person does not have a duty to retreat from a conflict before using force in their home, however (known as the Castle Doctrine).1 Stand your ground laws upend centuries of legal tradition, allowing a person to use deadly force in self-defense in public, even if that force can be safely avoided by retreating or when nonlethal force would suffice. \x1b[92m[1] Alabama LawAlabama has adopted a stand your ground statute that removes the duty to retreat before using deadly force 'in any place where [a person] has the right to be.\x1b[0m'2MEDIA REQUESTSOur experts can speak to the full spectrum of gun violence prevention issues.

It provides that a person does not have a duty to retreat prior to the use of deadly force. \x1b[92m[2] Furthermore, Section 503.055 provides that a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where they have a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand their ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if the person reasonably believes that this is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to someone else or them, or to prevent the commission of a felony involving the use of force.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/stand-your-ground-laws-50-state-survey/\nMinnesota generally imposes a duty to retreat.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: 'Von' â news Â· newspapers Â· books Â· scholar Â· JSTOR (April 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The term von ([fÉn] â) is used in German surnames either as a nobiliary particle indicating a noble patrilineality, or as a simple preposition used by commoners that means 'of' or 'from'. Nobility directories like the Almanach de Gotha often abbreviate the noble term von to v. In medieval or early modern names, the von particle was at times added to commoners' names; thus, Hans von Duisburg meant 'Hans from [the city of] Duisburg'. This meaning is preserved in Swiss toponymic surnames and in the Dutch van, which is a cognate of von but also does not necessarily indicate nobility. Usage Germany and Austria The abolition of the monarchies in Germany and Austria in 1919 meant that neither state has a privileged nobility, and both have exclusively republican governments. In Germany, this means that legally von simply became an ordinary part of the surnames of the people who used it. There are no longer any legal privileges or constraints associated with this naming convention. According to German alphabetical sorting, people with von in their surnames â of noble or non-noble descent alike â are listed in telephone books and other files under the rest of their names (e.g., the economist Ludwig von Mises would have been found under M in the phone book rather than V). In Austria, in contrast, not only were the privileges of the nobility abolished, their titles and prepositions were abolished as well in 1919.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: 'Von' â news Â· newspapers Â· books Â· scholar Â· JSTOR (April 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The term von ([fÉn] â) is used in German surnames either as a nobiliary particle indicating a noble patrilineality, or as a simple preposition used by commoners that means 'of' or 'from'. Nobility directories like the Almanach de Gotha often abbreviate the noble term von to v. In medieval or early modern names, the von particle was at times added to commoners' names; thus, Hans von Duisburg meant 'Hans from [the city of] Duisburg'. This meaning is preserved in Swiss toponymic surnames and in the Dutch van, which is a cognate of von but also does not necessarily indicate nobility. Usage Germany and Austria The abolition of the monarchies in Germany and Austria in 1919 meant that neither state has a privileged nobility, and both have exclusively republican governments. In Germany, this means that legally von simply became an ordinary part of the surnames of the people who used it. There are no longer any legal privileges or constraints associated with this naming convention. According to German alphabetical sorting, people with von in their surnames â of noble or non-noble descent alike â are listed in telephone books and other files under the rest of their names (e.g., the economist Ludwig von Mises would have been found under M in the phone book rather than V). In Austria, in contrast, not only were the privileges of the nobility abolished, their titles and prepositions were abolished as well in 1919. Thus, for example, Friedrich von Hayek became simply Friedrich Hayek. (See also Austrian nobility on this issue.)

Article III, Section I states that '\x1b[92m[1] The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish\x1b[0m.' Although the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court, it permits Congress to decide how to organize it. Congress first exercised this power in the Judiciary Act of 1789. This Act created a Supreme Court with six justices. It also established the lower federal court system. The Justices Over the years, various Acts of Congress have altered the number of seats on the Supreme Court, from a low of five to a high of 10. Shortly after the Civil War, the number of seats on the Court was fixed at nine. Today, there is one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Like all federal judges, justices are appointed by the President and are confirmed by the Senate. They, typically, hold office for life. The salaries of the justices cannot be decreased during their term of office. These restrictions are meant to protect the independence of the judiciary from the political branches of government.

Released as a single two months after the film's premiere, it became a worldwide hit, reaching the Top 10 in several countries. The song became one of Dylan's most popular and most covered post-1960s compositions, spawning covers from Eric Clapton, Guns N' Roses, Randy Crawford, and more. Described by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin as 'an exercise in splendid simplicity', the song features two short verses, the lyrics of which comment directly on the scene in the film for which it was written: the death of a frontier lawman (Slim Pickens) who refers to his wife (Katy Jurado) as 'Mama'. It was ranked number 190 in 2004 by Rolling Stone magazine, in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and number 192 in 2010. Musicians Bob Dylan: vocals, guitar In January 1975 Eric Clapton played on Arthur Louis's recording of 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' which was arranged in a cross-over reggae style. After the recording sessions with Louis, Clapton recorded his own version of the song which was released as a single in August 1975 two weeks after Louis's version. This version was released on Timepieces: The Best of Eric Clapton. Clapton's version made it to No. 38 on the UK charts, but the single was less successful in the U.S. where it failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 (although it reached on No. 109 on Cashbox's Looking Ahead chart). Clapton's 1996 boxed set Crossroads 2: Live in the Seventies features a performance of the song recorded in London in April 1977. There were also performances of the song included on the Journeyman (1990) and the One More Car, One More Rider (2003) world tours. Several Clapton compilation albums also feature the song.

The pull-tab was revolutionary for can drinkers, allowing them to bring and open cans anywhere they wanted. Unfortunately, pull-tabs became an enormous littering problem almost immediately.

Why do we say 'Patience is a virtue'? Well-Known Expressions Patience is a virtue Meaning: To be able to wait for something without becoming frustrated is a valuable character trait. Background: 'Patience is a virtue' is a proverb, which is a short statement that expresses a culturally accepted truth. In this case, the phrase conveys the idea that accepting delayed gratification is a socially desirable trait. The idea that patience is a good trait to cultivate has been around for a very long time. Some of the earliest written references to the concept are in the Old Testament book of Proverbs, thought to have been compiled during the reign of Solomon (1015-975 BCE) but likely much older, based on oral tradition. Patience is also praised in the New Testament, the Qurâan, the Bhagavad Gita, the Tipitaka, and other religious scriptures created throughout the ages. Equating patience with virtue may hale back to the Latin text, Distichs of Cato. This collection of proverbs, written around the 2nd or 3rd century, was commonly used as a Latin primer through the 18th century. In it, the unnamed author writes, 'Of human virtues, patience is most great.' Geoffrey Chaucer relied heavily on this work for his Canterbury Tales (c.1400CE). In The Franklinâs Tale his narrator states, 'Pacience is an heigh vertu' (translating to 'patience is a high virtue' or 'patience is a conquering virtue'). Another work often credited with originating the phrase 'patience is a virtue' is Piers Plowman, written by English poet William Langland. The work, penned in 1360 CE, has the titular character, an exceptionally moral man, leading several individuals on a quest for moral enlightenment, and contains the line 'patience is a fair virtue.' Thomas Chalkley (1675-1741), a Quaker minister in Philadelphia, is believed to be the first American to use this phrase in his writing.

Why do we say 'Patience is a virtue'? Well-Known Expressions Patience is a virtue Meaning: To be able to wait for something without becoming frustrated is a valuable character trait. Background: 'Patience is a virtue' is a proverb, which is a short statement that expresses a culturally accepted truth. In this case, the phrase conveys the idea that accepting delayed gratification is a socially desirable trait. The idea that patience is a good trait to cultivate has been around for a very long time. Some of the earliest written references to the concept are in the Old Testament book of Proverbs, thought to have been compiled during the reign of Solomon (1015-975 BCE) but likely much older, based on oral tradition. Patience is also praised in the New Testament, the Qurâan, the Bhagavad Gita, the Tipitaka, and other religious scriptures created throughout the ages. Equating patience with virtue may hale back to the Latin text, Distichs of Cato. This collection of proverbs, written around the 2nd or 3rd century, was commonly used as a Latin primer through the 18th century. In it, the unnamed author writes, 'Of human virtues, patience is most great.' Geoffrey Chaucer relied heavily on this work for his Canterbury Tales (c.1400CE). In The Franklinâs Tale his narrator states, 'Pacience is an heigh vertu' (translating to 'patience is a high virtue' or 'patience is a conquering virtue'). Another work often credited with originating the phrase 'patience is a virtue' is Piers Plowman, written by English poet William Langland. The work, penned in 1360 CE, has the titular character, an exceptionally moral man, leading several individuals on a quest for moral enlightenment, and contains the line 'patience is a fair virtue.' Thomas Chalkley (1675-1741), a Quaker minister in Philadelphia, is believed to be the first American to use this phrase in his writing. "", ""https://www.mvtimes.com/2020/12/23/writing-heart-patience-virtue/\n\x1b[96m[1] Patience is a virtue, a phrase believed to have originated from the poem 'Piers Plowman,' written in 136O by English poet William Langland\x1b[0m. Willie should only know the trouble Iâve had with that particular virtue. One of the quips my son Dan repeated often to me that got a laugh but was said in all seriousness, was SLOW DOWN TURBO. Slow down, youâre rushing dinner. Slow down, youâre speeding in the car. Slow down, youâre speaking too fast.

Two years later, in 1824, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (which became the Royal SPCA in 1840) was established. The society focused especially on enforcement of the law, with prosecutions where appropriate. In 1835, the Act was amended to protect domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, against cruelty. \x1b[92m[0] The first American animal protection organization, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was established in 1866.\x1b[0m By 1900, several hundred other animal protection organizations had formed in America.

The economic contribution of agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining with the country's broad-based economic growth.

Measuring Acid Rain Acidity and alkalinity are measured using a pH scale for which 7.0 is neutral. The lower a substance's pH (less than 7), the more acidic it is; the higher a substance's pH (greater than 7), the more alkaline it is. Normal rain has a pH of about 5.6; it is slightly acidic because carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolves into it forming weak carbonic acid.  Acid rain usually has a pH between 4.2 and 4.4. Policymakers, research scientists, ecologists, and modelers rely on the National Atmospheric Deposition Programâs (NADP) National Trends Network (NTN) for measurements of wet deposition. The NADP/NTN collects acid rain at more than 250 monitoring sites throughout the US, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii and the US Virgin Islands. Unlike wet deposition, dry deposition is difficult and expensive to measure.

In 1996 and with the consent of Dylan, Scottish musician Ted Christopher wrote a new verse for 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' in memory of the schoolchildren and teacher killed in the Dunblane school massacre. This has been, according to some sources, one of the few times Dylan has officially authorized anybody to add or change the lyrics to one of his songs.This version of the song, including children from the village singing the chorus with guitarist and producer of Dylan's album Infidels (1983), Mark Knopfler, was released on December 9 in the UK and reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The proceeds went to charities for children.

The song also appears on many Dylan compilations, and from 1974 until 2003 it is estimated that Dylan performed this song in 460 different concerts (yes, there are people who count this stuff!). \x1b[92m[2] Now, here is Bob Dylan in a live performance of Knockinâ on Heavenâs Door.\x1b[0m ', ""https://timscoverstory.wordpress.com/2021/12/27/knockin-on-heavens-door-bob-dylan-eric-clapton-guns-n-roses/\nBelow is a photo of Bob Dylan.  This appeared on the cover of his eponymous first album, recorded at Columbia Recordsâ New York studios in November 1961. \x1b[92m[9] Bob Dylan wrote Knockinâ on Heavenâs Door for the 1973 movie Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\x1b[0m  The song appears in the scene where a frontier sheriff, played by Slim Pickens, is dying.  He refers to his wife, played by Katy Jurado, as 'Mama.' The version of this song that was used in the movie was specifically orchestrated for that film.  After the release of the movie, the song was re-recorded as a single record.  That version featured Roger McGuinn on guitar, Jim Keltner on drums, Booker T. Jones on bass, and Carl Fortina on harmonium. Bob Dylan was famous for songs with rather cryptic lyrics; however, Knockinâ on Heavenâs Door was an exercise in extreme simplicity. There are just two verses and a repetitive chorus. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockin%27_on_Heaven%27s_Door\n\x1b[92m[10] 'George Jackson' (1971) 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' (1973) 'A Fool Such as I' (1973) 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' is a song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, written for the soundtrack of the 1973 film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\x1b[0m Released as a single two months after the film's premiere, it became a worldwide hit, reaching the Top 10 in several countries. The song became one of Dylan's most popular and most covered post-1960s compositions, spawning covers from Eric Clapton, Guns N' Roses, Randy Crawford, and more. Described by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin as 'an exercise in splendid simplicity', the song features two short verses, the lyrics of which comment directly on the scene in the film for which it was written: the death of a frontier lawman (Slim Pickens) who refers to his wife (Katy Jurado) as 'Mama'. It was ranked number 190 in 2004 by Rolling Stone magazine, in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and number 192 in 2010.

At the time, it mainly became known for Bobâs hit, Knocking In Heavenâs Door.Amazingly, another tune (Wagon Wheel) was half recorded during this time but scrapped by Bob who can be heard mumbling the chorus on a bootleg recording. Later finished by Ketch Secor (2004) who wrote the verses, it became a huge hit in the hands of Nathan Carter (2012) and Darius Rucker (2013).

A lot of these ideas did not come through in the original release cut, the studio used some six editors to hack Peckinpahâs movie to pieces. But, Thankfully, Peckinpah had his original directorâs cut in his possession, which he kept hidden from the studio. That became the basis for the 115 minutes directorâs cut that was released on home video almost 3 decades later, and it resurrected much of the filmâs greatness. \x1b[92m[7] Anyway, despite the film being a box office flop on its release, Bob Dylanâs soundtrack was a superhit, with âKnockinâ on heavenâs Doorâ becoming a worldwide success.\x1b[0m Share this:TwitterFacebookPrintLinkedInRedditTumblrPinterestWhatsAppEmailLike Loading...

Britain had never given such a pledge to an eastern European country. There had never been a special relationship with Poland. Even Winston Churchill was amazed.'His Majesty's Government have given a guarantee to Poland. I was astounded when I heard them give this guarantee,' he told MPs in May 1939, when still a backbencher.So why did Britain do it? The answer of course, had less to do with Poland, and much more to do with Nazi Germany. In March 1939, Poland's southern neighbour Czechoslovakia fell apart. Adolf Hitler's German forces moved in, and Britain's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain decided that Germany could not be allowed to threaten another country. Few people remember that Britain didn't just offer support to Poland. It also pledged to help Greece and Romania, should either of those countries be attacked. Chamberlain called the assurances 'first aid treatment' - an admission that the pledges were made in a hurry, with no thought to how such promises might be honoured. Britain hoped that would be enough - it was not. Germany attacked and defeated Poland in a few weeks.

She is busily involved in village life and supports her children by taking on child-minding duties. Jill is an active member of the Women's Institute, opened up a holiday cottage business, and is teaching her grandson, Josh, how to keep bees. Jill has a less traditional outlook on life than her late husband, who had been a Justice of the Peace, reflected in her opposition to both foxhunting and private education. Following a burglary at Glebe Cottage she was asked by David and Ruth to return to Brookfield which subsequently became permanent.

By 1967, the songwriters were a respected duo in the music industry and were invited by producer Jerry Wexler to work in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, which was a recording hotspot in the 1960s and 70s.

Tarantino stated he probably wouldnât have used the scene if he wasnât allowed to use the song. Pulp Fictionâs soundtrack eventually sold over 2 million copies and a re-release of 'Son of a Preacher Man' reached number 1 in Iceland.In an interview with The Robesonian, Ronnie Wilkins thanked Quentin Tarantino for using the song. 'Iâm not sure he knew how much money that made for me,' he funnily remarked. 'I remember he called me up to ask about using it and then I more or less forgot about it. Later, I heard Siskel and Roper say the movie had a great soundtrack, and then I was blown away seeing how Quentin took it to a whole other level.'Dusty Springfield by Anefo â CC0The Legacy of Son of a Preacher ManOver the years, 'Son of a Preacher Man' became Dusty Springfieldâs signature song and one of the most well-known songs of the 1960s.

'I hated it because I couldnât be Aretha Franklin. I was someone who had come from thundering drums and Phil Spector, and I didnât understand sparseness. I wanted to fill every space. When I got free of that I finally liked it, but it took me a long timeâ¦ To this day I listen to Aretha Franklinâs phrasing and go, âGoddamit!â Thatâs the way I should have done it.'

After getting a satisfactory response, he steps into a cactus on his way out. The next episode has 'Homer Simpson' making the same impassioned plea to the Chief (while hanging from a flagpole). It ends with him dropping down crotch-first into a cactus. Homer tries to sue the producers, but the case is immediately dismissed. So, as a back-up plan, Homer decides to change his name. \x1b[92m[1] After reading through a list of ridiculous names Homer gave him, including 'Rembrandt Q. Einstein', 'Handsome B.

Disdaining permanent leaders, hierarchical relationships and parliamentary procedure, the founders conceived of the organization as a broad exercise in 'participatory democracy'.

The island is covered with more than 100 volcanoes. Some are extinct, but over 30 are still active. The majority of volcanism in Iceland occurs along volcanic rift zones that cut through the centre of the island. At constructive plate boundaries, also known as divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move away from one another to produce volcanoes. Hot magma rises from the mantle at mid-ocean ridges, pushing the plates apart. BGS Â© UKRI. Note: Iceland also sits above a mantle plume, or hot spot, where hot magma wells up from deep in the Earthâs mantle. The interaction of these two types of volcanism, over the last 15 million years or more, has created the island of Iceland.

Iceland, however, is also associated with a mantle plume (a narrow stem of upwelling of magma from deep in the mantle) that has maintained volcanism high and vigorous [1]. Spreading creates some sort of symmetry in the buildup of the island (although slightly distorted by the mantle plume) with the youngest rocks situated on the ridge and the older rocks away from the ridge on both sides (Figure 1). ', ""https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html\nThe volcanic country of Iceland, which straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, offers scientists a natural laboratory for studying on land the processes also occurring along the submerged parts of a spreading ridge.

Eruptions occur about every 5-10 years and primarily consist of basaltic lava and tephra. A few long-lived centres, such as the volcano Hekla, erupt more silicic magmas.

The peninsula consists of eight volcanically active sites, so understanding whether there is one shared magma source or multiple independent ones and their depth can help predict the duration and impact of these eruptions.Using geochemical and seismic data, the researchers investigated whether the magma of the initial eruptions from one volcano in the peninsula from 2021 to 2023 came from the same source as the magma in the recent eruptions of a different volcano to the west. Bindeman specializes in isotopic analysis, which can help identify the 'fingerprint' of magma. (See Focus on Equipment and Methodology below.)

Because its history has always been closely related to volcanism, many volcanic eruptions since the middle ages have been recorded and preserved. Iceland was settled in 834 AD, established its own parliament in 930 AD and recorded its first historical volcanic eruption ~934 AD, during which Eldagia, the longest volcanic fissure in the world, was created. Due to the amount of volcanic activity â averaging one every three years â and the resulting devastation to the country of Iceland from lava, ash and sometimes years of famine, there is a well documented record of Icelandic volcanic eruptions.

This is done to take advantage of the wider angle that can be reflected by a Convex mirror. A convex mirror, also known as diverging mirror, is one which bulges at the middle and is thinner at the edges. While this captures a wider object field, it does so at the cost of image accuracy. The result is compression of the reflected image, which makes objects appear smaller and farther away than they really are. The warning is mentioned in the mirrors so that the driver can accordingly make adjustments and take a well calculated decision.

The carbohydrate molecules are obtained from the carbon dioxide from the use of chemical energy gathered during the reactions. The Light energy tends to split into the water and later extracts the electrons from the photosystem II; then the electrons move from the PSII to b6f (cytochrome) to the photosystem I (PSI) and reduce in the form of energy. ', 'https://www.albert.io/blog/photosynthesis-and-cellular-respiration-ap-biology-crash-course/\nThe process of photosynthesis is an essential APÂ® Biology concept to understand.  Photosynthesis is the means by which most of the plant life on Earth gets its energy.  All animals receive nutrients either from plants or from animals that get their energy from plants.  This means that plants are the basis for all of the ecosystems on Earth, making photosynthesis a very important process.  So, in order to understand how photosynthesis happens, biologists have to break it down into two parts, the light and dark reactions. 1. \x1b[92m[5] Light Reaction (or the Light-Dependent Reactions) This is the first step in the process of photosynthesis.\x1b[0m  \x1b[92m[6] The light reaction is the process by which the leaf of a plant will absorb energy from the sun (in the form of photons) and will transfer it into electron carriers and energy (in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP).\x1b[0m ', ""https://byjus.com/biology/light-dependent-reactions/\n\x1b[92m[1] 'Light reaction is the process of photosynthesis that converts energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP.'\x1b[0m What is Light Reaction? The light reaction is also known as photolysis reaction and takes place in the presence of light. It usually takes place in the grana of chloroplasts. The photosystems have pigment molecules. \x1b[92m[7] In the plants, chlorophyll is one of the primary pigments which actively takes part in the process of light reactions like photosynthesis.\x1b[0m The accessory pigments include carotenoids. The energy from the sun is absorbed by the chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts. The energy is then transferred to ATP and NADPH that is generated by two-electron transport chains. Water is used and oxygen is released during the process. Let us have an overview of light reaction and the mechanism involved in light reaction. Also Read: Cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation Process of Light Reaction "", ""https://omexcanada.com/blog/manganese-in-water-splitting-photosynthesis/\nFigure 2. \x1b[92m[9] Light energy is absorbed by a chlorophyll molecule and is passed along a pathway to other chlorophyll molecules.\x1b[0m The energy culminates in a molecule of chlorophyll found in the reaction center. The energy 'excites' one of its electrons enough to leave the molecule and be transferred to a nearby primary electron acceptor. A molecule of water splits to release an electron, which is needed to replace the one donated. Oxygen and hydrogen ions are also formed from the splitting of water. Source: https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-2-the-light-dependent-reactions-of-photosynthesis/ For more information, watch the narrated Youtube video: "", ""https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-1-overview-of-photosynthesis/\nPhotosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. \x1b[92m[2] In the light-dependent reactions, which take place at the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy with the use of water.\x1b[0m The light-dependent reactions release oxygen from the hydrolysis of water as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules. The two reactions use carrier molecules to transport the energy from one to the other. The carriers that move energy from the light-dependent reactions to the Calvin cycle reactions can be thought of as 'full' because they bring energy. After the energy is released, the 'empty' energy carriers return to the light-dependent reactions to obtain more energy. Section Summary "", ""https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-wmopen-biology1/chapter/photosynthesis/\n\x1b[92m[8] Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light.\x1b[0m Organic pigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. Energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state. Energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. So retinal pigments can only 'see' (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. For the same reasons, plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation. "", 'https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-wmopen-biology1/chapter/photosynthesis/\n\x1b[92m[4] The pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight.\x1b[0m A photon strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. The energy travels to the reaction center that contains chlorophyll a to the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior. This action builds up a high concentration of ions. The ions flow through ATP synthase via chemiosmosis to form molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy and reducing power carrier for the light-independent reactions.

Why do golfers shout fore? The RulesThe more modern-day Rules of Golf cover the need to shout âfore' as early as Section 1.2a: Conduct Expected of All Players. This states that players are expected to play in the spirit of the game by 'showing consideration to others.'For example, by playing at a prompt pace, looking out for the safety of others, and not distracting the play of another player. \x1b[92m[2] If a player plays a ball in a direction where there might be a danger of hitting someone, they should immediately shout a warning, such as the traditional\x1b[0m warning of 'fore'.However, it also states that 'there is no penalty under the Rules for failing to act in this way, except that the Committee may disqualify a player for acting contrary to the spirit of the game if it finds that the player has committed serious misconduct.'And herein lies a problem, you could say.

It was proven to be too much for Fanfiction.net, a site for fans to write stories based on the art they love, and James took her stories down.

After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote Master of the Universe as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, and removed it from her website before publication.

In its initial iteration, E.L. \x1b[92m[6] Jamesâ 50 Shades of Gray was known as Master of the Universe, written by James using the online handle Snowqueenâs Icedragon, as a fan fiction version of Stephenie Meyersâ Twilight saga â with the lead male figure transformed from a 114 year old vampire into an all-too human billionaire.\x1b[0m (Fan fiction, for those not familiar with it, are stories written by fans of the original story, using various story lines, characters and settings, often with large amounts of sex thrown into the mix.) As Downes writes, 'Many write unique pieces only sharing the most basic elements, while others lift whole sections of the source material in order to create their own works. This is called, in copyright, âderivative works,â and renders these pieces as the property of the original creative force.' This also means, according to Downes, that it is Meyers who has the power to give her approval (or not) for these works.

(March 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this message) \x1b[92m[1] The origin of the phrase 'cold turkey' in the sense of unpleasant withdrawal is a matter of some debate and ambiguity\x1b[0m. Reaction to being served cheap meat "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_turkey\nThe hypothesis posited by researchers[who?] is that Hume's behavior towards Clara - excluding and excommunicating her in retaliation for her ongoing ill-treatment of him - became known as 'the cold turkey treatment', and that word quickly spread from London to the rest of Britain, and finally the United States. \x1b[96m[2] An early print appearance of 'cold turkey' in its exclusionary sense dates to 1910, in Canadian poet Robert W. Service's The Trail of '98: A Northland Romance\x1b[0m: 'Once I used to gamble an' drink the limit. One morning I got up from the card-table after sitting there thirty-six hours. I'd lost five thousand dollars. I knew they'd handed me out 'cold turkey'...' 'Talking turkey' Another possible origin relates to the American phrase talk turkey, meaning 'to speak bluntly with little preparation'. The phrase 'taking cold turkey' has also been reported during the 1920s as slang for pleading guilty. Goosebumps "", ""https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/why-do-we-quit-cold-turkey\nThe problem with both of these theories is that they ignore the uses of cold turkey before its application to drug addiction. In a cartoon that appeared in newspapers on November 12, 1920, ace slangman Thomas 'TAD' Dorgan used cold turkey this way â 'Now tell me on the square â can I get by with this for the wedding â don't string me â tell me cold turkey.' The editors of the Historical Dictionary of American Slang have found an earlier use: a 1910 usage where the speaker lost $5,000 cold turkey, in the sense of losing it outright. \x1b[95m[3] It may be that the original cold turkey was a combination of cold ('straightforward, matter-of-fact') and the earlier talk turkey, which dates back to the early 1800s and refers to speaking plainly\x1b[0m.

', ""https://www.lyricslayers.com/billie-holiday/175917/\nBillie Holiday's 'God Bless The Child' is a poignant song that delves into themes of self-reliance and the harsh realities of economic disparity. The lyrics reflect a conversation about the importance of having one's own means in a world where wealth and social status can dictate one's opportunities and friendships. The opening lines, 'Them that's got shall have / Them that's not shall lose,' echo the biblical sentiment of the rich getting richer while the poor get poorer, a commentary on the unforgiving nature of society's distribution of wealth.The song further explores the fickle nature of relationships based on financial status. Holiday sings about how money attracts many friends, but these relationships are often superficial and disappear once the wealth is gone. This is a stark reminder of the value of genuine connections that are not influenced by material possessions. \x1b[92m[1] The repeated lines, 'Mama may have, Papa may have / But God bless the child that's got his own,' serve as a powerful refrain, emphasizing the blessing and strength found in self-sufficiency and not relying on others for one's well-being.Billie Holiday's performance of the song, with her emotive and soulful voice, adds depth to the message, making it resonate with listeners across generations.\x1b[0m The song is not just a reflection on economic inequality but also an anthem of empowerment, encouraging individuals to strive for personal independence and to take control of their own destiny, regardless of their circumstances.

He was awarded Scouting's Silver Beaver Award for Distinguished Service.President Joe Biden joined the Boy Scout program in his teens as an Explorer Scout. Four U.S. presidents were Cub Scouts in their youth, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. Barack Obama was a Siaga, the equivalent of a Cub Scout in the national Scouting organization of Indonesia.Gerald Ford continued to support Scouting though the years. In 1970 he received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, and in 1995. the Silver Buffalo Award. When Ford died in 2006, 400 Eagle Scouts took part in his funeral, some as an honor guard, others as ushers.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-upÂ© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...

344,"['https://byjus.com/chemistry/precipitation-reaction/\nMany chemical reactions occur in our daily lives. Common examples of such reactions are burning, corrosion, cooking of food and digestion. One important class of chemical reactions are precipitation reactions. In such reactions, two different soluble salts (which are in aqueous solutions) combine to form two products. \x1b[92m[7] One of these products is insoluble in the solution and is precipitated out (and is, therefore, referred to as the âprecipitateâ).\x1b[0m Precipitation Reaction â Definition and Meaning ', 'https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Main_Group_Reactions/Reactions_in_Aqueous_Solutions/Precipitation_Reactions\n\x1b[92m[4] Precipitates are insoluble ionic solid products of a reaction, formed when certain cations and anions combine in an aqueous solution.\x1b[0m The determining factors of the formation of a precipitate can vary. Some reactions depend on temperature, such as solutions used for buffers, whereas others are dependent only on solution concentration. The solids produced in precipitate reactions are crystalline solids, and can be suspended throughout the liquid or fall to the bottom of the solution. The remaining fluid is called supernatant liquid. The two components of the mixture (precipitate and supernate) can be separated by various methods, such as filtration, centrifuging, or decanting. Figure 1: Above is a diagram of the formation of a precipitate in solution. Precipitation and Double Replacement Reactions ', 'https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/igcse/chemistry/how-do-precipitate-formations-indicate-chemical-changes\n\x1b[92m[3] ArticleHow do precipitate formations indicate chemical changes?Precipitate formations indicate chemical changes by showing that a new substance has been created in a reaction.In chemistry, a precipitate is a solid that forms in a solution during a chemical reaction.\x1b[0m This process is known as precipitation. When two solutions are mixed together, if a chemical reaction occurs, it often results in the formation of a new substance. This new substance can be a gas, a different solution, or a solid. \x1b[92m[10] When a solid is formed, it is called a precipitate.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[8] The formation of a precipitate is a clear sign that a chemical change has taken place.The formation of a precipitate is a result of a specific type of chemical reaction called a precipitation reaction.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] In a precipitation reaction, two soluble reactants combine to form an insoluble product, the precipitate.\x1b[0m This precipitate will often settle at the bottom of the reaction vessel or float to the top, depending on its density relative to the solution. For example, if you mix solutions of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl), a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) forms. The equation for this reaction is AgNO3 + NaCl â AgCl + NaNO3. The silver chloride is the precipitate, and its formation indicates that a chemical change has occurred.Precipitation reactions are important in many areas of chemistry, including analytical chemistry, where they are used to identify the presence of certain ions in a solution. By observing the formation of a precipitate, chemists can infer that a chemical reaction has taken place, and use this information to identify the substances involved in the reaction.In conclusion, the formation of a precipitate is a clear visual indicator of a chemical change. It shows that a new substance has been created as a result of a chemical reaction, providing evidence of a chemical change.Answered by Till - University of Cambridge: Masterâs in Chemical Engineering ', 'https://www.vaia.com/en-us/textbooks/chemistry/chemistry-matter-and-change-2007-edition/chapter-9/problem-78-under-what-conditions-does-a-precipitate-form-in-/\n\x1b[92m[0] A precipitate forms in a chemical reaction when an insoluble solid is produced due to the interaction between two or more soluble reactants.\x1b[0m This occurs when a double displacement reaction takes place and at least one insoluble product is formed according to the solubility rules. Factors like temperature, concentration, and pressure can also affect precipitation. Step by step solution 01 Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction Write down a balanced chemical equation involving the reactants provided in the problem. 02 Determine the solubility of the reactants and products Consult a solubility chart to determine which of the reactants and products are soluble or insoluble in water. 03 Identify if a double displacement reaction occurs Analyze the chemical equation to see if a double displacement reaction takes place, in which the ions from two different compounds exchange places, potentially forming a precipitate. 04 Apply the solubility rules ', 'https://www.toppr.com/guides/chemistry/solutions/precipitation-reaction-definition-and-examples/\n\x1b[92m[5] A precipitation reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs in aqueous solution and form precipitates.\x1b[0m Further, chemical reactions consist of chemical changes that take place within the substances. Thus, it gives rise to a new element under some particular conditions. Moreover, chemical reactions occur between two or more chemical compounds that we refer to as reactants. Thus, the reactants can be in forms of solid, gas or liquid. What is Precipitation Reaction? It means the chemical reaction occurs in aqueous solutions where two ions bond together to form insoluble salts. These insoluble salts formed are precipitates that are the products of it. They can be single displacement reactions or double displacement reactions. In a double displacement reaction, both ionic reactants dissociate in water and their ions bonds with the respective cation or anion from the other reactant. ', 'https://byjus.com/chemistry/precipitation-reaction/\nThe formation of a precipitate also suggests the presence of a chemical reaction. When a silver nitrate solution is poured into a sodium chloride solution, a chemical reaction occurs, producing a white silver chloride precipitate. Q3 What is an example of formation of precipitate? When a silver nitrate solution is poured into a sodium chloride solution, a chemical reaction occurs, producing a white silver chloride precipitate. A yellow lead(II) iodide precipitate is formed when the potassium iodide solution reacts with the lead(II) nitrate solution. Q4 Is Salt a precipitate? \x1b[92m[2] The insoluble salt falling out of the solution is referred to as the precipitate, hence the name of the reaction.\x1b[0m Precipitation reactions in the solution can help determine the identity of different ions. Q5 What factors affect precipitation? ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)\n\x1b[92m[9] In an aqueous solution, precipitation is the 'sedimentation of a solid material (a precipitate) from a liquid solution'.\x1b[0m The solid formed is called the precipitate. In case of an inorganic chemical reaction leading to precipitation, the chemical reagent causing the solid to form is called the precipitant. The clear liquid remaining above the precipitated or the centrifuged solid phase is also called the supernate or supernatant. The notion of precipitation can also be extended to other domains of chemistry (organic chemistry and biochemistry) and even be applied to the solid phases (e.g. metallurgy and alloys) when solid impurities segregate from a solid phase. Supersaturation Main article: Supersaturation The precipitation of a compound may occur when its concentration exceeds its solubility. This can be due to temperature changes, solvent evaporation, or by mixing solvents. Precipitation occurs more rapidly from a strongly supersaturated solution. "", ""https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/backgrounders/evidence-chemical-change\nIn some chemical reactions, the gas produced can be highly toxic. This can happen at home if certain cleaning products are mixed together. Breathing the gas created from mixing some cleaning products can even result in death. This is why you should never use two different cleaning products together - ever! \x1b[92m[6] Precipitate Formation Sometimes when two solutions undergo a chemical reaction, one of the new products formed from the reaction is not soluble.\x1b[0m This means that it is not able to dissolve in the new solution. Instead, we can observe a solid that is distinct and separate from the solution. We call this solid a precipitate. You have probably heard the word 'precipitation', but maybe not when talking about chemistry. We also use the word precipitation to refer to the types of water that fall from the sky. The solid in a precipitation reaction also often falls, or sinks, to the bottom of the solution. Precipitation reactions are all double replacement reactions.

In post-Revolutionary America, such freedom gradually reduced due to religious sentiments (as embodied in the temperance movement) and a growing recognition in the medical community about the dangers of alcohol. The more modern history is given in the table below. Unless otherwise noted, if different alcohol categories have different minimum purchase ages, the age listed below is set at the lowest age given (e.g. if the purchase age is 18 for beer and 21 for wine or spirits, as was the case in several states, the age in the table will read as '18', not '21'). In addition, the purchase age is not necessarily the same as the minimum age for consumption of alcoholic beverages, although they have often been the same. As one can see in the table below, there has been much volatility in the states' purchase ages since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. Shortly after the ratification of the 21st amendment in December, most states set their purchase ages at 21 since that was the voting age at the time. Most of these limits remained constant until the early 1970s. From 1969 to 1976, some 30 states lowered their purchase ages, generally to 18. This was primarily because the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1971 with the passing into law of the 26th amendment. Many states started to lower their minimum purchase age in response, most of this occurring in 1972 or 1973. Twelve states kept their purchase ages at 21 since repeal of Prohibition and never changed them.

This post outlines a four-step process, emphasizing taking notes in class, summarizing, and reviewing notes for optimal understanding.The Cornell format includes a header section, a summary section, a main notetaking section, and a cue section.  Weâve provided some practical tips, such as using short sentences, abbreviations, and symbols for efficient notetaking. The method's benefits include focused learning, easy notetaking, clear and structured notes, and enhanced skimming ability.However, there are some drawbacks, such as the challenge of paraphrasing in real-time and the necessity of working within the method's structured framework. It is recommended that when using the Cornell Method of notetaking you complete the cue and summary sections soon after lectures to maximize recall benefits. Overall, the Cornell Method proves beneficial for lectures, independent study, and group sessions, offering a clear structure for effective learning and retention.

The function of a reverse proxy can be performed by a device, software, or service depending on the complexity of the environment and needs of the organization. Cloud-native environments \x1b[92m[4] Ideal for cloud-native environments, NGINX Plus is a software-based reverse proxy that performs load balancing, Layer 7 routing and web performance optimization\x1b[0m, similar to a hardware device. NGINX Plus also helps improve website performance, reliability, security, and scale. NGINX Plus is much less expensive than hardware-based solutions with similar capabilities.

Limitations of NGINX Although NGINX has lots of benefits, there are some limitations, too. It has a low level of community support and contributions from developers, leading to fewer features and updates. Both maintenance and setup require expert knowledge. Although NGINX is free to use, it also has a paid version called NGINX Plus, an all-in-one load balancer, content cache, web server, API gateway, and microservices proxy that costs $2,500 per year. \x1b[92m[5] Use Cases An instance of NGINX can be configured as any of the following: A web server. This is the most common because of its performance and scalability.\x1b[0mA reverse proxy server. NGINX does this by directing the client's request to the appropriate back-end server.A load balancer.

Consider splitting content into sub-articles, condensing it, or adding subheadings. Please discuss this issue on the article's talk page. \x1b[92m[1] (November 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this message) In the Germanic languages, a strong verb is a verb that marks its past tense by means of changes to the stem vowel.\x1b[0m The majority of the remaining verbs form the past tense by means of a dental suffix, are known as weak verbs, and outnumber strong verbs. "", 'https://blogs.transparent.com/german/weak-verbs-in-german/\nWeak Verbs in German Posted by Sandra RÃ¶sner on May 7, 2012 in Language In German, there are two basic forms of verbs: weak verbs and strong verbs. Weak verbs or regular verbs are those that follow a set pattern of rules and retain the same stem vowel throughout. These verbs are called weak verbs because you might think of them as being simply too weak to alter the patterns they follow â when they are conjugated. \x1b[92m[0] Strong verbs, on the other hand, do not follow a set pattern of conjugation, that is, the stem vowel will change when you, for example, form the past form of a strong verb.\x1b[0m When you are a native speaker of English you have already come across strong and weak verbs in your mother language. As mentioned above, German weak verbs are nothing else than English regular verbs (e.g. walk-walked-walked), and German strong verbs are nothing else than English irregular verbs (go-went-gone), so to speak. ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_strong_verb\nAs well as developing the strong verb system, Germanic also went on to develop two other classes of verbs: the weak verbs and a third, much smaller, class known as the preterite-present verbs, which are continued in the English auxiliary verbs, e.g. can/could, shall/should, may/might, must. Weak verbs originally derived from other types of word in PIE and originally occurred only in the present aspect. They did not have a perfect aspect, meaning that they came to lack a past tense in Germanic once the perfect had become the past[clarification needed]. Not having a past tense at all, they obviously also had no vowel alternations between present and past. To compensate for this, a new type of past tense was eventually created for these verbs by adding a -d- or -t- suffix to the stem. \x1b[92m[2] This is why only strong verbs have vowel alternations: their past tense forms descend from the original PIE perfect aspect, while the past tense forms of weak verbs were created later.\x1b[0m ']",how many strong verbs are there in german,"In the German language, there are approximately 200 strong verbs.

For him, historia was 'the knowledge of objects determined by space and time', that sort of knowledge provided by memory (while science was provided by reason, and poetry was provided by fantasy).

', ""https://veteransbreakfastclub.org/the-yellow-ribbon-a-twisted-history/\nVintage Desert Storm lapel pin In 1971, Pete Hamill crafted a new version of it for the New York Post. In it, he substituted a yellow handkerchief for the white ribbon and an oak tree for the apple tree. Readerâs Digest reprinted Hamillâs story in 1972, and ABC-TV rushed out a feature starring James Earl Jones as the ex-con. \x1b[92m[1] The following year, Tony Orlando and Dawn released a smash hit with 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree.'\x1b[0m Itâs hard to exaggerate just how popular this song was. Radio stations played it several times a day, every day, for months. It topped the charts in eight countries. And it hit with multiple generations, not just youth. I distinctly remember older aunts and uncles singing it when I was kid. Pete Hamill sued the songwriters, Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown, for copyright infringement. To no avail. The story wasnât Hamillâs. It belonged to our collective folkloric imagination. "", ""https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2003/04/20/don-t-tie-a-yellow-ribbon-round-the-ole-oak-tree/\nBeyond that, don't forget that this tradition was born not from some heroic folk tale about the teenage bride of a Civil War soldier wearing a yellow ribbon while counting the days until her man's return. \x1b[92m[4] It stems from one of the worst pop songs ever: Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree by Dawn featuring Tony Orlando, which topped the pop charts exactly 30 years ago this month.\x1b[0m According to the Folklife Reading Room of the Library of Congress, even though the song was released in 1973, the yellow ribbon routine didn't surface until 1980, when 52 Americans were held hostage in Iran. In the John Wayne film She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), a woman sported yellow to express her devotion to a cavalry officer. But there's no record of yellow ribbons appearing during the Korean War, the Vietnam War or any other conflict pre-1980. "", ""https://www.albertleatribune.com/2013/12/how-to-tell-a-trumpeter-swan-from-a-tundra-swan/\n\x1b[92m[0] 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree' is a song by Tony Orlando and Dawn that was a worldwide hit in 1973.\x1b[0m The song was about a prisoner who had completed his sentence, but was uncertain if heâd be welcomed home. He wrote his love, asking her to tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree in front of the house if she wanted him back. He asked the bus driver to look, as he feared there would be no ribbon. Bus passengers cheered after seeing 100 yellow ribbons tied around the tree. A woman told me that sheâd tied a yellow ribbon around an old oak tree in her yard in the 1970s. A squirrel swiped the ribbon and tied it around an old squirrel nest. Chickadee chat Research showed that a chickadeeâs brain grows up to 30 percent larger during times when they need to find food for caching. The brain expands, adding new nerve cells to help it remember where it had stored food. In the spring, when memory is less important, the brain shrinks to normal size. "", ""https://bigdave44.com/2024/01/11/ev-1623-setters-blog/\nThe symbol became widely known in civilian life in the 1970s. \x1b[92m[3] It was the central theme of the popular song 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree', Written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown and recorded by Tony Orlando and Dawn (among many others), as the sign a released prisoner requested from his wife or lover to indicate that she would welcome him home.\x1b[0m[4] He would be able to see it from the bus driving by their house and would stay on the bus in the absence of the ribbon. He turned out to be very welcome: There were a hundred yellow ribbons. From the Library of Congress: In October 1971, newspaper columnist Pete Hamill wrote a piece for the New York Post called 'Going Home.' In it, college students on a bus trip to the beaches of Fort Lauderdale make friends with an ex-convict who is watching for a yellow handkerchief on a roadside oak.

411,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fool_on_the_Hill\n'The Fool on the Hill' is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 EP and album Magical Mystery Tour. It was written and sung by Paul McCartney and credited to the LennonâMcCartney partnership. \x1b[92m[1] The lyrics describe the titular 'fool', a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise\x1b[0m. McCartney said the idea for the song was inspired by the Dutch design collective the Fool, who derived their name from the tarot card of the same name, and possibly by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The song's segment in the Magical Mystery Tour television film was shot separately from the rest of the film and without the other Beatles' knowledge. Accompanied by a professional cameraman, McCartney filmed the scene near Nice in France. In 1968, SÃ©rgio Mendes & Brasil '66 recorded a cover version of the song that reached the top ten in the US. By the late 1970s, 'The Fool on the Hill' was one of McCartney's most widely recorded ballads. A solo demo and an outtake of the song were included on the Beatles' 1996 compilation album Anthology 2. Background and lyrics The song's lyrics describe the titular 'fool', a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise. In his authorised biography, Many Years from Now, Paul McCartney \x1b[92m[2] says he first got the idea for the premise from the Dutch design collective the Fool, who were the Beatles' favourite designers in 1967 and told him that they had derived their name from the Tarot card of the same name\x1b[0m. According to McCartney, \x1b[92m[3] the song possibly relates to a character such as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Beatles' meditation teacher: 'Fool on the Hill' was mine and I think I was writing about someone like Maharishi\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] His detractors called him a fool\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Because of his giggle, he wasn't taken too seriously\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] It was this idea of a fool on the hill, a guru in a cave, I was attracted to\x1b[0m ... I was sitting at the piano at my father's house in Liverpool hitting a D 6th chord, and I made up 'Fool on the Hill'. Alistair Taylor, in his book Yesterday, reports a mysterious incident involving a man who inexplicably appeared near him and McCartney during a walk on Primrose Hill and then disappeared again, soon after McCartney and Taylor had conversed about the existence of God. In Taylor's account, this incident prompted McCartney to write 'The Fool on the Hill'.

C3 : C4 photosynthesis research "", ""Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. In the light-dependent reactions, which take place at the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy with the use of water. The light-dependent reactions release oxygen from the hydrolysis of water as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules. The two reactions use carrier molecules to transport the energy from one to the other. The carriers that move energy from the light-dependent reactions to the Calvin cycle reactions can be thought of as 'full' because they bring energy. After the energy is released, the 'empty' energy carriers return to the light-dependent reactions to obtain more energy.

C3 : C4 photosynthesis research "", ""https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-1-overview-of-photosynthesis/\nPhotosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. In the light-dependent reactions, which take place at the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy with the use of water. The light-dependent reactions release oxygen from the hydrolysis of water as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules. The two reactions use carrier molecules to transport the energy from one to the other. The carriers that move energy from the light-dependent reactions to the Calvin cycle reactions can be thought of as 'full' because they bring energy. After the energy is released, the 'empty' energy carriers return to the light-dependent reactions to obtain more energy.

', 'https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Biology/Human_Biology_(Wakim_and_Grewal)/13%3A_Integumentary_System/13.3%3A_Skin\nOnly on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, the next layer above the stratum granulosum is the stratum lucidum. This is a layer consisting of stacks of translucent, dead keratinocytes that provide extra protection to the underlying layers. Stratum Corneum The uppermost layer of the epidermis everywhere on the body is the stratum corneum. \x1b[92m[2] This layer is made of flat, hard, tightly packed dead keratinocytes that form a waterproof keratin barrier to protect the underlying layers of the epidermis.\x1b[0m Dead cells from this layer are constantly shed from the surface of the body. The shed cells are continually replaced by cells moving up from the lower layers of the epidermis. It takes a period of about 48 days for newly formed keratinocytes in the stratum basale to make their way to the top of the stratum corneum to replace shed cells. Functions of the Epidermis ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin\nThe epidermis contains no blood vessels, and cells in the deepest layers are nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air and to a far lesser degree by blood capillaries extending to the outer layers of the dermis. The main type of cells that make up the epidermis are Merkel cells, keratinocytes, with melanocytes and Langerhans cells also present. The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, and basale. Cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer. The daughter cells (see cell division) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off (desquamation). This process is called 'keratinization'. \x1b[92m[3] This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and pathogens out, making skin a natural barrier to infection.\x1b[0m "", 'https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Biology/Human_Biology_(Wakim_and_Grewal)/13%3A_Integumentary_System/13.3%3A_Skin\nThe epidermis is the outer of the two main layers of the skin, the inner layer being the dermis. It averages about 0.10 mm thick and is much thinner than the dermis. The epidermis is thinnest on the eyelids (0.05 mm) and thickest on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (1.50 mm). The epidermis covers almost the entire body surface. It is continuous with, but structurally distinct from, the mucous membranes that line the mouth, anus, urethra, and vagina. \x1b[92m[0] Structure of the Epidermis There are no blood vessels and very few nerve cells in the epidermis.\x1b[0m Without blood to bring epidermal cells oxygen and nutrients, the cells must absorb oxygen directly from the air and obtain nutrients via diffusion of fluids from the dermis below. However, as thin as it is, the epidermis still has a complex structure. It has a variety of cell types and multiple layers.

However, this correction is excessive and the Gregorian reform modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are. 1800 calendar, showing that February had only 28 days "", ""https://www.infoplease.com/calendars/months-seasons/leap-year-explained\nThe Gregorian calendar, which now serves as the standard calendar for civil use throughout the world, has both common years and leap years. A common year has 365 days and a leap year 366 days, with the extraâ or intercalaryâ day designated as February 29. \x1b[92m[0] A leap year occurs every four years to help synchronize the calendar year with the solar year, or the length of time it takes to complete the Earth's orbit around the sun, which is about 365 days and a quarter of a day.\x1b[0m The length of the solar year, however, is slightly less than 365Â¼ days-by about 11 minutes. To compensate for this discrepancy, the leap year is omitted three times every four hundred years. In other words, a century year cannot be a leap year unless it is divisible by 400. Thus 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years. When Are Leap Years? "", ""https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/leap-year-explained\nThat surplus of 0.24 days might seem insignificant, but let it accumulate for a few centuries, and weâd find ourselves seriously out of sync with the seasons. 'Leap years, therefore, are essential to prevent this drift and maintain the alignment of our calendar with the Earth's journey around the Sun,' Kim says. \x1b[92m[1] undefined As 0.24 is approximately a quarter of a day, we add four of them together on 29 February in a leap year to keep in step.\x1b[0m Who invented leap years? This system of adding one day every four years was introduced by none other than the ancient leader of Rome, Julius Caesar, in the year 46 BC. Prior to this appropriately named Julian calendar, the Roman Empire had operated using a calendar with 355 days in a year. Instead of adding the occasional extra day, back then it was the job of the high priests in Rome to call a leap month whenever they felt things were getting out of phase.

Its range is confined to cold, boreal waters of the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. It is common in the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea, and in western Scandinavian waters south to Kattegat and Ãresund. It may also drift into the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea (where it cannot breed due to the low salinity). Similar jellyfish â which may be the same species â are known to inhabit seas near Australia and New Zealand.

As the Sea reached salt levels similar to the ocean many ocean species were stocked into the Sea as well.

', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III\nGriffin was widely projected to be the No. 2 pick of the draft, but the St. Louis Ramsâthe team originally holding the pickâhad already selected Sam Bradford to be their long-term starting quarterback with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 NFL draft. Wanting to stick with Bradford, the Rams decided to deal the pick prior to the draft, with the Cleveland Browns and Washington Redskins perceived as the most interested bidders. After a brief bidding process, the Redskins acquired the pick by giving the Rams four high-value draft picks over three years: their first-round picks in 2012 (No.6 overall), 2013 (No.22 overall), and 2014 (No.2 overall), as well as their second-round pick (No.39 overall) in 2012. Washington Redskins 2012 season Griffin during Redskins training camp in 2012 As expected, the Redskins selected Griffin as the second overall pick, making him the second Baylor Bear to be drafted that high in four years (after Jason Smith in 2009), but the first Baylor quarterback to be chosen second overall since Adrian Burk in 1950. Griffin wore number 10 for the Redskins, with 'Griffin III' on the back of his jersey. This made him the first player in the history of the 'Big Four' professional sports leagues (NFL, MLB, NHL, and NBA) to have a Roman numeral on the back of his jersey, as the NFL changed the rule in 2012 to allow players to include generational titles in their names. Griffin previously had 'Griffin III' on the back of his jersey while in college, which was actually necessary in order to distinguish him from the other Robert Griffin on the Baylor team. On July 18, 2012, the Redskins officially signed him to a four-year, $21.1 million contract with a $13.8 million signing bonus.

298,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin\nViolins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it. Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed. Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial 'trade violins' coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker. Etymology The word 'violin' was first used in English in the 1570s.

Throughout the $2 bill's pre-1929 life as a large-sized note, it was issued as a United States Note, a National Bank Note, a Silver Certificate, a Treasury or 'Coin' Note, and a Federal Reserve Bank Note. When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, in 1928, the $2 bill was redesigned and issued only as a United States Note. Production continued until 1966 (1967), when United States Notes were phased out; the $2 denomination was discontinued until 1976, when it was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note, with a new reverse. "", ""Authorized under an act by the United States Congress, the first two-dollar bill was issued in March 1862 and the denomination was continuously used until 1966; by that time, the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency to which the two-dollar bill was assigned. In August 1966, the Treasury Department discontinued production of the $2 and $5 denominations of United States Notes. While the $5 denomination had been issued simultaneously as a Federal Reserve Note, a United States Note and a Silver Certificate, the $2 denomination was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency, thus was fully discontinued. The Treasury cited low usage of the two-dollar bill as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination. Production of the two-dollar denomination was resumed in December, 1975, and the two-dollar bill was finally reissued in the spring of 1976 as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence, replacing the previous design of Monticello. The two-dollar note has remained a current denomination of U.S. currency since that time. As estimated at the time, if two-dollar notes replaced about half of the one-dollar notes in circulation, the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ($139 million adjusted for inflation) over the period from 1976 to 1981, due to reduced production, storage, and shipping costs.

Paul soundly condemns anyone who would denigrate the grace of God and attempt to change the gospel (Galatians 1:8â10). \x1b[92m[2] He gives his apostolic credentials (Galatians 1:11â2:14) and emphasizes that righteousness comes through Christ not the works of the Law (Galatians 2:21).\x1b[0m The Galatians must stand fast in their freedom and not be 'entangled again with a yoke of bondage (that is, the Mosaic law)' (Galatians 5:1). Christian freedom is not an excuse to gratify one's sin nature; rather, our freedom is an opportunity to love one another (Galatians 5:13; 6:7â10).

322,"[""https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/elections/types-of-elections.html\nIn presidential elections, each major political party holds a national convention where they choose their nominee for president. The results of the primary election determine how votes from Pennsylvania are cast at the convention. The nominees from each party run against each other in the general election in November. \x1b[92m[1] The president is officially elected by the Electoral College, not by popular vote.\x1b[0m But the popular vote â including your vote â helps determine which candidate receives Pennsylvania's electoral votes. About the Electoral College The U.S. Constitution created the Electoral College to ensure that each state has a role in selecting the president, no matter its population. Each state has the same number of electoral votes as it has members of Congress. There are a total of 538 votes in the Electoral College. A candidate must win a simple majority--270 electoral votes-- to win the election. "", ""https://votesmart.org/education/elections\nc.

Office-Block Ballot "", 'https://ourwhitehouse.org/getting-the-votes-and-getting-elected-the-popular-vote-vs-the-electoral-college/\n\x1b[92m[3] When the delegates at the Constitutional Convention decided to create an Electoral College to choose the president, their vision for how this group would work was somewhat idealistic.\x1b[0m In their minds, electors would be educated and distinguished citizens of each state who would be free to consider each presidential candidate. They envisioned that the electors would carefully discuss the qualifications of each candidate and engage in vigorous debate before casting their votes and sending them to Congress. And in our countryâs early elections the Electoral College did work this way because electors were chosen either by the state legislatures or by popular vote within each state. However, the development and rising power of political parties transformed this process from the Fathersâ idealistic vision. Over time, electors were no longer chosen for their distinction as citizens, but for their loyalty to a particular party. Today, electors are chosen at state party conventions or are appointed directly by party leaders. Each major party elects or appoints the same number of electors as the state has electoral votes. So, when the electors chosen in the November election meet in their respective state capitols in December, there is no vigorous debate about the presidential candidatesâ qualificationsâthe electors simply vote for their partyâs candidate.

The 23rd Amendment, ratified in 1961, assigns three additional electors to the District of Columbia, bringing the total number of electors to 538. To win, a presidential ticket must obtain a majority â 270 if all electors vote. Otherwise, the 12th Amendment provides that the House of Representatives chooses the president, with each state delegation receiving one vote, and the Senate chooses the vice president by majority vote.
