408,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_Act\n\x1b[92m[1] The Currency Act or Paper Bills of Credit Act is one of several Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain that regulated paper money issued by the colonies of British America\x1b[0m. The Acts sought to protect British merchants and creditors from being paid in depreciated colonial currency. The policy created tension between the colonies and Great Britain and was cited as a grievance by colonists early in the American Revolution. However, the consensus view among modern economic historians and economists is that the debts by colonists to British merchants were not a major cause of the Revolution. In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that 92% of economists and 74% of historians disagreed with the statement, 'The debts owed by colonists to British merchants and other private citizens constituted one of the most powerful causes leading to the Revolution.' Economic climate of the colonies "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_Act\n\x1b[96m[2] The first Act, the Currency Act 1751 (24 Geo\x1b[0m. \x1b[96m[3] 2. c. 53), restricted the issue of paper money and the establishment of new public banks by the colonies of New England\x1b[0m. These colonies had issued paper fiat money known as 'bills of credit' to help pay for military expenses during the French and Indian Wars. Because more paper money was issued than what was taxed out of circulation, the currency depreciated in relation to the British pound sterling. The resultant inflation was harmful to merchants in Great Britain, who were forced to accept the depreciated currency from colonists for payment of debts. The Act limited the future issue of bills of credit to certain circumstances. It allowed the existing bills to be used as legal tender for public debts (i.e. paying taxes), but did not allow their use for private debts (e.g. for paying merchants). Act of 1764 "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_Act\n\x1b[95m[4] The Currency Act 1764 (4 Geo\x1b[0m. \x1b[95m[5] 3. c. 34) extended the 1751 Act to all of the British colonies of North America\x1b[0m. Unlike the earlier Act, this statute did not prohibit the colonies from issuing paper money, but it did forbid them from designating future currency issues as legal tender for public and private debts. This tight money policy created financial difficulties in the colonies, where gold and silver were in short supply. \x1b[95m[6] Benjamin Franklin, a colonial agent in London, lobbied for repeal of the Act over the next several years, as did other agents\x1b[0m. The act arose when Virginia farmers continued to import during the French and Indian War. Virginia issued £250,000 in bills of credit to finance both public and private debts. This legislation differed from the 1751 act in that it prohibited the colonists from designating paper currency for use as payment for any debts, public or private. Parliament did not, however, prohibit the colonists from issuing paper money. The Act was put into place as a hedge against risks associated with economic fluctuations and uncertainty.

This version of ‘plain’ originated with Ernest Gowers’ Plain Words, a pamphlet commissioned by the Treasury (a government department) in 1948 that was supplemented by a second pamphlet The ABC of Plain Words in 1951, and then got combined into a single book The Complete Plain Words in 1954. You get the flavour of Gowers in this excerpt: Utilise and Utilisation These words are rarely needed, for the simple word use will almost always serve. The official (not a Government official) who wrote 'This document is forwarded herewith for the favour of your utilisation' might have written 'please use this form'. That says what needed to be said in four syllables instead of 21. Gowers, 1954 "", 'https://www.effortmark.co.uk/why-plain-language-and-plain-english-are-different/\nPlain language relies on testing with users. If the intended users can use the content to do what they need to do, it’s plain. If they can’t, it’s not plain. So you can only really know whether you have succeeded in writing in plain language when you have tested with the actual users. Plain language is much more flexible. For example, in Plain English there are lists of forbidden words. But in plain language, we accept that it’s OK to use the words that these users are familiar with. For example, when I’m writing for farmers about farm animals such as cows and pigs, I choose the word ‘livestock’ because that’s the one that farmers use. Be careful when you search and link Does it matter whether we talk about ‘Plain English’ or ‘plain language’? Not really: when talking to users, either is fine. ', ""https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html\nBut in the last few years, many of these offenders have started to put things right, either rewriting their documents clearly or training their staff in the art of plain English, or both. The main advantages of plain English are: \x1b[95m[3] it is faster to write; it is faster to read; and you get your message across more often, more easily and in a friendlier way\x1b[0m. If you spend more than an hour a day writing, you are to an extent a professional writer. So it's vital that you get it right. So what is plain English? It is a message, written with the reader in mind and with the right tone of voice, that is clear and concise. Keep your sentences short Most experts would agree that clear writing should have an average sentence length of 15 to 20 words.

Prior to 1984, the legal age when alcohol could be purchased in America varied from state to state. \x1b[92m[0] According to the CDC, after all states uniformly increased the legal drinking age to 21, they consequently saw a 16% median decline in motor vehicle crashes.After the enactment of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, states also saw a decrease in the binge drinking behavior of Americans under the age of 25.\x1b[0m Drinking during the previous month declined from 59% in 1985 to 40% in 1991 among Americans aged 18 to 20 years old. Drinking among people aged 21 to 25 declined from 70% in 1985 to 56% in 1991, the CDC reports. And according to the World Health Organization, those who avoid alcohol at a younger age are less likely to develop drinking problems later in life.In the decades since 1991, however, America has seen several problematic trends emerge in the drinking culture of its youth.

He is known for his wild, maniacal laughter. \x1b[92m[0] The Lion King Ed (left) and Banzai (right) In The Lion King, Ed tags along with the other two hyenas in the trio, Shenzi and Banzai.\x1b[0m When the hyenas first meet Simba and Nala in the Elephant Graveyard, Ed is the first to notice their escape. Ed nodded frantically when asked if he knew Simba was Mufasa's son, a fact that the other two hyenas tried to hide when cornered by Mufasa. He also made a low, sinister laugh when the hyenas overhear Scar say that the hyenas were the real enemy. \x1b[92m[3] The Lion King 1½ Along with Shenzi and Banzai, Ed appears in The Lion King 1½ in the beginning when the trio of hyenas attack Timon and at the end when Simba tries to retake the Pride Lands from Scar.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] Songs Be Prepared Trivia Ed is the only hyena with a name that does not have a meaning in Swahili.\x1b[0m "", ""https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai,_and_Ed\n\x1b[92m[2] The Lion King[] While hyenas were a common enemy in the Lion King SNES release, none of the hyenas fought were Shenzi, Banzai, or Ed.\x1b[0m Even the end-of-level boss hyena on the first level was not one of them. Once defeated, each hyena performed Ed's drooling 'salute' briefly before collapsing, but these hyenas lacked Ed's bitten ears. Banzai appears at the end of the 'Simba's Exile' level, but only to deliver his line 'If you ever come back, we'll kill ya!' The Lion King: Activity Center[] Ed appears in the 'Shadowlands' (referring clearly to Elephant Graveyard) section, mostly in two of its games: the Xylobone (he serves sometimes as the player's opponent, or he may let him or her play it freely) and the Stone Card Matching game (as one of three possible movie-exclusive character opponents, the other two being Simba and Nala). He also seems to appear in the maze game, but no hyena is ever specified there. \x1b[92m[5] The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure[]\x1b[0m "", ""https://thelionkingstimonandpumbaa.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed\n\x1b[92m[6] The three hyenas made occasional appearances in the TV series The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa.\x1b[0m While Jim Cummings reprised his role as Ed, Tress MacNeille and Rob Paulsen replaced Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin. The hyenas were also more noticeably dim-witted in the series in comparison to the movies. In addition, for unexplained reasons, they somehow managed to learn how to stand on their hind legs and are able to talk to humans. The hyenas had four 'skits' in which they starred, usually trying to get an easy meal. These were called 'The Laughing Hyenas'. "", 'https://screenrant.com/disney-lion-king-scar-chose-3-worst-hyenas/\n\x1b[92m[8] The names of the Lion King’s three most notable hyenas are Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, with Shenzi being the most intelligent of the three, followed by Banzai (though he has a vicious appetite and lack of true loyalty that makes him dangerous), and finally Ed, who’s arguably more of a liability than an asset.\x1b[0m The three were introduced in the Lion King as Scar’s secret henchman during Mufasa’s reign, and Scar used them to orchestrate Mufasa’s death in a way that made Simba think it was his fault before ordering them to do the final bit of dirty work for him and kill Simba (which, again, they failed to do). After that, Scar made them his lieutenants when he took over Pride Rock as king, and invited the rest of the hyenas to leave the Elephant Graveyard and join together with the lions in a position of authority. Until Simba came back and reclaimed his rightful place as king, the hyenas had it pretty good. As it turns out, their relatively good fortune under Scar was all thanks to the hyena’s original queen, who initially allowed Scar to recruit three of her subjects for his power-hungry plot. More specifically, she allowed Scar to recruit the three hyenas who were the most expendable.

While still as vicious and threatening as they are in the movie, the hyenas become more neutral as the show progresses. Though they are at first shown to be more dim-witted in comparison to the original film, they become wiser near the end of their first appearance and in later episodes, often coming up with clever ways to get their meal, though many of them end in failure. The hyenas have their own segments titled 'The Laughing Hyenas', which involve the trio searching for food after running away from the Pride Lands. Outside of their own segments, they appeared in flashbacks in 'Doubt of Africa' and 'Once Upon a Timon' and made a non-speaking appearance in 'Space Ham'. "", ""https://thelionkingstimonandpumbaa.fandom.com/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed\n\x1b[92m[9] His name means 'skulk' or 'lurk' in Swahili.\x1b[0m It can also mean 'die with honor' or 'ten thousand years' in Japanese, possibly a reference to his aggressive nature but more likely coincidental. His most distinguishing feature is his unusually heavy eyebrows. Apart from these, he is the model for most generic hyenas. He is the greediest of the three, frequently making references to being hungry, and asking for food. He also usually speaks and acts without thinking, losing his temper with Ed twice, and complaining when the Pride Lands lacks food under Scar's rule ('It's dinnertime, and we ain't got no stinkin' entrees!'). He even quietly remarks to his friends that Mufasa was a better king than Scar. In addition, when about to commence the Wildebeest Stampede, he almost tried to kill and eat a sick Wildebeest before Scar gave them the signal, but was stopped by Shenzi, reminding him about waiting for Scar's signal.

His buttocks are severely lacerated by Mufasa's sharp claws, causing him great pain when he sits ('I won't be able to sit for a week!'). In 'Be Prepared', Banzai is fired out of a geyser and handled roughly by Scar. Then when he and the others chase Simba out of the Pride Lands, Banzai is knocked into the thorns and ends up with many in his body. \x1b[92m[4] Ed (voiced by Jim Cummings) is the only hyena without a Swahili name, though there exists in English the word eddy meaning whirlpool.\x1b[0m Ed's distinguishing features are two round cuts on each ear, his tongue often lolls from his mouth and he doesn't have eyebrows. \x1b[92m[10] He doesn't speak and instead communicates through laughter, which he also seems to have difficulty holding back.\x1b[0m Jim Cummings recorded over four hours of various laughter clips for any situation Ed might be in; excited, amused, angry, etc. ""]",what is the name of the hyena in lion king,"The name of the hyena in ""The Lion King"" is Ed [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m[92m[8][0m[92m[9][0m.

393,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge\n\x1b[92m[1] The Golden Gate Bridge\x1b[0m is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. It also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and is designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95. Recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the Wonders of the Modern World, the bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California.

By the late 1970s, 'The Fool on the Hill' was one of McCartney's most widely recorded ballads.

According to McCartney, the song possibly relates to a character such as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Beatles' meditation teacher: "", ""https://www.movement.org.uk/blog/beatles-fool-hill\nIn 1967, The Beatles released their album Magical Mystery Tour, which marked the peak of the band’s collective fascination with Hinduism and psychedelics. \x1b[92m[4] For this album Paul McCartney penned his song The Fool on the Hill, which follows the story of a misunderstood man who is perceived by others as foolish but is, in fact, encapsulated by wisdom.\x1b[0m The song was written about spiritual master, Maharishi,\u202fwith whom he and the other Beatles had bonded in India. However, feelings for Maharishi shifted a year later when the band recorded a ‘diss track’ titled Sexy Sadie in which John Lennon accuses Maharishi of breaking 'the rules' and making 'a fool of everyone' who loves him. This followed an alleged inappropriate advance on actress Mia Farrow by Maharishi. The guru died leaving behind excessive wealth and serious allegations of cult-like behaviour and sexual misconduct, most of which remain speculative.

In addition, when about to commence the wildebeest stampede, he complained to Shenzi that he wanted to attack the wildebeest early, which would have thrown the whole plan off, but was stopped by Shenzi, reminding him to wait.

When working with more than one event, you have to be concerned as to whether the first event affects the second event. When determining if events are independent, you are determining if the events are affecting one another. \x1b[92m[6] Independent Events Two events are said to be independent if the result of the second event is not affected by the result of the first event.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] The probability of one event does not change the probability of the other event.\x1b[0m If A and B are independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events. If A and B are independent events, "", 'https://www.cuemath.com/data/independent-events/\nIf the probability of events A and B is P(A) and P(B) respectively, then the two events are independent if any of the following are true: P(A|B)=P(A), P(B|A)=P(B) and P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B) How Do You Tell if an Event Is Independent or Dependent? \x1b[92m[0] Two events A and B are said to be independent if the fact that one event has occurred does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other.\x1b[0m Also if the occurrence of one event affects the probability of occurrence of the other event, then the two events are said to be dependent. Can an Event Be Mutually Exclusive and Independent Event? Mutually exclusive in math are a set of events that cannot happen at the same time. For example: when tossing a coin, the result can either be heads or tails but cannot be both. This of course means mutually exclusive events are not independent, and independent events cannot be mutually exclusive. Are Independent Events Disjoint? ', 'https://byjus.com/maths/independent-events/\nIndependent events are those events whose occurrence is not dependent on any other event. For example, if we flip a coin in the air and get the outcome as Head, then again if we flip the coin but this time we get the outcome as Tail. In both cases, the occurrence of both events is independent of each other. It is one of the types of events in probability. Let us learn here the complete definition of independent events along with its Venn diagram, examples and how it is different from mutually exclusive events. What are Independent Events? In Probability, the set of outcomes of an experiment is called events. There are different types of events such as independent events, dependent events, mutually exclusive events, and so on. \x1b[92m[2] If the probability of occurrence of an event A is not affected by the occurrence of another event B, then A and B are said to be independent events.\x1b[0m ', ""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conditional_probability.asp\n\x1b[92m[1] Two events are said to be independent if one event occurring does not affect the probability that the other event will occur.\x1b[0m However, if one event occurring (or not occurring) does affect the likelihood that the other event will happen, the two events are said to be dependent. An example of dependent events is a company's stock price increasing after the company reports higher-than-expected earnings. If events are independent, then the probability of event B occurring is not contingent on what happens with event A. For example, an increase in Apple's shares has nothing to do with a drop in wheat prices. Conditional probability is often written as the 'probability of A given B' and notated as P(A|B).

For example, in XHTML, the root element is <html>, being the first element opened (after the doctype declaration) and last closed. Since the syntax for the external identifier and internal subset are both optional,:\u200a403–404\u200a the document type name is the only information which it is mandatory to give in a DOCTYPE declaration. External identifier The DOCTYPE declaration can optionally contain an external identifier, following the root element name (and separating syntax such as spaces), but before any internal subset.:\u200a403–404\u200a This begins with either the keyword SYSTEM or the keyword PUBLIC,:\u200a379\u200a specifying whether the DTD is specified using a public identifier identifying it as a public text, i.e. one shared between multiple computer systems (regardless of whether it is an available public text available to the general public, or an unavailable public text shared only within an organisation).:\u200a180–182\u200a If the PUBLIC keyword is used, it is followed by the public identifier enclosed in double or single ASCII quotation marks.

The text/html serialization of HTML5, which is not SGML-based, uses the DOCTYPE only for mode selection. Since web browsers are implemented with special-purpose HTML parsers, rather than general-purpose DTD-based parsers, they do not use DTDs and never access them even if a URL is provided.

The play is one of a triad of tragedies known as the three Theban plays, following Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus. \x1b[92m[1] Even though the events in Antigone occur last in the order of events depicted in the plays, Sophocles wrote Antigone first.\x1b[0m The story expands on the Theban legend that predates it, and it picks up where Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes ends. The play is named after the main protagonist Antigone. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles\n\x1b[92m[4] Sophocles[a] (c. 497/496 – winter 406/405 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, known as one of three from whom at least one play has survived in full.\x1b[0m His first plays were written later than, or contemporary with, those of Aeschylus; and earlier than, or contemporary with, those of Euripides. \x1b[92m[2] Sophocles wrote over 120 plays, but only seven have survived in a complete form: Ajax, Antigone, Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra, Philoctetes, and Oedipus at Colonus.\x1b[0m For almost fifty years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens which took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. He competed in thirty competitions, won twenty-four, and was never judged lower than second place. Aeschylus won thirteen competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles; Euripides won four. ', 'https://femminaclassica.com/analyzing-antigone/\nTo begin to understand the psyche of Antigone, it is important to get a grasp from whence she came. Because mythology was ubiquitous to the ancient Greeks, the audience would have been all too familiar with Oedipus’s woeful tale and the cursed Laius family. Frequently performed in mythological sequence, Sophocles’ Theban saga—-Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone—- was written out of sequence and therefore not considered a trilogy in the manner of Aeschylus’ Oresteia. Each play of the Theban saga is a unit unto itself. \x1b[92m[3] Although the events in Antigone come last in the saga, in actuality, Sophocles wrote Antigone first (in about 442 BCE), preceding Oedipus the King by about twelve years.\x1b[0m Thus, the Creon in Antigone has an altogether different persona than the Creon in Oedipus the King.

First-time director John Lasseter sensed a chance to make a different kind of animated film, with jokes designed to appeal to an adult audience, and an emotional resonance that had been missing in traditional animation. Lasseter knew it would require songs a cut above the usual fare in terms of sophistication, as he told Entertainment Weekly in 1995: '[Newman’s] songs are touching, witty and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.'

He was created by Dick Wolf and Michael S. Chernuchin and has been portrayed by Sam Waterston during the show's original run from 1994 to 2010 and again from 2022 until his retirement in 2024. He is the longest-tenured character on the show, appearing in 19 seasons. He has appeared in 405 episodes of Law & Order, four episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, two episodes of Law & Order: Trial by Jury, two episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street, and the made-for-TV movie Exiled.[citation needed] Waterston's performance as McCoy on the New York–based series was so popular that it resulted in him being declared a 'Living Landmark' by the New York Landmarks Conservancy, along with fellow longtime series cast member Jerry Orbach (who portrayed the popular police detective Lennie Briscoe for almost 12 years). Character overview McCoy \x1b[92m[2] is introduced as Executive Assistant District Attorney by Adam Schiff (Steven Hill) in the season five premiere episode 'Second Opinion'\x1b[0m. He has been nicknamed 'Hang 'em High McCoy'. He describes himself as a 'junkyard dog'. He is well-respected in the legal community, once referred to as 'the top of the legal food chain' by a rival attorney during a trial. Following the 17th season (2006–2007), McCoy is appointed interim district attorney, taking over from Arthur Branch (Fred Thompson). McCoy's appearance on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit on the November 13, 2007, episode 'Blinded', marked his first appearance in the Law & Order universe as district attorney. Law & Order originally ceased production in 2010, but McCoy (though not seen) was still occasionally mentioned as being the Manhattan DA in the spin-off series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in several episodes through 2011. A reference to 'the new DA' in a 2013 SVU episode would indicate that McCoy had moved on from the position presumably sometime in 2012; his replacement was unnamed. However, McCoy was the DA again as of 2018, showing up in the SVU episode 'The Undiscovered Country'. In 2022, he appeared as the DA in the revival of the original Law & Order, with ADAs Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy) and Samantha Maroun (Odelya Halevi) working under him.

The song was written by Kygo, Gomez, Brian Lee, Ali Tamposi, and Andrew Watt and produced by Kygo, Watt and Louis Bell. An EDM, dance-pop, electropop and tropical house song, 'It Ain't Me' comprises an acoustic guitar line, and a build-drop arrangement in its chorus featuring pulsing piano notes, bass, synthesizers, finger-snap claps and pan flute melodies. Gomez sings the track in a husky tone, while in the chorus her vocals are reduced to recurring syllables. The lyrics narrate a past relationship ruined by alcoholism. The lyrics to 'It Ain't Me' were written by Andrew Watt, Brian Lee and Ali Tamposi. With Watt previously working with Kygo, the DJ's manager Myles Shear contacted Watt for a session with Kygo which Watt also facilitated for Lee and Tamposi. During their session for 'It Ain't Me', they initially found the track very poor, but were trying to salvage it. Kygo and Shear suggested that they continue working on the song. After Kygo and Shear had left, Tamposi told Watt and Lee to play guitar and 'Fleetwood Mac it', spawning a 45-minute jam session as well as the demo of 'It Ain't Me', a simple acoustic guitar recording with Tamposi on vocals. Watt, Lee and Tamposi then asked Kygo to return to their studio to hear 'It Ain't Me' for a second time. Tamposi recalled, 'When they pushed the space bar to play the song, [Kygo] went from this very sweet, polite, charming young man to this super-human producer guy. I was watching his eyes go back, left and right, just mapping out how he envisioned the production of the song. He was extremely excited'.

This 'stand your ground law' has been used in numerous high-profile court cases. Many of the citizens of Alabama feel the law is fair. Still, critics often argue that it gives you far too much leeway to utilize deadly force and that it may disproportionately affect minorities. The law’s proponents say it is a necessary and soundly based legal tool for self-defense and is applied justly in most cases. The 'stand your ground' law in Alabama, in many ways, transformed the legal approach in self-defense cases. For example, if you believe you are in imminent threat of severe bodily harm or death, you should be able to use deadly or physical force in your defense. "", ""https://giffords.org/lawcenter/state-laws/stand-your-ground-in-alabama/\nSelf-defense laws in the US typically justify a person’s use of lethal force in public in situations where lethal force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or another person. Traditionally, these laws have been clear that taking human life is not necessary, and is therefore not justified, if the person could have avoided using lethal violence by retreating, or simply stepping away from a confrontation. A person does not have a duty to retreat from a conflict before using force in their home, however (known as the Castle Doctrine).1 Stand your ground laws upend centuries of legal tradition, allowing a person to use deadly force in self-defense in public, even if that force can be safely avoided by retreating or when nonlethal force would suffice. \x1b[92m[1] Alabama LawAlabama has adopted a stand your ground statute that removes the duty to retreat before using deadly force 'in any place where [a person] has the right to be.\x1b[0m'2MEDIA REQUESTSOur experts can speak to the full spectrum of gun violence prevention issues.

Kentucky Revised Statutes Section 503.050 describes situations in which the use of force, including deadly force, in self-protection is justifiable. It provides that a person does not have a duty to retreat prior to the use of deadly force. \x1b[92m[2] Furthermore, Section 503.055 provides that a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where they have a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand their ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if the person reasonably believes that this is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to someone else or them, or to prevent the commission of a felony involving the use of force.\x1b[0m ', 'https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/stand-your-ground-laws-50-state-survey/\nMinnesota generally imposes a duty to retreat. In State v. Carothers, the Minnesota Supreme Court explained that someone who kills someone else in self-defense must have attempted to retreat if reasonably possible. However, there is no duty to retreat in defense of dwelling situations, or when these circumstances are characterized as self-defense in the home. Mississippi Stand Your Ground Law Mississippi has a statutory stand your ground rule. Mississippi Code Section 97-3-15 describes situations in which a homicide is justifiable. \x1b[92m[3] When it is justifiable based on grounds such as self-defense or defense of others, a person who is not the initial aggressor and is not engaged in unlawful activity has no duty to retreat before using deadly force if the person is in a place where they have a right to be.\x1b[0m A judge or jury must not consider their failure to retreat as evidence that their use of force was unnecessary, excessive, or unreasonable.

Nobility directories like the Almanach de Gotha often abbreviate the noble term von to v. In medieval or early modern names, the von particle was at times added to commoners' names; thus, Hans von Duisburg meant 'Hans from [the city of] Duisburg'.

The Justices Over the years, various Acts of Congress have altered the number of seats on the Supreme Court, from a low of five to a high of 10. Shortly after the Civil War, the number of seats on the Court was fixed at nine. Today, there is one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Like all federal judges, justices are appointed by the President and are confirmed by the Senate. They, typically, hold office for life. The salaries of the justices cannot be decreased during their term of office. These restrictions are meant to protect the independence of the judiciary from the political branches of government. The Court's Jurisdiction Article III, Section II of the Constitution establishes the jurisdiction (legal ability to hear a case) of the Supreme Court. \x1b[92m[2] The Court has original jurisdiction (a case is tried before the Court) over certain cases, e.g., suits between two or more states and/or cases involving ambassadors and other public ministers\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] The Court has appellate jurisdiction (the Court can hear the case on appeal) on almost any other case that involves a point of constitutional and/or federal law\x1b[0m. Some examples include cases to which the United States is a party, cases involving Treaties, and cases involving ships on the high seas and navigable waterways (admiralty cases).

Released as a single two months after the film's premiere, it became a worldwide hit, reaching the Top 10 in several countries. The song became one of Dylan's most popular and most covered post-1960s compositions, spawning covers from Eric Clapton, Guns N' Roses, Randy Crawford, and more. Described by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin as 'an exercise in splendid simplicity', the song features two short verses, the lyrics of which comment directly on the scene in the film for which it was written: the death of a frontier lawman (Slim Pickens) who refers to his wife (Katy Jurado) as 'Mama'. It was ranked number 190 in 2004 by Rolling Stone magazine, in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and number 192 in 2010. Musicians Bob Dylan: vocals, guitar In January 1975 Eric Clapton played on Arthur Louis's recording of 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' which was arranged in a cross-over reggae style. After the recording sessions with Louis, Clapton recorded his own version of the song which was released as a single in August 1975 two weeks after Louis's version. This version was released on Timepieces: The Best of Eric Clapton. Clapton's version made it to No. 38 on the UK charts, but the single was less successful in the U.S. where it failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 (although it reached on No. 109 on Cashbox's Looking Ahead chart). Clapton's 1996 boxed set Crossroads 2: Live in the Seventies features a performance of the song recorded in London in April 1977. There were also performances of the song included on the Journeyman (1990) and the One More Car, One More Rider (2003) world tours. Several Clapton compilation albums also feature the song.

That is the nature of convex mirrors. It's part of the rules of OPTICS AND PHYSICS. You can't change that in any reality! It is IMPOSSIBLE! However, for many of us, our anchor memories tell us that it did indeed use to say 'Objects in mirror may be closer than they appear' We remember thinking about the warning and asking ourselves and others when would objects be closer or not closer; what's up with the 'may be'? These thoughts and discussions are parts of our anchor memories that do not deceive us. Our memories of the warning saying 'may be' are correct! There are also tons of residue from the media, newspaper clippings and advertisements, the entertainment industry making jokes about this inscription, etc...

Background: 'Patience is a virtue' is a proverb, which is a short statement that expresses a culturally accepted truth. In this case, the phrase conveys the idea that accepting delayed gratification is a socially desirable trait. The idea that patience is a good trait to cultivate has been around for a very long time.

Patience is also praised in the New Testament, the Qur’an, the Bhagavad Gita, the Tipitaka, and other religious scriptures created throughout the ages. Equating patience with virtue may hale back to the Latin text, Distichs of Cato. This collection of proverbs, written around the 2nd or 3rd century, was commonly used as a Latin primer through the 18th century. In it, the unnamed author writes, 'Of human virtues, patience is most great.' Geoffrey Chaucer relied heavily on this work for his Canterbury Tales (c.1400CE). In The Franklin’s Tale his narrator states, 'Pacience is an heigh vertu' (translating to 'patience is a high virtue' or 'patience is a conquering virtue'). Another work often credited with originating the phrase 'patience is a virtue' is Piers Plowman, written by English poet William Langland. The work, penned in 1360 CE, has the titular character, an exceptionally moral man, leading several individuals on a quest for moral enlightenment, and contains the line 'patience is a fair virtue.'

Two years later, in 1824, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (which became the Royal SPCA in 1840) was established. The society focused especially on enforcement of the law, with prosecutions where appropriate. In 1835, the Act was amended to protect domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, against cruelty. \x1b[92m[0] The first American animal protection organization, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was established in 1866.\x1b[0m By 1900, several hundred other animal protection organizations had formed in America. In 1860, the Battersea Dogs’ Home was established by Mr. Mary Tealby, the first woman to found a British animal welfare organization.

"", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_Gabba_Gabba!\nIn 2021 it was announced that the series would be revived for Apple TV+. In April 2024 it was confirmed that the revival series, titled Yo Gabba Gabbaland!, would consist of 10 new episodes and would premiere on August 9, 2024. Apple TV+ has also acquired the previous episodes and specials for its service. Overview Hosted by a musician named DJ Lance Rock, \x1b[96m[1] the series features live-action segments featuring 5 costumed toys: Muno (a red cyclops), Foofa (a pink flower bubble), Brobee (a green broccoli bee/monster), Toodee (a blue cat-dragon), and Plex (a yellow robot)\x1b[0m. In between the main segments are many short animated sketches and songs. Among the varied animation sequences during the show was 'Super Martian Robot Girl', designed by indie cartoonists Evan Dorkin and Sarah Dyer. The title character of the segment was voiced by Ariela Barer in season one and Caroline Jacobs in season three. Kidrobot made the toy models of the characters that appear at the beginning and end of each episode. The title of the show pays homage to 'Gabba Gabba Hey' by the punk rock band Ramones. History Yo Gabba Gabba! was developed by two Southern California fathers and punk rockers, Christian Jacobs (best known under the stage persona The MC Bat Commander in The Aquabats) and Scott Schultz, who first started working together as teenagers, producing and directing skateboarding videos. Their goal was to design a kids' show that was entertaining while featuring real artists and real performers. Both had no past experience writing scripts for television, let alone children's broadcasting or education. In developing the show they took inspiration from a number of classic children's series including Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Pee-wee's Playhouse, Zoom, as well as Sid and Marty Krofft puppet shows The Banana Splits and H. R. Pufnstuf.

By comparison ocean water is approximately 35 PPT.  The salinity of the Sea increases every year.  As the Sea evaporates every year all of the salt delivered to it is left behind thereby increasing the salinity with each passing year. How many fish and what kind of fish are in the Salton Sea? Soon after the Salton Sea formed in 1905 many types of fish were stocked into the Sea for sport and commercial fishing purposes. In fact the Sea was a major sport fishing destination for nearly 60 years. At the beginning, the Sea was not salty and would support many different types of fish. As the Sea reached salt levels similar to the ocean many ocean species were stocked into the Sea as well. The salinity has unfortunately reached a point where \x1b[92m[1] it is assumed that the only species of fish that presently inhabit the Sea are the algae eating tilapia, that were introduced into the All American Canal for algae control in the 1960s, and the endangered, indigenous pupfish\x1b[0m. The tilapia have managed to adapt to the high salt levels however scientists believe that the salinity is reaching a tipping point where even the tilapia will soon have a massive die-off. It was estimated in the 1990s that the Sea was home to millions of tilapia. How is the Sea filled today?

The 30-mile long body of water was created by an accident that diverted most of the flow of the Colorado River into the desert sink in the Imperial Valley in 1905. The flow wasn’t stopped for 18 months, and the sea was born. In the early years, it was a freshwater fishery, but soon the salinity became too great for the bass and catfish that had washed into the lake. In the 1950s, the DFG experimented with a whole variety of saltwater species, and three took. Do you remember when?

The lower a substance's pH (less than 7), the more acidic it is; the higher a substance's pH (greater than 7), the more alkaline it is. Normal rain has a pH of about 5.6; it is slightly acidic because carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolves into it forming weak carbonic acid.  Acid rain usually has a pH between 4.2 and 4.4.

The NADP/NTN collects acid rain at more than 250 monitoring sites throughout the US, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii and the US Virgin Islands. Unlike wet deposition, dry deposition is difficult and expensive to measure.

In 1996 and with the consent of Dylan, Scottish musician Ted Christopher wrote a new verse for 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' in memory of the schoolchildren and teacher killed in the Dunblane school massacre. This has been, according to some sources, one of the few times Dylan has officially authorized anybody to add or change the lyrics to one of his songs.This version of the song, including children from the village singing the chorus with guitarist and producer of Dylan's album Infidels (1983), Mark Knopfler, was released on December 9 in the UK and reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The proceeds went to charities for children.

This appeared on the cover of his eponymous first album, recorded at Columbia Records’ New York studios in November 1961. \x1b[92m[9] Bob Dylan wrote Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door for the 1973 movie Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\x1b[0m  The song appears in the scene where a frontier sheriff, played by Slim Pickens, is dying.  He refers to his wife, played by Katy Jurado, as 'Mama.' The version of this song that was used in the movie was specifically orchestrated for that film.  After the release of the movie, the song was re-recorded as a single record.  That version featured Roger McGuinn on guitar, Jim Keltner on drums, Booker T. Jones on bass, and Carl Fortina on harmonium. Bob Dylan was famous for songs with rather cryptic lyrics; however, Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door was an exercise in extreme simplicity. There are just two verses and a repetitive chorus.

The song became one of Dylan's most popular and most covered post-1960s compositions, spawning covers from Eric Clapton, Guns N' Roses, Randy Crawford, and more. Described by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin as 'an exercise in splendid simplicity', the song features two short verses, the lyrics of which comment directly on the scene in the film for which it was written: the death of a frontier lawman (Slim Pickens) who refers to his wife (Katy Jurado) as 'Mama'. It was ranked number 190 in 2004 by Rolling Stone magazine, in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and number 192 in 2010.

At the time, it mainly became known for Bob’s hit, Knocking In Heaven’s Door.Amazingly, another tune (Wagon Wheel) was half recorded during this time but scrapped by Bob who can be heard mumbling the chorus on a bootleg recording. Later finished by Ketch Secor (2004) who wrote the verses, it became a huge hit in the hands of Nathan Carter (2012) and Darius Rucker (2013).

Eric reprises the reggae-style version of this tune, just as with Arthur Louis.  The steady-rocking reggae beat works very well with Eric’s stately and impressive licks on his Fender Stratocaster guitar. By the way, one of Eric Clapton’s favorite Fender Stratocaster guitars was auctioned off in May 2021.  Here is a photo of that guitar.

The full rehearsal session, which featured Del Rey's pre-recorded vocals and were created with the intent of aiding the tour's videographer, leaked on October 15, 2020. Del Rey's vocals are not featured on the cover, which serves as an instrumental outro to 'Without You'.

A lot of these ideas did not come through in the original release cut, the studio used some six editors to hack Peckinpah’s movie to pieces.

Britain had never given such a pledge to an eastern European country. There had never been a special relationship with Poland. Even Winston Churchill was amazed.'His Majesty's Government have given a guarantee to Poland. I was astounded when I heard them give this guarantee,' he told MPs in May 1939, when still a backbencher.So why did Britain do it? The answer of course, had less to do with Poland, and much more to do with Nazi Germany. In March 1939, Poland's southern neighbour Czechoslovakia fell apart. Adolf Hitler's German forces moved in, and Britain's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain decided that Germany could not be allowed to threaten another country. Few people remember that Britain didn't just offer support to Poland. It also pledged to help Greece and Romania, should either of those countries be attacked. Chamberlain called the assurances 'first aid treatment' - an admission that the pledges were made in a hurry, with no thought to how such promises might be honoured. Britain hoped that would be enough - it was not. Germany attacked and defeated Poland in a few weeks.

And like its southern neighbor, Canada’s gun laws have often been driven by gun violence. In 1989, a student armed with a semiautomatic rifle killed fourteen students and injured more than a dozen others at a Montreal engineering school. The incident is widely credited with driving major gun reforms that imposed a twenty-eight-day waiting period for purchases; mandatory safety training courses; more detailed background checks; bans on large-capacity magazines; and bans or greater restrictions on military-style firearms and ammunition. Firearms in Canada are divided into three classes: nonrestricted weapons, such as ordinary rifles and shotguns; restricted, such as handguns and semiautomatic rifles/shotguns; and prohibited, such as automatic weapons. It is illegal to own a fully automatic weapon unless it was registered before 1978. ', 'https://www.slaw.ca/2020/05/03/no-right-to-bear-arms-in-canada/\n[11] Accordingly, \x1b[96m[1] it is my opinion that the preamble to the British North America Act, 1867 did not incorporate into Canada’s statutes the right of certain persons to bear firearms which was contained in the Bill of Rights 1689\x1b[0m. [12] Furthermore, it is clear that even in England, under the Bill of Rights 1689, the right to bear arms was not unqualified. The qualifications were: (1) its application was to the subjects who were Protestants; and (2) armed for their defence; and (3) suitable to their conditions; and (4) as allowed by law. The first three conditions relate to the political situation at the time the declaration was passed. A previous king, who was Catholic, had for a time prohibited other religions from bearing arms. As a result, people of those other religions felt that they were unable to appropriately defend themselves. As well, suitable to their conditions would also have been a reference to the political situation at that time which favoured landed gentlemen.

'In the olden days, the eldest son would get the farm, and his bride would be expected to come with sufficient dowry to pay off the other siblings.' Modern family formations have complicated matters — mirrored by Ambridge’s raft of divorces, remarriages, estrangements, step-children and illegitimate sons. There are several older characters whose deaths could trigger a bitter inheritance battle, surely a storyline many FT listeners would savour.

The Port Huron Statement decried what it described as "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society\nBy the end of the academic year, there were over 200 delegates at the annual convention at Pine Hill, New York, from 32 different colleges and universities. The convention chose a confederal structure. Policy and direction would be discussed in a quarterly conclave of chapter delegates, the National Council. National officers, in the spirit of 'participatory democracy', would be selected annually by consensus. Lee Webb of Boston University was chosen as National Secretary, and Todd Gitlin of Harvard University was made president. In 1963 'racial equality' remained the cause celebre. In November 1963, the Swarthmore College chapter of SDS partnered with Stanley Branche and local parents to create the Committee for Freedom Now which led the Chester school protests along with the NAACP in Chester, Pennsylvania.

The island is covered with more than 100 volcanoes. Some are extinct, but over 30 are still active. The majority of volcanism in Iceland occurs along volcanic rift zones that cut through the centre of the island. At constructive plate boundaries, also known as divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move away from one another to produce volcanoes. Hot magma rises from the mantle at mid-ocean ridges, pushing the plates apart. BGS © UKRI. Note: Iceland also sits above a mantle plume, or hot spot, where hot magma wells up from deep in the Earth’s mantle. The interaction of these two types of volcanism, over the last 15 million years or more, has created the island of Iceland.

Iceland, however, is also associated with a mantle plume (a narrow stem of upwelling of magma from deep in the mantle) that has maintained volcanism high and vigorous [1]. Spreading creates some sort of symmetry in the buildup of the island (although slightly distorted by the mantle plume) with the youngest rocks situated on the ridge and the older rocks away from the ridge on both sides (Figure 1). ', ""https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html\nThe volcanic country of Iceland, which straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, offers scientists a natural laboratory for studying on land the processes also occurring along the submerged parts of a spreading ridge.

The consequences of plate movement are easy to see around Krafla Volcano, in the northeastern part of Iceland. Here, existing ground cracks have widened and new ones appear every few months. From 1975 to 1984, numerous episodes of rifting (surface cracking) took place along the Krafla fissure "", ""https://www.icelandontheweb.com/articles-on-iceland/nature/geology/tectonic-plates\n\x1b[92m[4] The tectonic plates move towards east and west, and both the North American and Eurasian systems move to the northwest across the hot spot.\x1b[0m On top of hot spots there's generally a 20-100% molten layer at the depth of 5-20 km, which supplies sufficient material for eruptions. Eruptions occur about every 5-10 years and primarily consist of basaltic lava and tephra. A few long-lived centres, such as the volcano Hekla, erupt more silicic magmas. Iceland's topography "", ""https://news.uoregon.edu/icelands-volcano-eruptions-may-last-decades-researchers-find\nAlmost all of Iceland’s island is built from lava, said Ilya Bindeman, a volcanologist and earth sciences professor at the UO. \x1b[92m[5] The country sits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the tectonic plate boundary that causes North America and Eurasia to push further apart.\x1b[0m The drifting of these plates can spark volcanic eruptions when hot rock from the earth’s mantle — the middle and largest layer of the planet — melts and rises to the surface.Although scientists know the origin of Reykjanes Peninsula’s current eruptions is plate movement, the kind of magma storage and plumbing systems that feed them are unidentified, Bindeman said. The peninsula consists of eight volcanically active sites, so understanding whether there is one shared magma source or multiple independent ones and their depth can help predict the duration and impact of these eruptions.Using geochemical and seismic data, the researchers investigated whether the magma of the initial eruptions from one volcano in the peninsula from 2021 to 2023 came from the same source as the magma in the recent eruptions of a different volcano to the west. Bindeman specializes in isotopic analysis, which can help identify the 'fingerprint' of magma. (See Focus on Equipment and Methodology below.) The unique combination of trace elements can help differentiate one magma source from another.

Because its history has always been closely related to volcanism, many volcanic eruptions since the middle ages have been recorded and preserved. Iceland was settled in 834 AD, established its own parliament in 930 AD and recorded its first historical volcanic eruption ~934 AD, during which Eldagia, the longest volcanic fissure in the world, was created. Due to the amount of volcanic activity – averaging one every three years – and the resulting devastation to the country of Iceland from lava, ash and sometimes years of famine, there is a well documented record of Icelandic volcanic eruptions. The volcanic materials settle onto the nearby Greenland ice sheet and become incorporated into the ice core record.

It is the second single from their debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005), and was released in the United States as a digital download on November 16, 2005. The song is built upon a pizzicato cello motif that was played by session musician Heather Stebbins. It reached a peak of No. 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100, the band's only top-40 hit until the release of 'Hallelujah' in 2015, and only top-10 hit until 'High Hopes' in 2018. While the song failed to reach the top 10 of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, peaking at No. 12, the song's success on the Hot 100 and Mainstream Top 40 (at No. 2) made the song one of the biggest modern rock hits of 2006, and it is still one of the band's most-played songs on alternative radio stations. "", ""https://groundupideas.wordpress.com/2018/07/26/day-21-trade-mistakes-panic-at-the-disco/\nIt’s fun to think what our first dance might be. Of course, it will probably ultimately end up depending on who I marry. But again, it’s fun to consider some possibilites. There are those good old fashioned love songs, or you could put a bit more umph into them. My brother and his wife danced to 'Strangers in the Night' by Frank Sinatra, which was meaningful to both of them (and yes, I cried.) Something that has deep meaning to two people at once is beautiful. This one, however, might be seen as a strange option. Day Twenty-One: Trade Mistakes – Panic! At the Disco "", ""https://groundupideas.wordpress.com/2018/07/26/day-21-trade-mistakes-panic-at-the-disco/\n'Trade Mistakes' comes from Panic!’s 2011 album Vices and Virtues, released not long after some influential people left the band. And like the album title, Vices and Virtues is interwoven with just that – the human journey through pain, happiness, and well, vices and virtues. The fact is, we’ll make allowances for vices if we love someone enough. Of course, we all have the proverbial end of our ropes. But everyone we love is going to be flawed and need 'saving,' so to speak. We’ll make excuses for vices because we care about the person and don’t want others to look down on them. Not always the best way to love someone, but it’s pretty common. It’s okay to love someone. But it’s not okay to love someone in spite of yourself. So there’s my wedding song. Maybe.

This is done to take advantage of the wider angle that can be reflected by a Convex mirror. A convex mirror, also known as diverging mirror, is one which bulges at the middle and is thinner at the edges. While this captures a wider object field, it does so at the cost of image accuracy. The result is compression of the reflected image, which makes objects appear smaller and farther away than they really are. The warning is mentioned in the mirrors so that the driver can accordingly make adjustments and take a well calculated decision.

The carbohydrate molecules are obtained from the carbon dioxide from the use of chemical energy gathered during the reactions. The Light energy tends to split into the water and later extracts the electrons from the photosystem II; then the electrons move from the PSII to b6f (cytochrome) to the photosystem I (PSI) and reduce in the form of energy. ', 'https://www.albert.io/blog/photosynthesis-and-cellular-respiration-ap-biology-crash-course/\nThe process of photosynthesis is an essential AP® Biology concept to understand.  Photosynthesis is the means by which most of the plant life on Earth gets its energy.  All animals receive nutrients either from plants or from animals that get their energy from plants.  This means that plants are the basis for all of the ecosystems on Earth, making photosynthesis a very important process.  So, in order to understand how photosynthesis happens, biologists have to break it down into two parts, the light and dark reactions. 1. \x1b[92m[5] Light Reaction (or the Light-Dependent Reactions) This is the first step in the process of photosynthesis.\x1b[0m  \x1b[92m[6] The light reaction is the process by which the leaf of a plant will absorb energy from the sun (in the form of photons) and will transfer it into electron carriers and energy (in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP).\x1b[0m ', ""https://byjus.com/biology/light-dependent-reactions/\n\x1b[92m[1] 'Light reaction is the process of photosynthesis that converts energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP.'\x1b[0m What is Light Reaction? The light reaction is also known as photolysis reaction and takes place in the presence of light. It usually takes place in the grana of chloroplasts. The photosystems have pigment molecules. \x1b[92m[7] In the plants, chlorophyll is one of the primary pigments which actively takes part in the process of light reactions like photosynthesis.\x1b[0m The accessory pigments include carotenoids. The energy from the sun is absorbed by the chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts. The energy is then transferred to ATP and NADPH that is generated by two-electron transport chains. Water is used and oxygen is released during the process. Let us have an overview of light reaction and the mechanism involved in light reaction. Also Read: Cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation Process of Light Reaction "", ""https://omexcanada.com/blog/manganese-in-water-splitting-photosynthesis/\nFigure 2. \x1b[92m[9] Light energy is absorbed by a chlorophyll molecule and is passed along a pathway to other chlorophyll molecules.\x1b[0m The energy culminates in a molecule of chlorophyll found in the reaction center. The energy 'excites' one of its electrons enough to leave the molecule and be transferred to a nearby primary electron acceptor. A molecule of water splits to release an electron, which is needed to replace the one donated. Oxygen and hydrogen ions are also formed from the splitting of water. Source: https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-2-the-light-dependent-reactions-of-photosynthesis/ For more information, watch the narrated Youtube video: "", ""https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-1-overview-of-photosynthesis/\nPhotosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. \x1b[92m[2] In the light-dependent reactions, which take place at the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy with the use of water.\x1b[0m The light-dependent reactions release oxygen from the hydrolysis of water as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules. The two reactions use carrier molecules to transport the energy from one to the other. The carriers that move energy from the light-dependent reactions to the Calvin cycle reactions can be thought of as 'full' because they bring energy. After the energy is released, the 'empty' energy carriers return to the light-dependent reactions to obtain more energy. Section Summary "", ""https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-wmopen-biology1/chapter/photosynthesis/\n\x1b[92m[8] Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light.\x1b[0m Organic pigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. Energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state. Energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. So retinal pigments can only 'see' (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. For the same reasons, plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation. "", 'https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-wmopen-biology1/chapter/photosynthesis/\n\x1b[92m[4] The pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight.\x1b[0m A photon strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. The energy travels to the reaction center that contains chlorophyll a to the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior. This action builds up a high concentration of ions. The ions flow through ATP synthase via chemiosmosis to form molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy and reducing power carrier for the light-independent reactions.

Why do golfers shout fore? The RulesThe more modern-day Rules of Golf cover the need to shout ‘fore' as early as Section 1.2a: Conduct Expected of All Players. This states that players are expected to play in the spirit of the game by 'showing consideration to others.'For example, by playing at a prompt pace, looking out for the safety of others, and not distracting the play of another player. \x1b[92m[2] If a player plays a ball in a direction where there might be a danger of hitting someone, they should immediately shout a warning, such as the traditional\x1b[0m warning of 'fore'.However, it also states that 'there is no penalty under the Rules for failing to act in this way, except that the Committee may disqualify a player for acting contrary to the spirit of the game if it finds that the player has committed serious misconduct.'And herein lies a problem, you could say.

It was proven to be too much for Fanfiction.net, a site for fans to write stories based on the art they love, and James took her stories down. Luckily for fans, though, she had the opportunity to rewrite these stories and change some details. Then, of course, she published her work as Fifty Shades of Grey and became somewhat of a household name.

After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote Master of the Universe as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, and removed it from her website before publication. Meyer commented on the series, saying 'that's really not my genre, not my thing... Good on her – she's doing well. That's great!'

In its initial iteration, E.L. \x1b[92m[6] James’ 50 Shades of Gray was known as Master of the Universe, written by James using the online handle Snowqueen’s Icedragon, as a fan fiction version of Stephenie Meyers’ Twilight saga – with the lead male figure transformed from a 114 year old vampire into an all-too human billionaire.\x1b[0m (Fan fiction, for those not familiar with it, are stories written by fans of the original story, using various story lines, characters and settings, often with large amounts of sex thrown into the mix.) As Downes writes, 'Many write unique pieces only sharing the most basic elements, while others lift whole sections of the source material in order to create their own works. This is called, in copyright, ‘derivative works,’ and renders these pieces as the property of the original creative force.' This also means, according to Downes, that it is Meyers who has the power to give her approval (or not) for these works.

Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of the Customers table. When a primary key contains more than one field, it is usually composed of pre-existing fields that, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first name, and birth date as the primary key for a table about people. For more information, see adding or changing a table’s primary key.

The song was first recorded by Holiday in 1941 and has been covered by many artists since. \x1b[92m[0] The song became a sort of anthem of independence and self-reliance for many in the Black community.\x1b[0m It served as a counterpoint to Judy Garland’s Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which was popular at that time. There is a note of defiance and skepticism directed at established authorities – government, the church and even the family…. Rich relations give crusts of bread and suchYou can help yourself, but don’t take too much The message of the song seems to be: If you want to get by in this world, you’re going to have to take care of yourself – you’re on your own. Today’s lesson from the Gospel of Mathew is the Parable of the Talents (reprised in Luke’s Gospel as the Parable of the Minas). ', ""https://www.lyricslayers.com/billie-holiday/175917/\nBillie Holiday's 'God Bless The Child' is a poignant song that delves into themes of self-reliance and the harsh realities of economic disparity. The lyrics reflect a conversation about the importance of having one's own means in a world where wealth and social status can dictate one's opportunities and friendships. The opening lines, 'Them that's got shall have / Them that's not shall lose,' echo the biblical sentiment of the rich getting richer while the poor get poorer, a commentary on the unforgiving nature of society's distribution of wealth.The song further explores the fickle nature of relationships based on financial status. Holiday sings about how money attracts many friends, but these relationships are often superficial and disappear once the wealth is gone. This is a stark reminder of the value of genuine connections that are not influenced by material possessions. \x1b[92m[1] The repeated lines, 'Mama may have, Papa may have / But God bless the child that's got his own,' serve as a powerful refrain, emphasizing the blessing and strength found in self-sufficiency and not relying on others for one's well-being.Billie Holiday's performance of the song, with her emotive and soulful voice, adds depth to the message, making it resonate with listeners across generations.\x1b[0m The song is not just a reflection on economic inequality but also an anthem of empowerment, encouraging individuals to strive for personal independence and to take control of their own destiny, regardless of their circumstances.

344,"['https://byjus.com/chemistry/precipitation-reaction/\nMany chemical reactions occur in our daily lives. Common examples of such reactions are burning, corrosion, cooking of food and digestion. One important class of chemical reactions are precipitation reactions. In such reactions, two different soluble salts (which are in aqueous solutions) combine to form two products. \x1b[92m[7] One of these products is insoluble in the solution and is precipitated out (and is, therefore, referred to as the ‘precipitate’).\x1b[0m Precipitation Reaction – Definition and Meaning ', 'https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Main_Group_Reactions/Reactions_in_Aqueous_Solutions/Precipitation_Reactions\n\x1b[92m[4] Precipitates are insoluble ionic solid products of a reaction, formed when certain cations and anions combine in an aqueous solution.\x1b[0m The determining factors of the formation of a precipitate can vary. Some reactions depend on temperature, such as solutions used for buffers, whereas others are dependent only on solution concentration. The solids produced in precipitate reactions are crystalline solids, and can be suspended throughout the liquid or fall to the bottom of the solution. The remaining fluid is called supernatant liquid. The two components of the mixture (precipitate and supernate) can be separated by various methods, such as filtration, centrifuging, or decanting. Figure 1: Above is a diagram of the formation of a precipitate in solution. Precipitation and Double Replacement Reactions ', 'https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/igcse/chemistry/how-do-precipitate-formations-indicate-chemical-changes\n\x1b[92m[3] ArticleHow do precipitate formations indicate chemical changes?Precipitate formations indicate chemical changes by showing that a new substance has been created in a reaction.In chemistry, a precipitate is a solid that forms in a solution during a chemical reaction.\x1b[0m This process is known as precipitation. When two solutions are mixed together, if a chemical reaction occurs, it often results in the formation of a new substance. This new substance can be a gas, a different solution, or a solid. \x1b[92m[10] When a solid is formed, it is called a precipitate.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[8] The formation of a precipitate is a clear sign that a chemical change has taken place.The formation of a precipitate is a result of a specific type of chemical reaction called a precipitation reaction.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[1] In a precipitation reaction, two soluble reactants combine to form an insoluble product, the precipitate.\x1b[0m This precipitate will often settle at the bottom of the reaction vessel or float to the top, depending on its density relative to the solution. For example, if you mix solutions of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl), a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) forms. The equation for this reaction is AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO3. The silver chloride is the precipitate, and its formation indicates that a chemical change has occurred.Precipitation reactions are important in many areas of chemistry, including analytical chemistry, where they are used to identify the presence of certain ions in a solution. By observing the formation of a precipitate, chemists can infer that a chemical reaction has taken place, and use this information to identify the substances involved in the reaction.In conclusion, the formation of a precipitate is a clear visual indicator of a chemical change. It shows that a new substance has been created as a result of a chemical reaction, providing evidence of a chemical change.Answered by Till - University of Cambridge: Master’s in Chemical Engineering ', 'https://www.vaia.com/en-us/textbooks/chemistry/chemistry-matter-and-change-2007-edition/chapter-9/problem-78-under-what-conditions-does-a-precipitate-form-in-/\n\x1b[92m[0] A precipitate forms in a chemical reaction when an insoluble solid is produced due to the interaction between two or more soluble reactants.\x1b[0m This occurs when a double displacement reaction takes place and at least one insoluble product is formed according to the solubility rules. Factors like temperature, concentration, and pressure can also affect precipitation. Step by step solution 01 Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction Write down a balanced chemical equation involving the reactants provided in the problem. 02 Determine the solubility of the reactants and products Consult a solubility chart to determine which of the reactants and products are soluble or insoluble in water. 03 Identify if a double displacement reaction occurs Analyze the chemical equation to see if a double displacement reaction takes place, in which the ions from two different compounds exchange places, potentially forming a precipitate. 04 Apply the solubility rules ', 'https://www.toppr.com/guides/chemistry/solutions/precipitation-reaction-definition-and-examples/\n\x1b[92m[5] A precipitation reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs in aqueous solution and form precipitates.\x1b[0m Further, chemical reactions consist of chemical changes that take place within the substances. Thus, it gives rise to a new element under some particular conditions. Moreover, chemical reactions occur between two or more chemical compounds that we refer to as reactants. Thus, the reactants can be in forms of solid, gas or liquid. What is Precipitation Reaction? It means the chemical reaction occurs in aqueous solutions where two ions bond together to form insoluble salts. These insoluble salts formed are precipitates that are the products of it. They can be single displacement reactions or double displacement reactions. In a double displacement reaction, both ionic reactants dissociate in water and their ions bonds with the respective cation or anion from the other reactant. ', 'https://byjus.com/chemistry/precipitation-reaction/\nThe formation of a precipitate also suggests the presence of a chemical reaction. When a silver nitrate solution is poured into a sodium chloride solution, a chemical reaction occurs, producing a white silver chloride precipitate. Q3 What is an example of formation of precipitate? When a silver nitrate solution is poured into a sodium chloride solution, a chemical reaction occurs, producing a white silver chloride precipitate. A yellow lead(II) iodide precipitate is formed when the potassium iodide solution reacts with the lead(II) nitrate solution. Q4 Is Salt a precipitate? \x1b[92m[2] The insoluble salt falling out of the solution is referred to as the precipitate, hence the name of the reaction.\x1b[0m Precipitation reactions in the solution can help determine the identity of different ions. Q5 What factors affect precipitation? ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)\n\x1b[92m[9] In an aqueous solution, precipitation is the 'sedimentation of a solid material (a precipitate) from a liquid solution'.\x1b[0m The solid formed is called the precipitate. In case of an inorganic chemical reaction leading to precipitation, the chemical reagent causing the solid to form is called the precipitant. The clear liquid remaining above the precipitated or the centrifuged solid phase is also called the supernate or supernatant. The notion of precipitation can also be extended to other domains of chemistry (organic chemistry and biochemistry) and even be applied to the solid phases (e.g. metallurgy and alloys) when solid impurities segregate from a solid phase. Supersaturation Main article: Supersaturation The precipitation of a compound may occur when its concentration exceeds its solubility. This can be due to temperature changes, solvent evaporation, or by mixing solvents. Precipitation occurs more rapidly from a strongly supersaturated solution. "", ""https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/backgrounders/evidence-chemical-change\nIn some chemical reactions, the gas produced can be highly toxic.

Instead, we can observe a solid that is distinct and separate from the solution. We call this solid a precipitate. You have probably heard the word 'precipitation', but maybe not when talking about chemistry. We also use the word precipitation to refer to the types of water that fall from the sky. The solid in a precipitation reaction also often falls, or sinks, to the bottom of the solution. Precipitation reactions are all double replacement reactions.

The song was written by Kygo, Gomez, Brian Lee, Ali Tamposi, and Andrew Watt and produced by Kygo, Watt and Louis Bell. An EDM, dance-pop, electropop and tropical house song, 'It Ain't Me' comprises an acoustic guitar line, and a build-drop arrangement in its chorus featuring pulsing piano notes, bass, synthesizers, finger-snap claps and pan flute melodies. Gomez sings the track in a husky tone, while in the chorus her vocals are reduced to recurring syllables. The lyrics narrate a past relationship ruined by alcoholism.

In middle and high school, many teachers 👨\u200d🏫 required students to use this intricate notetaking method, reviewed them for a grade, and docked off points for criteria like organization. There's no wonder why so many people despise Cornell notes 😡. In reality, however, they're not that terrible. \x1b[92m[0] Cornell notes efficiently organize key points and questions for lectures, allow for in-depth notes and commentary 📄, and provide broad overviews of a lesson with a summary section.\x1b[0m Nowadays, many students use computers to type up their notes because it's so efficient; typing is much faster than writing by hand ✍. Taking notes the old-fashioned way, though, has an advantage. When we write by hand, our brain 🧠 remembers the content we wrote more than we would by typing because of the amount of energy it took.

This post outlines a four-step process, emphasizing taking notes in class, summarizing, and reviewing notes for optimal understanding.The Cornell format includes a header section, a summary section, a main notetaking section, and a cue section.  We’ve provided some practical tips, such as using short sentences, abbreviations, and symbols for efficient notetaking. The method's benefits include focused learning, easy notetaking, clear and structured notes, and enhanced skimming ability.However, there are some drawbacks, such as the challenge of paraphrasing in real-time and the necessity of working within the method's structured framework. It is recommended that when using the Cornell Method of notetaking you complete the cue and summary sections soon after lectures to maximize recall benefits. Overall, the Cornell Method proves beneficial for lectures, independent study, and group sessions, offering a clear structure for effective learning and retention.

And so, on 31 May 1939, the town of Cannes and the government signalled the official birth of the International Film Festival, a mere three months before the event’s inauguration date. The ‘Pearl of the Riviera’, a jewel on a coastline often compared with California, began to dream of Hollywood.

Consider splitting content into sub-articles, condensing it, or adding subheadings. Please discuss this issue on the article's talk page. \x1b[92m[1] (November 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this message) In the Germanic languages, a strong verb is a verb that marks its past tense by means of changes to the stem vowel.\x1b[0m The majority of the remaining verbs form the past tense by means of a dental suffix, are known as weak verbs, and outnumber strong verbs. "", 'https://blogs.transparent.com/german/weak-verbs-in-german/\nWeak Verbs in German Posted by Sandra Rösner on May 7, 2012 in Language In German, there are two basic forms of verbs: weak verbs and strong verbs. Weak verbs or regular verbs are those that follow a set pattern of rules and retain the same stem vowel throughout. These verbs are called weak verbs because you might think of them as being simply too weak to alter the patterns they follow – when they are conjugated. \x1b[92m[0] Strong verbs, on the other hand, do not follow a set pattern of conjugation, that is, the stem vowel will change when you, for example, form the past form of a strong verb.\x1b[0m When you are a native speaker of English you have already come across strong and weak verbs in your mother language. As mentioned above, German weak verbs are nothing else than English regular verbs (e.g. walk-walked-walked), and German strong verbs are nothing else than English irregular verbs (go-went-gone), so to speak. ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_strong_verb\nAs well as developing the strong verb system, Germanic also went on to develop two other classes of verbs: the weak verbs and a third, much smaller, class known as the preterite-present verbs, which are continued in the English auxiliary verbs, e.g. can/could, shall/should, may/might, must. Weak verbs originally derived from other types of word in PIE and originally occurred only in the present aspect. They did not have a perfect aspect, meaning that they came to lack a past tense in Germanic once the perfect had become the past[clarification needed]. Not having a past tense at all, they obviously also had no vowel alternations between present and past. To compensate for this, a new type of past tense was eventually created for these verbs by adding a -d- or -t- suffix to the stem. \x1b[92m[2] This is why only strong verbs have vowel alternations: their past tense forms descend from the original PIE perfect aspect, while the past tense forms of weak verbs were created later.\x1b[0m ']",how many strong verbs are there in german,"In the German language, there are approximately 200 strong verbs. These verbs undergo a vowel change in their stem when conjugated in the past tense, unlike weak verbs [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.","In the German language, there are approximately 200 strong verbs.

Just tell them to tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree.\x1b[92m[2] '– Penne Laingen The yellow ribbon refers to a popular song, 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,' written in 1972 and released in 1973 by the group Tony Orlando and Dawn.\x1b[0m It became a hit. Many artists subsequently covered the song, from Frank Sinatra to Dolly Parton. While the song itself has nothing to do with being taken hostage, it was a familiar tune that reminded the public of the hope and anticipation of welcoming a loved one home. After Penne Laingen’s suggestion in the interview, the yellow ribbon started to spread. It began with the other hostages’ families, and by the end of the crisis had become a cultural phenomenon. Penne Laingen was even asked to tie a yellow ribbon around the National Christmas Tree outside of the White House.

You say the name and it just reeks of avocado shag and Love’s Baby Soft. But what always struck me was the fact that this anonymous studio concoction, whose members weren’t even fully formed until after their first few hits, became such a visual presence and representation of the 70s. \x1b[92m[5] In fact, Tony Orlando & Dawn wasn’t even used until after seven Top 40 hits and two #1 song were racked up, including their biggest, Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree.\x1b[0m They actually had as many hits with their iconic name than without. I don’t think Tony Orlando minds at all because without this weird run of luck, he would have just been a guy who had a Top 20 hit called Bless You, way back in 1961.

In it, he substituted a yellow handkerchief for the white ribbon and an oak tree for the apple tree. Reader’s Digest reprinted Hamill’s story in 1972, and ABC-TV rushed out a feature starring James Earl Jones as the ex-con. \x1b[92m[1] The following year, Tony Orlando and Dawn released a smash hit with 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree.'\x1b[0m It’s hard to exaggerate just how popular this song was. Radio stations played it several times a day, every day, for months. It topped the charts in eight countries. And it hit with multiple generations, not just youth. I distinctly remember older aunts and uncles singing it when I was kid. Pete Hamill sued the songwriters, Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown, for copyright infringement. To no avail. The story wasn’t Hamill’s. It belonged to our collective folkloric imagination.

In the John Wayne film She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), a woman sported yellow to express her devotion to a cavalry officer. But there's no record of yellow ribbons appearing during the Korean War, the Vietnam War or any other conflict pre-1980.

He wrote his love, asking her to tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree in front of the house if she wanted him back. He asked the bus driver to look, as he feared there would be no ribbon. Bus passengers cheered after seeing 100 yellow ribbons tied around the tree. A woman told me that she’d tied a yellow ribbon around an old oak tree in her yard in the 1970s. A squirrel swiped the ribbon and tied it around an old squirrel nest. Chickadee chat Research showed that a chickadee’s brain grows up to 30 percent larger during times when they need to find food for caching. The brain expands, adding new nerve cells to help it remember where it had stored food. In the spring, when memory is less important, the brain shrinks to normal size.

He turned out to be very welcome: There were a hundred yellow ribbons.

411,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fool_on_the_Hill\n'The Fool on the Hill' is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 EP and album Magical Mystery Tour. It was written and sung by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. \x1b[92m[1] The lyrics describe the titular 'fool', a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise\x1b[0m. McCartney said the idea for the song was inspired by the Dutch design collective the Fool, who derived their name from the tarot card of the same name, and possibly by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The song's segment in the Magical Mystery Tour television film was shot separately from the rest of the film and without the other Beatles' knowledge. Accompanied by a professional cameraman, McCartney filmed the scene near Nice in France. In 1968, Sérgio Mendes & Brasil '66 recorded a cover version of the song that reached the top ten in the US. By the late 1970s, 'The Fool on the Hill' was one of McCartney's most widely recorded ballads. A solo demo and an outtake of the song were included on the Beatles' 1996 compilation album Anthology 2.

The cerebellum is situated posterior to the pons and forms part of the roof (tectum) of the forth ventricle. The pons contains nuclei that receive axons from various cortical areas. Projections from the axons of these pontine neurons form large transverse fiber bundles that traverse the pons and ascend to the contralateral cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncles. Also, within the pons base and tegmentum are longitudinally ascending and descending fibers. The nuclei of the 5th (trigeminal), 6th (abducens), 7th (facial) and the 8th (vestibulocochlear) nerves are located in the pons tegmentum.

The spinal cord neuron (gray matter) form a central core taking a butterfly configuration that is surrounded by nerve fibers (white matter). In the left and right halves of the spinal cord, the gray matter is organized into a dorsal horn and ventral horn with the intermediate gray located between them. In the thoracic spinal cord, which is illustrated in this figure, a lateral horn extends laterally from the intermediate gray (Figure 1.17A). The spinal cord white matter is subdivided into the posterior white column, the anterior white column and the lateral white column. The anterior white commissure joins the two halves of the spinal cord and is located ventral to the intermediate gray. The dorsal root fibers enter the spinal cord at the dorsolateral sulcus and the fibers of the ventral root fibers exit the spinal cord in numerous fine bundles through the ventral funiculus (see Figure 1.5).

Tsetse \x1b[92m[1] can be distinguished from other large flies by two easily-observed features: Primarily, tsetse fold their wings over their abdomens completely when they are resting (so that one wing rests directly on top of the other); Secondly, tsetse also have a long proboscis, extending directly forward, which is attached by a distinct bulb to the bottom of their heads\x1b[0m. ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsetse_fly\nGlossina palpalis and G. morsitans from a 1920 lexicon Tsetse has \x1b[96m[2] an unusual life cycle\x1b[0m, which may be due to the richness of their blood food source. \x1b[96m[3] A female fertilizes only one egg at a time; she will retain each egg within her uterus, the offspring developing internally (during the first three larval stages), in an adaptation called adenotrophic viviparity\x1b[0m. During this time, the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance (secreted by a modified gland) in the uterus. In the third larval stage, the tsetse larvae leave the uterus and begin an independent life. The newly-birthed larvae crawl into the ground and develop a hard outer shell (called the puparial case), within which they complete their morphological transformations into adult flies. ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsetse_fly\nG. m. submorsitans — ~6% from various birds excluding ostrich Waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) are unmolested by Glossina because they produce volatiles which act as repellents. Waterbuck odor volatiles are under testing and development as repellents to protect livestock.:\u200aSuppl T1 Genetics The genome of Glossina morsitans was sequenced in 2014. Symbionts Tsetse flies have at least three bacterial symbionts. The primary symbiont is Wigglesworthia (Wigglesworthia glossinidia), which live within the fly's bacteriocytes. The second symbiont is Sodalis (Sodalis glossinidius) intercellularly or intracellularly, and the third is some kind of Wolbachia. Diseases The salivary gland hypertrophy virus causes abnormal bleeding in the lobes of the crop of G. m. centralis and G. m. morsitans.

It contains no blood supply of its own—which is why you can shave your skin and not cause any bleeding despite losing many cells in the process. Assuming, that is, you don’t nick your skin to deep, where the blood supply is actually found. The epidermis is itself divided into at least four separate parts. A fifth part is present in some areas of our body. In order from the deepest layer of the epidermis to the most superficial, these layers (strata) are the: Stratum basale Stratum spinosum Stratum granulosum Stratum lucidum Stratum corneum Skin overview: Skin layers, of both hairy and hairless skin. Stratum Basale Human skin: This image details the parts of the integumentary system. ', 'https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Biology/Human_Biology_(Wakim_and_Grewal)/13%3A_Integumentary_System/13.3%3A_Skin\nOnly on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, the next layer above the stratum granulosum is the stratum lucidum. This is a layer consisting of stacks of translucent, dead keratinocytes that provide extra protection to the underlying layers. Stratum Corneum The uppermost layer of the epidermis everywhere on the body is the stratum corneum. \x1b[92m[2] This layer is made of flat, hard, tightly packed dead keratinocytes that form a waterproof keratin barrier to protect the underlying layers of the epidermis.\x1b[0m Dead cells from this layer are constantly shed from the surface of the body. The shed cells are continually replaced by cells moving up from the lower layers of the epidermis. It takes a period of about 48 days for newly formed keratinocytes in the stratum basale to make their way to the top of the stratum corneum to replace shed cells. Functions of the Epidermis ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin\nThe epidermis contains no blood vessels, and cells in the deepest layers are nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air and to a far lesser degree by blood capillaries extending to the outer layers of the dermis. The main type of cells that make up the epidermis are Merkel cells, keratinocytes, with melanocytes and Langerhans cells also present. The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, and basale. Cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer. The daughter cells (see cell division) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off (desquamation). This process is called 'keratinization'. \x1b[92m[3] This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and pathogens out, making skin a natural barrier to infection.\x1b[0m "", 'https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Biology/Human_Biology_(Wakim_and_Grewal)/13%3A_Integumentary_System/13.3%3A_Skin\nThe epidermis is the outer of the two main layers of the skin, the inner layer being the dermis. It averages about 0.10 mm thick and is much thinner than the dermis. The epidermis is thinnest on the eyelids (0.05 mm) and thickest on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (1.50 mm). The epidermis covers almost the entire body surface. It is continuous with, but structurally distinct from, the mucous membranes that line the mouth, anus, urethra, and vagina. \x1b[92m[0] Structure of the Epidermis There are no blood vessels and very few nerve cells in the epidermis.\x1b[0m Without blood to bring epidermal cells oxygen and nutrients, the cells must absorb oxygen directly from the air and obtain nutrients via diffusion of fluids from the dermis below. However, as thin as it is, the epidermis still has a complex structure. It has a variety of cell types and multiple layers.

356,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_to_the_Max\n'Homer to the Max' is the thirteenth episode of the tenth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 7, 1999. In the episode, Homer discovers that a new television show, Police Cops, has a hero also named Homer Simpson. He is delighted with the positive attention he receives because of his name, but when the television character is rewritten from a hero to a bumbling idiot, he is mocked and taunted, so he changes his name to 'Max Power' to rid himself of the negative attention. Max gains new friends, and is forced into a protest to prevent a forest from being knocked down. In the end, he changes his name back to Homer Simpson. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Pete Michels. Since airing, it has received mixed reviews from television critics. Overall, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.5. Plot Following the pilot, however, the Homer Simpson character is rewritten as Lance's overweight and inept comic relief sidekick who mistakes the toys for guns program as 'guns for toys' and the police chief's insulin shipment for illegal drugs. He also spouts the mindless catchphrase 'Uh-oh! SpaghettiOs!', resulting in Homer being mocked by the people of Springfield. Humiliated, he appeals to the producers to change the character back, but they refuse, instead using Homer's plea and incompetent exit as material. Then, \x1b[92m[1] after unsuccessfully attempting to sue the company for improper usage of his old name, Homer legally changes his name to 'Max Power', the only correctly spelled or sensible name on the list he presented to the presiding judge\x1b[0m.

With his new identity comes a massive change in attitude, as Max is much more assertive and freewheeling than Homer was. While shopping at Costington's, Max meets a successful businessman named Trent Steel. Trent invites Max and the family to a garden party, despite Marge's reservations, where they meet many famous people, but Max finds out the party is an excuse to save a redwood forest from destruction. After travelling with the party guests to the forest, Max, Marge, and everyone else chain themselves to the trees to prevent the bulldozers from knocking them down. The Springfield police arrive and Eddie and Lou chase Max around his tree, trying to 'swab' him with mace. As Max rounds the tree, the chain cuts into it.

325,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year\nIn the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, almost every fourth year is a leap year. \x1b[92m[2] Each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28.\x1b[0m Adding one extra day in the calendar every 4 years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a tropical year by almost 6 hours. However, this correction is excessive and the Gregorian reform modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are. 1800 calendar, showing that February had only 28 days "", ""https://www.infoplease.com/calendars/months-seasons/leap-year-explained\nThe Gregorian calendar, which now serves as the standard calendar for civil use throughout the world, has both common years and leap years. A common year has 365 days and a leap year 366 days, with the extra— or intercalary— day designated as February 29. \x1b[92m[0] A leap year occurs every four years to help synchronize the calendar year with the solar year, or the length of time it takes to complete the Earth's orbit around the sun, which is about 365 days and a quarter of a day.\x1b[0m The length of the solar year, however, is slightly less than 365¼ days-by about 11 minutes. To compensate for this discrepancy, the leap year is omitted three times every four hundred years. In other words, a century year cannot be a leap year unless it is divisible by 400. Thus 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years. When Are Leap Years? "", ""https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/leap-year-explained\nThat surplus of 0.24 days might seem insignificant, but let it accumulate for a few centuries, and we’d find ourselves seriously out of sync with the seasons. 'Leap years, therefore, are essential to prevent this drift and maintain the alignment of our calendar with the Earth's journey around the Sun,' Kim says. \x1b[92m[1] undefined As 0.24 is approximately a quarter of a day, we add four of them together on 29 February in a leap year to keep in step.\x1b[0m Who invented leap years? This system of adding one day every four years was introduced by none other than the ancient leader of Rome, Julius Caesar, in the year 46 BC. Prior to this appropriately named Julian calendar, the Roman Empire had operated using a calendar with 355 days in a year. Instead of adding the occasional extra day, back then it was the job of the high priests in Rome to call a leap month whenever they felt things were getting out of phase. So, did the Julian system solve our calendar woes once and for all? Not exactly.

The song was written by Bob Thiele and George Weiss.Thiele was a producer for ABC Records, while Weiss was a songwriter who helped create the hit version of 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' among others. What is the song about? Louis Armstrong - What a wonderful world ( 1967 ) 'What a Wonderful World' is simply about appreciating the beauty of your surroundings.In the song, Louis sings of seeing various events and natural wonders that make him smile, while also perhaps lamenting the passage of time, noting: "", ""The legendary New Orleans singer and trumpeter Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong had been making records since 1923, but in 1967 he released 'What A Wonderful World,' which would become the biggest-selling song of his long and storied career. Though renowned as one of the pioneers of Dixieland-style jazz in the 1920s, Armstrong was no stranger to the pop charts in the 1960s, having topped Billboard’s Hot 100 with the Grammy-winning single, 'Hello Dolly,' in 1964. But 'What A Wonderful World' was very different from what he’d done before; a slow pop ballad that captured Armstrong in a rare reflective mood.

It was first recorded by Louis Armstrong and released in 1967 as a single. In April 1968, it topped the pop chart in the United Kingdom, but performed poorly in the United States because Larry Newton, the president of ABC Records, disliked the song and refused to promote it. After it was heard in the film Good Morning, Vietnam, it was reissued as a single in 1988, and rose to number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The song was written by Bob Thiele and George Weiss.Thiele was a producer for ABC Records, while Weiss was a songwriter who helped create the hit version of 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' among others. What is the song about? Louis Armstrong - What a wonderful world ( 1967 ) 'What a Wonderful World' is simply about appreciating the beauty of your surroundings.In the song, Louis sings of seeing various events and natural wonders that make him smile, while also perhaps lamenting the passage of time, noting: "", ""https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/what-a-wonderful-world-louis-armstrong/\nThe legendary New Orleans singer and trumpeter Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong had been making records since 1923, but in 1967 he released 'What A Wonderful World,' which would become the biggest-selling song of his long and storied career. Though renowned as one of the pioneers of Dixieland-style jazz in the 1920s, Armstrong was no stranger to the pop charts in the 1960s, having topped Billboard’s Hot 100 with the Grammy-winning single, 'Hello Dolly,' in 1964. But 'What A Wonderful World' was very different from what he’d done before; a slow pop ballad that captured Armstrong in a rare reflective mood. With his craggy, weathered voice, he sang a song of hope that seemed to resonate with people everywhere. What made his performance magnetic was its poignancy: it was as if Armstrong, who was in his twilight years and ailing from a heart condition, was taking one last, appreciative look at life and taking stock of the simple things that most people take for granted.

He decided to go in a more 'human direction' with her because she is raised away from her own species, in 'close mental contact' with a human. 'I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its own society, but I haven't had a chance to explore that. I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race.' Paolini made Saphira the 'best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud.'

They developed the ability to breathe fire as they matured. Their color varied from dragon to dragon, and some dragons could even be multi-colored[1] or have clear scales[2]. According to Brom, dragons could grow to be 'larger than a house'[3] and some older dragons could be confused with large hills.[3] They were connected to the land in strange ways, ways that sometimes even they could not control. This was shown when Saphira touched Zar'roc with her muzzle, causing it to ripple,[4] when she turned Brom's grave from sandstone to diamond, and when she repaired the Isidar Mithrim.

He thought Eragon's growth and maturation throughout the book 'sort of mirrored my own growing abilities as a writer and as a person, too. So it was a very personal choice for that book.' Eragon's dragon, Saphira, was imagined as 'the perfect friend' by Paolini. He decided to go in a more 'human direction' with her because she is raised away from her own species, in 'close mental contact' with a human. 'I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its own society, but I haven't had a chance to explore that. I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race.' Paolini made Saphira the 'best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud.' Saphira's blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini's own color-blindness.

While hunting, he sees a large explosion and finds a blue dragon egg in the rubble. Later on, a baby dragon hatches from the egg, and bonds with Eragon, giving him a silver mark on his hand. \x1b[96m[1] Eragon names the dragon Saphira, after a name the old village storyteller Brom mentions\x1b[0m. He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira escape and hide in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the farm is burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon and Saphira decide to hunt the Ra'zac, in vengeance. Brom insists on accompanying him and Saphira, and gives Eragon the sword Zar'roc. "", ""https://inheritance.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon\n7.1 Images from the Inheritance books 7.2 Images from the Eragon film 8 References Description[] The dragons of Alagaësia were carnivorous flying reptiles, with scales, sharp teeth, four legs, bat-like membraned wings and a tongue that was covered with hooked barbs. They developed the ability to breathe fire as they matured. Their color varied from dragon to dragon, and some dragons could even be multi-colored[1] or have clear scales[2]. According to Brom, dragons could grow to be 'larger than a house'[3] and some older dragons could be confused with large hills.[3] They were connected to the land in strange ways, ways that sometimes even they could not control. This was shown when Saphira touched Zar'roc with her muzzle, causing it to ripple,[4] when she turned Brom's grave from sandstone to diamond, and when she repaired the Isidar Mithrim.

Its range is confined to cold, boreal waters of the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. It is common in the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea, and in western Scandinavian waters south to Kattegat and Øresund. It may also drift into the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea (where it cannot breed due to the low salinity). Similar jellyfish – which may be the same species – are known to inhabit seas near Australia and New Zealand. The largest recorded specimen was measured off the coast of Massachusetts in 1865 and had a bell with a diameter of 210 centimetres (7 feet) and tentacles around 36.6 m (120 ft) long. Lion's mane jellyfish have been observed below 42°N latitude for some time in the larger bays of the East Coast of the United States. The lion's mane jellyfish uses its stinging tentacles to capture, pull in, and eat prey such as fish, zooplankton, sea creatures, and smaller jellyfish. Taxonomy \x1b[92m[1] Cyanea capillata\x1b[0m, expanding (top), contracting (bottom) The taxonomy of the Cyanea species is not fully agreed upon; some zoologists have suggested that all species within the genus should be treated as one.

Populations in the western Pacific around Japan are sometimes distinguished as Cyanea nozakii, or as a subspecies, C. c. nozakii. In 2015, Russian researchers announced a possible sister species, Cyanea tzetlinii found in the White Sea. Description Lion's mane jellyfish (\x1b[92m[1] Cyanea capillata\x1b[0m) are named for their showy, trailing tentacles reminiscent of a lion's mane. They can vary greatly in size: although capable of attaining a bell diameter of over 2 m (6 ft 7 in), those found in lower latitudes are normally smaller than their far northern counterparts, with a bell about 50 cm (20 in) in diameter.

""]",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion%27s_mane_jellyfish'],"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion%27s_mane_jellyfish\nThe lion's mane jellyfish (\x1b[92m[1] Cyanea capillata\x1b[0m), also known as the giant jellyfish, arctic red jellyfish, or the hair jelly, is one of the largest known species of jellyfish. Its range is confined to cold, boreal waters of the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. It is common in the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea, and in western Scandinavian waters south to Kattegat and Øresund. It may also drift into the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea (where it cannot breed due to the low salinity). Similar jellyfish – which may be the same species – are known to inhabit seas near Australia and New Zealand. The largest recorded specimen was measured off the coast of Massachusetts in 1865 and had a bell with a diameter of 210 centimetres (7 feet) and tentacles around 36.6 m (120 ft) long. Lion's mane jellyfish have been observed below 42°N latitude for some time in the larger bays of the East Coast of the United States. The lion's mane jellyfish uses its stinging tentacles to capture, pull in, and eat prey such as fish, zooplankton, sea creatures, and smaller jellyfish. Taxonomy \x1b[92m[1] Cyanea capillata\x1b[0m, expanding (top), contracting (bottom) The taxonomy of the Cyanea species is not fully agreed upon; some zoologists have suggested that all species within the genus should be treated as one. Two distinct taxa, however, occur together in at least the eastern North Atlantic, with the blue jellyfish (Cyanea lamarckii Péron & Lesueur, 1810) differing in color (blue, not red) and smaller size (10–20 cm [3+7⁄8–7+7⁄8 inches] diameter, rarely 35 cm [14 inches]). Populations in the western Pacific around Japan are sometimes distinguished as Cyanea nozakii, or as a subspecies, C. c. nozakii. In 2015, Russian researchers announced a possible sister species, Cyanea tzetlinii found in the White Sea. Description Lion's mane jellyfish (\x1b[92m[1] Cyanea capillata\x1b[0m) are named for their showy, trailing tentacles reminiscent of a lion's mane. They can vary greatly in size: although capable of attaining a bell diameter of over 2 m (6 ft 7 in), those found in lower latitudes are normally smaller than their far northern counterparts, with a bell about 50 cm (20 in) in diameter. Furthermore, larger specimens are typically further offshore than smaller ones. Juveniles are lighter orange or tan, very young lion's manes are occasionally colorless and adults are red and start to darken as they age.

But tilapia, a freshwater fish native to the warm, shallow waters of Africa, which was introduced to the Sea unintentionally, has thrived and proliferated in the absence of predators.  \x1b[92m[1] Though considered a freshwater species, tilapia show a degree of tolerance to saltwater conditions and have been able to persist in the increasingly saline environment.\x1b[0m  Even today, fishing is, supposedly, good around the lake, with no catch limits on tilapia. But all is not well with the ichthyofauna of the Salton Sea. ', 'https://saltonsea.com/about/faq/\nSoon after the Salton Sea formed in 1905 many types of fish were stocked into the Sea for sport and commercial fishing purposes. In fact the Sea was a major sport fishing destination for nearly 60 years. At the beginning, the Sea was not salty and would support many different types of fish. As the Sea reached salt levels similar to the ocean many ocean species were stocked into the Sea as well. The salinity has unfortunately reached a point where it is assumed that the only species of fish that presently inhabit the Sea are the algae eating tilapia, that were introduced into the All American Canal for algae control in the 1960s, and the endangered, indigenous pupfish. \x1b[92m[0] The tilapia have managed to adapt to the high salt levels however scientists believe that the salinity is reaching a tipping point where even the tilapia will soon have a massive die-off.\x1b[0m It was estimated in the 1990s that the Sea was home to millions of tilapia.

In fact, it was one of Tara's own decisions that ultimately allowed Gemma (played by Katey Sagal) to kill her in the first place. Tara's tragic Sons of Anarchy fate FX Tara spent most of her run on Sons of Anarchy torn between her love for Jax and her desire to separate herself (and her children) from the club. She expresses on more than one occasion her wish to leave Charming and tries multiple times to get Jax to leave the dangerous town with her.

298,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin\nViolins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it. Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed. Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial 'trade violins' coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker. Etymology The word 'violin' was first used in English in the 1570s.

Her name is a play on the word 'sapphire', due in part to her deep blue coloration. Fírnen was one of the eggs that was captured by Galbatorix. His didn't hatch until Arya, his bond, brought him to the Crags of Tael'neir when the war with the Empire had finished. He is a small green dragon and Saphira's mate.

(deceased, pre-series) Unnamed, or, He Whose Name Cannot Be Pronounced in any Language, a dragon (whose name 'cannot be pronounced in this language or any'), who brokered the peace treaty between the elves and dragns, after Du Fyrn Skulblaka, the Dragon War.

While hunting, he sees a large explosion and finds a blue dragon egg in the rubble. Later on, a baby dragon hatches from the egg, and bonds with Eragon, giving him a silver mark on his hand. \x1b[92m[2] Eragon names the dragon Saphira, after a name the old village storyteller Brom mentions.\x1b[0m He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira escape and hide in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the farm is burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon and Saphira decide to hunt the Ra'zac, in vengeance. Brom insists on accompanying him and Saphira, and gives Eragon the sword Zar'roc.

He raises the dragon in secret and pesters the local storyteller, Brom, with questions of the fabled dragon riders whenever he’s puzzled by the creature. \x1b[92m[0] He names the dragon Saphira, after learning of the name from Brom.\x1b[0m Saphira grows quickly and the two — dragon and Eragon — form a strong bond. They are able to communicate telepathically. However, Eragon’s idyllic affair with Saphira does not last. A pair of odd individuals visit the village asking about the stone and soon work their way to the farm where Eragon lives. They torture his uncle for answers on the whereabouts of the stone. Though Eragon tried to save his uncle by carrying him to the village to have his injuries nursed, his uncle passes away and Eragon leaves soon after in pursuit of the strangers. Brom accompanies him on the chase and informs him that the strangers are grotesque creatures called Ra’zac that are known for killing dragons. ', ""https://inheritancefanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Dragons\nIn the first book, when Eragon asked Brom about dragons and the Dragon Riders, he asked him what were the names of the former dragons before the fall of the order. \x1b[92m[1] Amongst them was Saphira, the name of Brom's former dragon.\x1b[0m Later, Eragon shares the list of names with her, and she chose Saphira.

Rather, the way the scene is filmed cuts short a sequence that feels like it should be much longer. Eragon’s relationship to Saphira is key to the entire film, so much of the first act should be devoted to him trying to keep her hidden, raising her, and learning what she’s like. It’s not the sort of event you want the film to rush through unless their relationship is supposed to be very different. \x1b[92m[5] It is a more antagonistic in the film, with Eragon initially blaming Saphira for his uncle’s death and struggling to bond with her for part of the film, but the difficulties in their relationship as dragon and rider aren’t the emotional focus so much as their love for one another, as in the book.\x1b[0m So the film’s a bit of a mess.

322,"[""https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/elections/types-of-elections.html\nIn presidential elections, each major political party holds a national convention where they choose their nominee for president. The results of the primary election determine how votes from Pennsylvania are cast at the convention. The nominees from each party run against each other in the general election in November. \x1b[92m[1] The president is officially elected by the Electoral College, not by popular vote.\x1b[0m But the popular vote – including your vote – helps determine which candidate receives Pennsylvania's electoral votes. About the Electoral College The U.S. Constitution created the Electoral College to ensure that each state has a role in selecting the president, no matter its population. Each state has the same number of electoral votes as it has members of Congress. There are a total of 538 votes in the Electoral College. A candidate must win a simple majority--270 electoral votes-- to win the election. "", ""https://votesmart.org/education/elections\nc. Runoff Primary - if no candidate gets a majority of the votes, a runoff is held to decide who should win. d. Presidential Primary - a primary used to pick delegates to the presidential nominating conventions of the major parties. \x1b[92m[0] Election Vocabulary Electoral College - A group of persons called 'electors,' selected by the voters in each state, that officially elects the president and vice president.\x1b[0m The number of electors in each states is equal to its number of representatives in both houses of Congress.

Office-Block Ballot "", 'https://ourwhitehouse.org/getting-the-votes-and-getting-elected-the-popular-vote-vs-the-electoral-college/\n\x1b[92m[3] When the delegates at the Constitutional Convention decided to create an Electoral College to choose the president, their vision for how this group would work was somewhat idealistic.\x1b[0m In their minds, electors would be educated and distinguished citizens of each state who would be free to consider each presidential candidate. They envisioned that the electors would carefully discuss the qualifications of each candidate and engage in vigorous debate before casting their votes and sending them to Congress. And in our country’s early elections the Electoral College did work this way because electors were chosen either by the state legislatures or by popular vote within each state. However, the development and rising power of political parties transformed this process from the Fathers’ idealistic vision. Over time, electors were no longer chosen for their distinction as citizens, but for their loyalty to a particular party. Today, electors are chosen at state party conventions or are appointed directly by party leaders. Each major party elects or appoints the same number of electors as the state has electoral votes. So, when the electors chosen in the November election meet in their respective state capitols in December, there is no vigorous debate about the presidential candidates’ qualifications—the electors simply vote for their party’s candidate.

The 23rd Amendment, ratified in 1961, assigns three additional electors to the District of Columbia, bringing the total number of electors to 538. To win, a presidential ticket must obtain a majority — 270 if all electors vote. Otherwise, the 12th Amendment provides that the House of Representatives chooses the president, with each state delegation receiving one vote, and the Senate chooses the vice president by majority vote.
