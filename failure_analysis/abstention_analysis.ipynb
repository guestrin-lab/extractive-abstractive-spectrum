      "Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) was a subject and core class taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[16][27] in which students studied and learnt how to defend themselves against all aspects of the Dark Arts, including dark creatures,[24][28][29] curses, hexes and jinxes (dark charms),[25] and duelling.[23] The position of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at the school was once rumoured to be jinxed, as no teacher could hold the post for more than a year without suffering an unpleasant fate. Tom Riddle jinxed the position because Albus Dumbledore did not give him the job when he applied for it.[4] The fact that no teacher has lasted longer than a year meant that the subject had numerous Professors over the years.[23] Ilvermorny began teaching the subject in the 17th century.[16] Harry Potter would occasionally deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts in his adulthood.[30] Contents \n",

      "Defence Against the Dark Arts was a required subject from first year to fifth year.[27][21] In this class, students learned how to cast offencive and protective spells, as well as how to properly handle and deal with dark creatures. The lessons generally had a practical approach, with competent teachers like Remus Lupin correctly believing that when it came to the Dark Arts, a practical approach was the best way,[24][25][23] with theoretical assignments given as homework.[31] Inadequate teachers, such as Quirinus Quirrell and Dolores Umbridge, who were focused on theories alone, hampered the learning of defences, as they would not be providing students any practical experiences.[21][32] \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, due to the course being directly related to the Dark Arts itself, Dark wizards who wished to teach would typically apply for this course, notable examples being Tom Riddle,[4] Patricia Rakepick,[40] Quirinus Quirrell,[41] Bartemius Crouch Junior,[10] Dolores Umbridge,[42] Severus Snape[12] and Amycus Carrow.[43] Jinx on the post[] The curriculum of the class varied greatly depending on what the professor at the time deemed appropriate. Due to the jinx on the teaching post that was present before Lord Voldemort died, many teachers had been appointed to this post, with none of them lasting for more than a single school year.[4] Tom Riddle twice applied for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position, the first time shortly after graduation from Hogwarts when he was turned down by Headmaster Armando Dippet, who claimed he was too young, but invited him to re-apply a few years later.[4] Earlier teachers from the 1985–1986 school year for example, were considered highly incompetent and ineffective by most students, and as such, very rarely showed up to teach.[44][45][46][47] Patricia Rakepick teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts to fifth-years During the 1988–1989 school year, the renowned Curse-Breaker Patricia Rakepick was appointed as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for that academic year.[5] She proved herself to be a highly effective teacher of both defensive and offensive magic, having taught her students a wide variety of fascinating and useful topics during her lessons, to compensate her students for having learnt almost nothing in previous years. She even gave her select students private lessons in the subject, teaching them how to duel, in preparation for locating the Cursed Vaults throughout the Castle.[5][48][49][50][51][52] [53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] Bill Weasley teaching a group of students DADA in the evening \n",

      "During the 1995–1996 school year, the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, had deluded himself with the bizarre conspiracy theory that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore was using the students to create a private army of young witches and wizards to overthrow the Ministry.[73] As such, he implanted Dolores Umbridge to become the teacher of the Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, which he believed to be the main source of training (e.g. defensive spells) for Dumbledore's would-be soldiers.[21] Umbridge 'teaching' Defence Against the Dark Arts \n",

      "When J. K. Rowling was asked why Dumbledore would not give Severus Snape the Defence Against the Dark Arts job, Rowling responded that Dumbledore believed that teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts would bring out Snape's worst side,[117] though Dumbledore finally relented in Harry's sixth year.[118] Snape feigned ignorance when questioned by Hogwarts High Inquisitor Umbridge about Dumbledore's reason for denying him the post,[119] but admitted it to Bellatrix Lestrange during their conversation in Spinner's End.[120] Rowling has also revealed that after Amycus Carrow was the Dark Arts teacher, a permanent teacher took the post because Voldemort's jinx over the job was lifted. \n",

      "each meets Harry before he arrives at Hogwarts in the respective year (with the exception of Mad-Eye Moody, who was only mentioned in passing, although Harry had unknowingly encountered Barty Crouch Jnr at the Quidditch World Cup) and each physically (or magically) attacks Harry during school term, either intentionally or accidentally, as in the case of Remus Lupin. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when discussing who their new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher would be, Harry said that the teachers didn't have much luck: 'One sacked, one dead, one lost his memory, and one was locked in a trunk for nine months,' referring to Lupin, Quirrell, Lockhart, and Moody, respectively; this isn't true, however, because Lupin resigned rather than was fired. Also, Crouch Jnr, the de facto teacher for Harry's fourth year, suffered the Dementor's Kiss. Quirinus Quirrell is the only Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher known to have died during the year he gave the subject. \n",

      "Defense Against the Dark Arts is one of the staple classes Hogwarts students attend throughout the Harry Potter series, and its rotating cast of professors makes it extra intriguing — here's every one of the Harry Potter Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers explained. The Harry Potter franchise has reached its penultimate success as the Wizarding World produces the Fantastic Beasts spinoff and the long-awaited video game Hogwarts Legacy. The class in question, also known as D.A.D.A., taught students to defend themselves against all kinds of dark magic, including curses, jinxes, and hexes. The curses weren't just limited to the classroom: the D.A.D.A. teaching position itself seemed cursed. No D.A.D.A. professor lasted in the role for longer than a year during Harry's time at Hogwarts. \n",
      "\n",
      "The final contestant on the Harry Potter Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers roster is Amycus Carrow. Amycus Carrow would have been Harry's seventh-year D.A.D.A. teacher had he attended Hogwarts in his final year. Even though Harry didn't experience Carrow's teaching in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2, many of his school friends still did, including Neville Longbottom. While Carrow was professor, he changed the name of the class from 'Defense Against the Dark Arts' to 'The Dark Arts,' the name reflecting the changed content. He and his sister Alecto were in charge of punishment at the school, so he often incorporated that aspect of his role into his teaching. Students in his class were made to practice the Cruciatus curse on students in detention, and if they refused to do so, as Neville did, they were also tortured. \n",

      "Gilderoy Lockhart In 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' noted celebrity wizard Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) makes his way to Hogwarts on the tails of a never-ending ego trip. Despite the mountains of magical memoirs penned in his name, Lockhart is all but incapable of defensive spells. And yet, no one is more convinced of his greatness than he is himself. This leads to one of the most satisfying scenes in the entire Harry Potter film series: the dueling club demonstration in which Snape absolutely decks Lockhart with a single spell. Quirinus Quirrell In 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,' professor Quirinus Quirrell (Ian Hart), Harry’s first Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, is unique in that, inadvertently or not, he is also the first teacher to try to kill him. And from what I can recall, the rest of his teaching was unremarkable. Dolores Umbridge \n",

      "Lt. Col. Mann and Gibbs join Abby, who is watching convenience store video and talking to the television.  Lt. Col. Mann wants to know if all of Gibbs’s people talk to themselves.  Abby is ideal for this job as she can read lips.  After watching an insane amount of video, Abby has zoned in on a fella named Abraham, who looks like the homeless guy that Sharif 'caught' stealing.  She reports that she saw him say, 'the day of judgment is coming.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Gibbs encourages Ziva to disclose what happened afterwards, and she reveals that she had gone to Saleem's camp alone to protect the surviving team members, who were both injured. She briefly describes the circumstances of her capture and admits that she did not intend to live through the ordeal. Gibbs gets up, whispers in her ear, and kisses her forehead, causing her to break down in relief. As the episode ends, Vance approves Ziva's application which results in Ziva becoming an NCIS Special Agent albeit a Probie. Production 'Good Cop, Bad Cop' is written by David North and Jesse Stern and directed by Leslie Libman. Flashbacks that are interspersed throughout the episode are set in various locations, including Jordan, the Red Sea, and Somalia. \n",
      "\n",
      "Initially rejected by most of the other characters, she is eventually accepted as a member of the NCIS team and as a surrogate daughter figure to team leader Gibbs (Mark Harmon). She also serves as a foil for Special Agent Tony DiNozzo, a former Baltimore homicide cop and 'wannabe playboy' played by Michael Weatherly. From early in Ziva's time on the show producers began to toy with the idea of pairing them romantically, but continued to place a number of obstacles in their way (namely difficult circumstances and other love interests). Ziva's upbringing is alluded in her first few seasons. She is depicted as having a somewhat troubled background with a difficult family history. Her younger sister was killed in a terrorist attack against Israel, and her half-brother Ari Haswari became a Hamas terrorist; she eventually kills him onscreen to prevent him from killing Gibbs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Back in Washington D.C., Tony starts to question Ziva's loyalty when she defends Rivkin's actions. In a confrontation between the two over Ziva's reluctance to tell Gibbs about her connection to Rivkin, Ziva asks if Tony's suspicions of Rivkin are fuelled by jealousy. It is made evident that Ziva is in a romantic relationship with Rivkin in the closing moments of Part II as the two are seen in bed together. \n",
      "\n",
      "The search and rescue of Ziva was written into the seventh season premiere, but rather than show her in captivity, the writers decided to script the episode from Tony's point of view. This allowed them to shock the audience by opening the episode with Tony strapped to the interrogation chair, rather than Ziva, as well as keep viewers wondering about Ziva's fate. Brennan relayed, 'You'll think you know what's going on, but then you'll go, 'Am I seeing things? What just happened?'' Within the episode, Tony, under the influence of truth serum, recounts to Saleem the events that occurred during the four months since Ziva's disappearance: the team at first attempted to replace Ziva without success. After becoming concerned about her continued lack of communication, they hacked into Mossad's database and learned that she had been put on the assignment to find and kill Saleem. Gibbs then informed them that the Damocles, the ship the Mossad team had taken, had sunk in a storm and that there were no survivors. Tony subsequently became despondent for some time until deciding that they needed to avenge Ziva's death by killing Saleem. This led to him and McGee intentionally being taken captive and interrogated upon locating the camp through the shipment of the fictional drink, 'Caf-Pow!'. In present day, he concludes that Ziva is 'not replaceable'. \n",
      "\n",
      "'The early episodes were a bit tense - he wanted to embrace her and bring her back into the fold but felt the need to be standoffish. Will he be someone she can trust, implicitly? Absolutely, without doubt. Will he ever be the warm and fuzzy big fluffy teddy bear in the corner? No, not a chance. At the end of the day, Gibbs is a realist.' —Mark Harmon on Gibbs and Ziva She becomes a suspect for the marine's death when Eli, in an attempt to prevent her from leaving Mossad, orders her former team leader, Malachi Ben Gidon, who had been on the mission with her, to accuse her of being responsible for the killing. After she is proven innocent, Gibbs angrily states that Ziva is 'off limits' to Eli. They reconcile, with Ziva relaying the rest of what happened up to being taken captive. Gibbs then whispers something in her ear and kisses her forehead as she breaks down crying. \n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, the subject is alluded to during specific cases, such as when the team deals with a rape victim at the end of Season 7 and an abused wife in the middle of Season 8. In the latter case, Head Medical Examiner Ducky Mallard (David McCallum) suggests that Gibbs have Ziva be the one to confront the woman, saying, 'Agent David has been through things you and I can't even imagine, and she knows what it's like to be controlled.' Michael Nouri was brought back to guest star as Eli David during the eighth season, and the consequences of his actions are addressed. Ziva is able to forgive him somewhat, and he tries to reach a full reconciliation in Season 10's 'Shabbat Shalom'. However, he is killed in a targeted shooting before he is able to make peace with his daughter, greatly devastating Ziva and prompting her to embark on a campaign of revenge against the man responsible: Ilan Bodnar. Use of torture Ziva's ordeal in Somalia included being tortured by Saleem and his men, but the producers avoided depicting it graphically. Shane Brennan wrote a cliffhanger for the season finale that briefly shows her in the aftermath of an evidently brutal interrogation; in it, she is limp and tied to a chair, bloody and bruised. Makeup specialists were able to use a significant amount of cosmetics on de Pablo to make her face 'nearly unrecognizable'. The torturer, later identified as Saleem, casually returns to her cell, rips off her Star of David pendant, and demands that she tell him what she knows about NCIS. She does not appear again until her rescue in the Season 7 premiere, where she is hooded, 'ready to die', and unable to walk on her own. \n",
      "\n",
      "The actor joined the cast of 'NCIS' during Season 3, portraying Ziva David, a daring Mossad agent who eventually goes to work for Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Harmon) full-time. Over the years, she became an integral part of the team and a sort of daughter figure to Gibbs himself. That relationship became a major point of narrative interest for fans, in no small part because Harmon and de Pablo displayed incredible onscreen chemistry during the almost 200 episodes they worked together on the show. And yes, it was well on display during a Season 7 scene in which Gibbs leans in to whisper something into Ziva's ear. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for that Season 7 whisper, it came upon Ziva David's surprising return from a shocking Season 6 twist. And it drew further intrigue among many not only because the words are muted, but also because it's a touch more paternally intimate than we'd generally seen from Gibbs — even in regards to Ziva David. As it was, 'NCIS' fans were no doubt bummed Mark Harmon wouldn't reveal what was said. They were likely even more so when he revealed he was speaking to his co-star out of character. \n",

      "Historically, the early Anglo-Protestant settlers in the seventeenth century were the most successful group, culturally, economically, and politically, and they maintained their dominance till the early twentieth century. Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families, such as Boston Brahmin, First Families of Virginia, Old Philadelphians, Tidewater, and Lowcountry gentry or old money, were WASPs. Commitment to the ideals of the Enlightenment meant that they sought to assimilate newcomers from outside of the British Isles, but few were interested in adopting a Pan-European identity for the nation, much less turning it into a global melting pot. However, in the early 1900s, liberal progressives and modernists began promoting more inclusive ideals for what the national identity of the United States should be. While the more traditionalist segments of society continued to maintain their Anglo-Protestant ethnocultural traditions, universalism and cosmopolitanism started gaining favor among the elites. These ideals became institutionalized after the Second World War, and ethnic minorities started moving towards institutional parity with the once dominant Anglo-Protestants. \n",
      "\n",
      "The late 19th century saw the creation of a modern industrial economy. A national transportation and communication network was created, the corporation became the dominant form of business organization, and a managerial revolution transformed business operations. An era of intense partisanship, the Gilded Age was also an era of reform. The Civil Service Act sought to curb government corruption by requiring applicants for certain governmental jobs to take a competitive examination. The Interstate Commerce Act sought to end discrimination by railroads against small shippers and the Sherman Antitrust Act outlawed business monopolies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Much has been written about the enmity and suspicion that existed between the Russian and the Spanish-Mexican authorities in California, but their disagreements have been overstated. The Spanish government officially forbade its subjects from trading with foreigners. Commercial exchanges, however, did take place between the Spanish and the Russians beginning with Rezanov’s visit, and, in the early days of Ross, the Californios supplied the Russians with their first wheat, fruit trees, cattle, and horses. Because the Californios undertook almost no manufacturing of their own, they had considerable demand for farm implements and household wares. As the Russian colony grew, it was soon able to fulfill some of this demand. There was hardly a useful item of wood, metal, or leather that the promyshlenniki and artisans did not produce, and soon the Russians sold ploughs, axes, nails, wheels, metal cookware and longboats to their neighbors in exchange for grain, salt, and other raw materials. After Mexico won her independence from Spain in 1821, foreign trade was no longer against the law. Trade between the Californios and the Russians continued, but now there was more competition from the Americans and British. Competition lowered the price of Russian goods and increased the price of California produce. Trade relations were further hampered by the Mexican imposition of new anchorage fees on all foreign vessels entering California ports. One compensation for the Russians, however, was their control of Bodega Bay, their main shipping port. Here they had established storage and supply facilities as well as landing rights, all made available to foreign vessels. Here some supplies were warehoused and others taken to Fort Ross by baidara and baidarka or by horseback. The journey between the port facilities at Bodega Bay and Fort Ross usually took five hours, whether by land or by sea. With this port of entry and with their variety of goods for sale, the Russians were able to continue trading with the Californios, as evidenced, for example, by the records of the sale of gunpowder and uniforms, procured or produced by the Russians, to General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, on the nearby Mexican frontier. \n",
      "\n",
      "On these and other expeditions, Voznesenskii was able to gather an ethnographically invaluable collection of California Indian artifacts. These include ornaments, weapons, garments and baskets that can be seen today at the Museum of Ethnography, St. Petersburg, Russia. Many of these objects are the sole surviving items of their kind. Voznesenskii’s travel notes tell of his many local excursions, from the islands of San Francisco Bay to the forests of the Mendocino Coast. They contain observations of the lives of Californians, from the children at Fort Ross to the foreign merchants at Yerba Buena (San Francisco). The Last Years of the Russian Colony At the same time, the Mexican government’s active encouragement of new settlers into the area, as well as a growing influx of Americans, posed a looming challenge to Russian claims over territory, which neither the Imperial government in distant St. Petersburg nor the Russian-American Company was able to meet. A last effort to avert a Russian withdrawal came in 1836 when Baron von Wrangell journeyed from Sitka to Mexico City to seek an improvement in relations with the new Mexican Republic. He also sought Mexico’s formal recognition of the legality of Russia’s claim to Fort Ross, previously denied by both Spain and Mexico. The Mexicans were willing to yield on this issue, but only in return for Russia’s diplomatic recognition of their own national independence as a republic. However, Tsar Nicholas I, an unwavering defender of absolute monarchy and a foe of revolutionary change, rejected the condition, and so ended any chance of a favorable resolution of the contested issue of the 'legitimacy' of the Russian colony. In April 1839, the Tsar approved of the Company’s plan to liquidate the settlement, and shortly thereafter the Company offered all of its California holdings for sale. \n",

      "On January 1, 1842, Rotchev and about one hundred colonists sailed from Bodega Bay on the last Russian ship bound for Sitka. After 30 years, the flag of the Russian-American Company was lowered at Fort Ross, and the Russian epoch in the history of California came to a close. Russia’s California Outpost in Historical Perspective The venture of the Russian-American Company into California was short-lived. However, the memory of it has lingered long, preserved in the buildings and the stockade at Fort Ross, both original and restored, in the place names of scattered creeks and coves along the northern coast and of the largest river in Sonoma County, and in the vestiges of Russian and Native Alaskan influence on the Kashaya Pomo language and culture. The Russians were the first to explore and map parts of Northern California, and they were also the first known Europeans to climb Mt. St. Helena. \n",

      "Throughout California, Indigenous nations have used fire for thousands of years as a tool to steward the land, and still do today. When Europeans colonized California, they found a garden of redwoods and other lands. Evidence of this stewardship can still be seen on the trees at Muir Woods. Fire scars tell the story of Indigenous cultural burns set by the first stewards of Muir Woods, the Coast Miwok. Cultural burns passed down through generations have benefited both land and people, by improving soil quality, and spurring growth of certain plant species, creating a healthy and resilient landscape. \n",

      "You may not think of California when you think of the Civil War, but the war deeply divided Californians as it did the rest of the country. Secessionists dominated the Southern half of the state, while Northern California remained predominately pro-Union. Even before the war began, California played an important role in the fight over slavery, as events here helped to set the stage for war. The financial prowess of the state's rich gold mines and pro-Union business elite would ensure the success of the Northern war effort by keeping it well-funded. Without this steady supply of gold, the outcome of the war might have been very different. Addditionally, California led the nation in contributions to the United States Sanitary Commission, which was the primary organization responsible for the medical treatment of the many military casualties suffered on the Union side. Like other Northern states, California supplied thousands of soldiers for the Union war effort; California troops were responsible for pushing the Confederate Army out of Arizona and New Mexico in 1862. Additionally, numerous California regiments were organized and joined with state regiments back east. Californians would face the enemy in most of the major battles in the East, including one regiment, organized and commanded by the former California Senator Edward Dickinson Baker (then a Colonel), that defended against Pickett's charge at Gettysburg, arguably the most pivotal military action of the war. In all, over 17,000 Californians would join as soldiers; this is the highest per-capita total for any state in the Union. California in Time: the Fight over Slavery Through the Civil War \n",

      "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein opens and we’re in London, where Larry Talbot paces nervously about a hotel room.  He paces over to the telephone and asks the operator if his call to the States has been completed yet.  Clearly, this is an urgent call.  He’s passed through.  On the other end, in Florida, an employee of an express package delivery station answers the call, Wilbur (Costello).  Talbot asks him if two crates to be delivered to the McDougal’s House of Horrors have been received.  Wilbur’s clueless so Talbot urgently explains that the two crates are not to be delivered to the House of Horrors under any circumstance until he arrives.  While explaining, however, the full moon rises and Talbot turns into the wolf man.  Call ends.

      "In the midst of the World Series, Abbott and Costello appeared on 'The Steve Allen Show' on Oct. 7, 1956. The weekly NBC-TV variety hour aired live on Sunday night at 8 p.m. ET. This particular episode was a 'Salute to Baseball' with special guests Mickey Mantle and Claire Ruth, Babe Ruth’s widow, as well as musician Lionel Hampton, singer Peggy King, and puppet act Kukla, Fran and Ollie. After interviews with Mrs. Ruth, who said she 'surely' hopes that Mantle will break the Bambino’s single-season homer record of 60, and Mantle, who that afternoon hit a tremendous sixth-inning home run of Brooklyn’s Ed Roebuck in Game 4 of the Fall Classic to lead New York to a 6-2 win at Yankee Stadium, it was time for Allen to introduce the famed comedy duo to the audience.

      "'Who's on First?' is Abbott and Costello's signature routine. Time magazine (December 26, 1999) named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century. The sketch was based on other earlier burlesque wordplay routines. They began honing the routine shortly after teaming up in 1936, and performed it in vaudeville in 1937 and 1938. It was first heard by a national radio audience on March 24, 1938, when the team were regulars on the Kate Smith radio show. By then, John Grant had been writing or adapting other sketches for the team and may have helped expand 'Who's on First?' prior to its radio debut. He stayed on as their head writer into the 1950s. Depending upon the version, Abbott has either organized a new baseball team and the players have nicknames, or he points out the proliferation of nicknames in baseball (citing St. Louis Cardinals sibling pitchers Dizzy and Daffy Dean) before launching into the routine. The infielders' nicknames are Who (first base), What (second base) and I Don't Know (third base). The key to the routine is Costello's mounting frustration set against Abbott's unyielding formality. Audio recordings are readily available on the Internet. A notable version is the first television performance on the 1951 Colgate Comedy Hour. Abbott and Costello performing 'Who's on First?' \n",

      "The comedy group The Credibility Gap performed a rock and roll update of 'Who's on First?' using the names of rock groups The Who, The Guess Who, and Yes, recorded and released on their first album, The Bronze Age of Radio. On the January 13, 2001, episode of Saturday Night Live host Charlie Sheen and SNL cast-member Rachel Dratch performed a modified version of 'Who's on First?' in a sketch. NBC's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2006), a drama about life backstage at a television comedy series, used 'Who's on First?' as a plot device. A TV movie called Bud and Lou, based on a book by Hollywood correspondent Bob Thomas, was broadcast in 1978. Starring Harvey Korman as Bud Abbott and Buddy Hackett as Lou Costello, the film told the duo's life story, focusing on Costello and portraying him as volatile and petty. \n",

      "In 2015, a non-profit fan film was produced titled Abbott & Costello Meet Superman. The film was screened at the Superman Celebration Film Festival in Metropolis Illinois and is currently streaming on YouTube. Abbott and Costello are played by two actors from New York, Aaron M. Lambert and Jake Navatka. In the 2016 sci-fi movie Arrival, the two Heptapods (alien beings) are named Abbott and Costello by the scientists, because the one named Abbott is taller and quieter while the one named Costello is shorter and chattier. The names also have extra-diegetic significance as two of the main themes in the movie are linguistics and (mis)communication, which mirrors themes of the 'Who's on First?' routine.

      "I’d heard about Abbott and Costello Go To Mars for many years but didn’t see it until I got a sweet deal on an Abbott and Costello 3-dvd package. I watched it for the first time right after Carnival 2023 but opted to wait until it was still seasonal. Seasonal? Read on, gentle readers. The premise is outlandish. The boys, as they were always called even when they were in their mid-Forties. find themselves on a space ship that accidentally launches. Their first landing is just outside New Orleans during Carnival. The boys think they’ve landed on Mars. I’m skipping the crime subplot altogether. Suffice it to say that Bud and Lou meet their evil twins who rob a bank while clad in space suits. The costume designers at Universal Pictures had a great time with this movie. I understand they had some local help as well. Dig these images: Here’s Lou Costello with a bowhead. Stilt-walkers are still around in modern Carnival but not as ubiquitous as in the 1950’s: \n",

      "This Abbott and Costello movie was a departure from their norm. Bud plays a dual role as the number two man in a large vacuum cleaner company with offices all over and also he plays a cousin exiled to Stockton with impossible quotas, both are pretty straight ones. Lou gets the funny man role as usual. He plays a farm boy who has taken a mail order course by records no less on being a salesman. He goes to the big city to try and get a job, screws it up and gets sent to the Stockton branch. Here he gets fooled in to believing he can read minds, goes out and breaks the all time one day sales record by selling nine cleaners. Meanwhile Bud in his main role has been keeping not only double books but skimming off the profits into a secret account. Then at a company meeting Lou finds out the mind reading thing was all a hoax, so he goes back home only to find the company president and some others waiting. They want to hire him as the regional sales manager for his local area and so all ends well. Oh yeah he also gets the girl. \n",

      "Abbott and Costello star in 'Little Giant', and it's got some of their usual stuff, but they don't appear as a team in this movie. Lou is a sap hoping to make his way in the business world, only to repeatedly run into trouble in the process. Bud appears in dual roles, playing the managers of the company's branches. My favorite scene was Lou performing some twisted mathematics.While more serious than most of A&C's movies, it does let Lou engage in his usual clumsiness. The main point is that in this setting, there are plenty of folks eager to use his naivete against him.I understand that Bud and Lou were starting to have a falling-out when they made this. They made a few more movies together, but by the end, their relationship had soured so much that Bud learned of Lou's death by reading about it in the newspaper (at least that's what I've heard).Anyway, an interesting movie, if nothing great. 0 out of 1 found this helpful.

      "Abbott & Costello work apart in this experimental film that sees Lou as Benny Miller, a young man living in the country with his mother(played by Mary Gordon). He has just recently completed a correspondence course in becoming a salesman, and goes into the city to become a vacuum cleaner salesman, where he goes to work for it's crooked president played by Abbott, who uses him for his own purposes. He is a bust as a salesman however, though his colleagues play a cruel trick on him that eventually backfires... Elena Verdugo plays Lou's understanding fiancée. Strange film works at keeping them apart, but is seldom funny, and pretty contrived, though innocuous enough to be acceptable viewing. 0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

      "More Hinder Austin John Winkler, the former vocalist of Hinder – the rock band that got to #1 in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and on the US Mainstream Top 40 charts with their single, Lips Of An Angel – has put a country spin on the well-known track with Nashville country singer Shaylen. Lips Of An Angel landed at #1 in Australia in February 2007 and retained that place for seven weeks. The second single from Hinder’s debut album, Extreme Behaviour, made the American rockers a household name. But what if it went country? Winkler claimed that the new version 'still rocks, but it's got a little country twist to it now' in a recent interview with PEOPLE. Telling the story of how Winkler connected with Shaylen and how the collaboration happened, the singer explained, 'There was a guy named Brian Howes, who actually [co-wrote and produced] the first Lips Of An Angel. He was the one who connected us, and that's how I first heard Shaylen's voice. I was blown away.' Shaylen responded, 'When they told me that they would love for me to do it, I literally was dumbfounded. And then to go meet Austin at RCA Studios…it just worked. He’s a fucking rockstar of a human being.' Explaining how the country-fied version of Lips Of An Angel utilises a TikTok trend that shows the female perspective that was often missing in early 2000s rock music videos, Shaylen continued: 'You have the guy perspective in the original, but then you also realise women and humans, in general, go through this feeling every day.

      "'Lips of an Angel' is a song by American rock band Hinder, produced and co-written by Brian Howes and Joseph Lombardo. It was released in April 2006 as the second single from their 2005 debut album, Extreme Behavior. It was their breakthrough hit, charting within the top ten on several US Billboard genre charts, reaching number three on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, and peaking at number one in Australia and New Zealand. It has sold 3.6 million copies in the US as of January 2015, making it one of the most downloaded rock songs. Jack Ingram released a cover of the song in 2006, which reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Content \n",

      "The song is featured in the music-related video games Lips (as downloadable content), Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore, Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party, and Band Hero. On June 12, 2020, the Canadian Blink-182 podcast 'Blink-155' released a compilation, consisting of 65 covers of 'Lips of an Angel', recorded by the members of the Blink-155 fan base (known as the 'Nation' or 'Naysh') as well as the hosts of the podcast, Sam Sutherland & Josiah Hughes. The compilation is titled 'It's Really Good to Hear Your Voice', in reference to one of the lyrics of the song. The compilation was mastered by Dan Birch and the artwork was done by Kyle Mabson. All proceeds from the compilation get donated to charities related to the Black Lives Matter movement.

      "Uncategorized (1) Music Video Analysis – Lips of an Angel by Hinder 0 Hinder – Lips of an Angel This video is a combination of narrative with some performance incorporated in the chorus and bridge sections. Having a combination adds variation to the music video so it doesn’t get too repetitive. The main plot of the video is about a man (lead singer Austin Winkler) who is finding it hard to move on from his last girlfriend. Through the video we see flashbacks of his time with her and moments where he is with his new girlfriend. The flashbacks are presented in a different form to the rest of the video; they are played to us in black and white and as though we are watching an old tape recording; all the memories in these parts are positive. ‘Lips of an Angel’ is the bands second single which came out in 2005. The song made it to the charts in numerous countries including USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. \n",

      "'So, there was a guy named Brian Howes, who actually [co-wrote and produced] the first ‘Lips of an Angel,' Winkler tells PEOPLE. 'He was the one who connected us and that's how I first heard Shaylen's voice. I was blown away.' Shaylen and Austin John Winkler. Taylor Ballantyne 'Blown away’ certainly describes the similar feeling of Shaylen, a pop turned country darling whose rock side shines on the new version of 'Lips of an Angel.' 'When they told me that they would love for me to do it, I literally was dumbfounded,' says the former pop artist who has already attracted much attention with country-tinged songs such as 'Roots' and 'What If I Don’t.' 'And then to go meet Austin at RCA Studios…it just worked. He’s a f---ing rockstar of a human being.' The reimagined version of 'Lips on an Angel' also materialized thanks to the viral 'female perspective' TikTok trend, allowing for the chance to finally give the girl on the phone's viewpoint. 'I mean, I think that's the really cool part,' explains Shaylen. 'You have the guy perspective in the original, but then you also realize women and humans in general go through this feeling every day. No matter if you're male or female, you are always wondering if they're doing good. It’s really cool to be given the opportunity to have that voice on the female part.' Austin John Winkler and Shaylen. Taylor Ballantyne Shaylen Opens Up About Her Move from Pop to Country: 'Something in My Heart Wasn't Happy Anymore' Certainly, 'Lips of an Angel' is a song Shaylen has plenty of history with. 'It was definitely a childhood staple for me,' reflects Shaylen in a recent interview with PEOPLE about the song included on Hinder’s 2005 debut album, Extreme Behavior. 'I would play Nickelback and then I would play Hinder. I'd look out the car window and I would think I was in a music video.' She laughs. 'I was so dramatic!' Shaylen and Austin John Winkler. Aly Marotte And Winkler is quick to note that the reimagined version of 'Lips of an Angel' 'still rocks, but it's got a little country twist to it now,' so too does the music video have a little twist of its own. 'You think Austin and I the whole time are talking to each other,' says Shaylen about the storyline of the music video premiering exclusively on PEOPLE. 'But when they set up the treatment, it was so sick because you think we were talking to each other and then you realize we're both talking to other people. So, it's a nice little turn of events because when I saw that, I was like, ‘Hell yeah, that's fire.’' Shaylen and Austin John Winkler. Taylor Ballantyne So too is the fire that ignites between Shaylen and Winkler in the music video. \n",

      "John Andrews, Webb Zerafa, Menkes HousdenOther informationPublic transit accessUnion StationSt. Andrew stationWebsitewww.cntower.caReferences The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3 m-high (1,815.3 ft) concrete communications and observation tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. Its name 'CN' referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government's real estate portfolio. The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower. It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers. It is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline and attracts more than two million international visitors annually. It houses several observation decks, a revolving restaurant at some 350 metres (1,150 ft), and an entertainment complex. History CN Tower from the Toronto Islands The original concept of the CN Tower was first conceived in 1968 when the Canadian National Railway wanted to build a large television and radio communication platform to serve the Toronto area, and to demonstrate the strength of Canadian industry and CN in particular. These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972. The tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see CityPlace), a large development south of Front Street on the Railway Lands, a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant after the opening of the MacMillan Yard north of the city in 1965 (then known as Toronto Yard). Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; John Andrews Architects; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division). \n",
      "\n",
      "Two years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that 'All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,' and that 'Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.' Phases of construction Constructing the base, July 1973 Brackets being raised, August 1974 Helicopter lifting part of antenna, March 1975 Main pod construction, April 1975 Nearing completion, December 1975 Two months after opening, August 1976 Opening The CN Tower opened on June 26, 1976. The construction costs of approximately CA$63 million ($318 million in 2023 dollars) were repaid in fifteen years. \n",
      "\n",
      "On June 26, 1986, the tenth anniversary of the tower's opening, high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate Dan Goodwin, in a sponsored publicity event, used his hands and feet to climb the outside of the tower, a feat he performed twice on the same day. Following both ascents, he used multiple rappels to descend to the ground. From 1985 to 1992, the CN Tower basement level hosted the world's first flight simulator ride, Tour of the Universe, based on the flight of a Space Shuttle. The ride was replaced in 1992 with a similar attraction entitled 'Space Race.' It was later dismantled and replaced by two other rides in 1998 and 1999. The 1990s and 2000s \n",
      "\n",
      "The CN Tower consists of several substructures. The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the stairwells and power and plumbing connections. The tower's six elevators are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the tower; the tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the tower is a 102 m (334.6 ft) tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying television and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace, which are both located at an elevation of 342 m (1,122 ft), the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as 'Indoor Observation Level') located at 346 m (1,135 ft), and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as 'Space Deck') at 446.5 m (1,465 ft), just below the metal antenna. The hexagonal shape is visible between the two highest areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large tripod. \n",

      "Panorama as viewed from the CN Tower: Toronto Islands and Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport on Lake Ontario on left; Toronto's Financial District on right Lighting Illuminated in the colours of the Flag of France following the November 2015 Paris attacks The CN Tower was originally lit at night with incandescent lights, which were removed in 1997 because they were inefficient and expensive to repair. In June 2007, the tower was outfitted with 1,330 super-bright LED lights inside the elevator shafts, shooting over the main pod and upward to the top of the tower's mast to light the tower from dusk until 2 a.m. The official opening ceremony took place on June 28, 2007, before the Canada Day holiday weekend. The tower changes its lighting scheme on holidays and to commemorate major events. After the 95th Grey Cup in Toronto, the tower was lit in green and white to represent the colours of the Grey Cup champion Saskatchewan Roughriders. From sundown on August 27, 2011, to sunrise the following day, the tower was lit in orange, the official colour of the New Democratic Party (NDP), to commemorate the death of federal NDP leader and leader of the official opposition Jack Layton. When former South African president Nelson Mandela died, the tower was lit in the colours of the South African flag. When former federal finance minister under Stephen Harper's Conservatives Jim Flaherty died, the tower was lit in green to reflect his Irish Canadian heritage. On the night of the attacks on Paris on November 13, 2015, the tower displayed the colours of the French flag. On June 8, 2021, the tower displayed the colours of the Toronto Maple Leafs' archrivals Montreal Canadiens after they advanced to the semifinals of 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs. The CN Tower was lit in the colours of the Ukrainian flag during the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taller than the CN Tower are numerous radio masts and towers, which are held in place by guy-wires, the tallest being the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, in the United States at 628 m (2,060 ft) tall, leading to a distinction between these and 'free-standing' structures. Additionally, the Petronius Platform stands 610 m (2,001 ft) above its base on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico near the Mississippi River Delta, but only the top 75 m (246 ft) of this oil and natural gas platform are above water, and the structure is thus partially supported by its buoyancy. Like the CN Tower, none of these taller structures are commonly considered buildings. On September 12, 2007, Burj Khalifa, which is a hotel, residential and commercial building in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (formerly known as Burj Dubai before opening), passed the CN Tower's 553.33-m height. The CN Tower held the record of the tallest freestanding structure on land for over 30 years. \n",

      "Although it’s a completely different country, Toronto is only about a 4.5-hour drive from where I’m living in metro Detroit, so it was an easy trip. My parents came along too! I hadn’t been to Toronto since college, and I’d forgotten how big and tall Toronto is. Endless skyscrapers! The tallest structure, though, is the CN Tower. It’s 1,815 feet tall, and was the tallest free-standing structure in the world from 1976, when it was completed, until 2007. Now it’s the tallest free-standing structure in the western hemisphere, and the ninth-tallest in the world. The observation levels are not at the very top. The tower extends far above them. The first of the four public levels is 1,122 feet above the sidewalk, roughly 2/3rds of the way up. That’s where the race ends. Well, kind of. (I’ll get into this later.) \n",

The CHP has primary patrol jurisdiction over all California highways and roads and streets outside city limits, and can exercise law enforcement powers anywhere within the state. The California Highway Patrol can assist local and county agencies and can patrol major city streets along with local and county law enforcement, state and interstate highways, and is the primary law enforcement agency in rural parts of the state. The California State Legislature originally established the California Highway Patrol as a branch of the Division of Motor Vehicles in the Department of Public Works, with legislation signed by Governor C. C. Young on August 14, 1929. It was subsequently established as a separate department with legislation signed by Governor Earl Warren in 1947. The CHP gradually assumed increased responsibility beyond the enforcement of the State Vehicle Act and eventually merged with the smaller California State Police in 1995. It is currently organized as part of the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA). In addition to its highway patrol duties, the CHP also provides other services including protecting state buildings and facilities (most notably the California State Capitol) and guarding state officials. The CHP also works with municipal and federal law enforcement agencies, providing assistance in investigations, patrol and other aspects of law enforcement. The agency is responsible for law enforcement on all California state routes (including all freeways and expressways), U.S. Highways, Interstate Highways and all public roads in unincorporated and incorporated portions of any specific county. Local police or the local sheriff's department having a contract with an incorporated city are primarily responsible for investigating and enforcing traffic laws in incorporated cities, but any peace officer of the CHP can still enforce any state law anywhere within the state, even though the agency's primary mission is related to transportation. Furthermore, CHP officers act as bailiffs for the California Supreme Court and the six California Courts of Appeal, and also provide security at buildings occupied by the State of California. The Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle replaced the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor in 2013. \n",
      "\n",
      "The California Highway Patrol's additional responsibilities includes a governor protection detail. Somewhat controversially, the cities of Oakland and Stockton have contracted with the California Highway Patrol to assist their police departments with local patrol duties, including traffic stops and responding to 911 calls. Pay and pensions Average officer pay was $118,000 in 2014. By law, salaries are set by an average of the five largest police departments in the state. In 2012, the top paid CHP officer received $483,581, 44 other officers earning over $200,000, and over 5,000 officers receiving over $100,000. In 2011, CHP officers earned $82.4 million in overtime, triple the amount in the second largest state, and with one officer earning over $93,000 in overtime alone. Officers are strictly prohibited from working more than 16.5 hours at a time before having to take a minimum 8-hour break. \n",
      "\n",
      "CHP uniforms are traditionally khaki-colored with campaign hat and blue-and-gold trouser stripe. Command officers wear a tan combination cap. The dress uniform includes a forest green jacket and royal blue tie (bow tie for motor officers). Cold weather and utility uniforms are dark blue.California Highway Patrol campaign hat Leather gear is black basketweave leather with brass snaps and buckles. Standard traffic enforcement patrol vehicles are required by state law to have a white door with, in the case of the CHP, a star. The CHP operates traditional black and white as well as all-white patrol vehicles. The California Highway Patrol is one of the few organizations to continue to use the older toll-free 'Zenith 1-2000' number. With the falling cost of telephone area code 800 and 888 numbers, most organizations have chosen to switch to one of the newer numbers and discontinue use of the Zenith service, which requires operator assistance. The CHP's traditions include its own radio codes, widely adopted by local agencies. The most important is 11‑99, which signifies that an officer needs emergency assistance or that an officer is down. \n",
      "\n",
      "The 'Mexico Liaison Unit' is a Border Division Unit based in San Diego. Since the CHP has no jurisdiction directly in Mexico, officers from the Unit work closely with Mexican authorities to recover stolen vehicles and assist with other law enforcement issues. The purpose of the 'Mexico Liaison Unit' is to develop and maintain positive working relations with Mexican authorities in order to: Locate and identify stolen U.S. vehicles taken to Mexico Identify vehicle thieves and ensure their prosecution, either in Mexico or California Provide assistance to Mexican and U.S. authorities The unit was originally established in 1958 and only consisted of one officer. It was discontinued in the 1970s, and reestablished in 1980. The unit now consists of one sergeant and six officers, all of whom are fluent in Spanish.

      "\n",
      "A follow-up investigation eventually led to a complete revision of procedures during high-risk and felony stops. Firearms procedures have also changed fundamentally due to this incident, and physical methods of arrest have been improved. The police baton and pepper spray have been added to the officer's arsenal, with more in‑depth training in their use. The 25th anniversary of the Newhall Incident was observed on April 6, 1995, at the present Newhall Area office, where a brick memorial pays tribute to Officers George Alleyn (6290), Walt Frago (6520), Roger Gore (6547) and James Pence (6885). The memorial once stood at the former Newhall office, but was rebuilt at the new site, about one mile (1.6 km) from the scene of the slayings. History of the former California State Police and its Merger with the California Highway Patrol On July 12, 1995, the California State Police, which was a separate agency, was merged into the CHP, thus greatly expanding the agency's mandate. In addition to safety on the state highway system, it is now responsible for the safety of all elected state officials and all people who work in or are utilizing a state building in California, such as the State Capitol Building in Sacramento. It has also been discussed to merge the Law Enforcement Division of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife into the California Highway Patrol. By doing so, this may allow for better protection of California's environment and natural resources. The underfunded CDFW Law Enforcement Division has faced low numbers of Game Wardens also known as Wildlife Officers for the last ten years; a similar idea is already in place in Oregon and Alaska, where the Oregon State Police and Alaska State Troopers serve as game wardens under a separate fish and wildlife division within the two departments.

      "'Where the Red Fern Grows' by Wilson Rawls is one of the most popular works of children's literature ever written. It is about a boy who buys and trains two Redbone Coonhounds for hunting. The book is a work of autobiographical fiction based on Rawls' own childhood in the Ozarks. My friend Eileen, the dog trainer, currently lives in Minnesota but we met when she lived in Florida. I suspect it’s cold in Minnesota during the winter like the Ozarks. I called New Year's Day to brag about a new kayak my boyfriend and I had gotten at Christmas because I had met Eileen while volunteering at a sailing non-profit for the disabled and we both loved the water, but I did not get an answer. 'Where the Red Fern Grows' is a coming-of-age story which deals with the classic theme of maturity as Billy learns to work hard, be a leader, and be self-reliant. Because the setting is in the Ozarks, man's relationship to nature is part of the ongoing narrative. A lesson often repeated in the book is that hard work pays off. This can be illustrated by how Billy saved up and purchased the two Redbone Coonhounds dogs, and then trained them. Throughout the story, we see how love, and not just loyalty, enables the trio to persist and overcome. I was not surprised that Eileen trained dogs after working with her at Sailability, the non-profit. She was such a dedicated and patient soul. I was even more impressed when she took in a puppy to train to be a service dog. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where the Red Fern Grows is a children’s book by Wilson Rawls and it is the story of a young boy, longing for two red hounds while living in the Ozarks with his family in the woods. Billy works hard for two years and secretively saves enough money, $50, to buy two hound puppies that he reads about in a magazine left behind by outdoorsmen in the woods and the river bottoms he frequents. With the help of his grandfather, Billy gets his pups, then he raises them and teaches them to hunt 'coons', and becomes somewhat famous in his little neck of the woods of Oklahoma. Billy names his pups Old Dan and Little Nan in a touching moment of the story that I will leave you to find out someday if you read the book. The story is about the love of a boy for his dogs and the love of a family. It is about overcoming obstacles to achieve goals and it is about faith and endurance and character as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The story, a novel, is based on Wilson Rawls’ childhood. Rawls grew up, much as Billy does, on a small farm in the Ozarks. His mother taught him to read until he and his sister could finally attend school. It took him years and years to write Where the Red Fern Grows, which started first as a serial,'Hounds of Youth' in the 'Saturday Evening Post' and was first published as an adult novel. Only when schoolchildren started to read it and launched a campaign for it to become a children’s book did it reach the level of fame it has maintained since 1961. We get two good stories out of Where the Red Fern Grows; the story of Billy, Old Dan and Little Nan, and the story of Wilson Rawls.

      "Book Review ~ Where The Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls – Planet Books Skip to content Planet Books Book Review ~ Where The Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls Published on June 25, 2008June 25, 2008 by Lady K Quilts Summary ~ 'Billy, Old Dan and Little Ann – A Boy and His Two Dogs… A loving threesome, they ranged the dark hills and river bottoms of Cherokee country.  Old Dan had the brawn, little Ann had the brains – and Billy had the will to train them to be the finest hunting team in the valley.  Glory and victory were coming to them, but sadness waited too.  And close by was the strange and wonderful power that’s only found… Where the Red Fern Grows.' Monday, I finished 'Where the Red Fern Grows' by Wilson Rawls.  Though I needed a box of tissues to get through the end of the book, I loved every exhilarating, loving and heartbreaking word.  I sat there with my dog Rocky laying in my lap and read the last pages about Billy’s childhood and the little hunting dogs who changed his life. 'Where the Red Fern Grows' is a story about a determined boy with a terrible case of 'dog-wanting disease' set in the Ozarks of northeastern Oklahoma during the Great Depression.  After saying a prayer asking for help with getting his hunting pups, Billy Coleman spent two long years working to earn and save $50.00 to buy two little hunting puppies he had seen listed in a fisherman’s discarded magazine.  With the help of his Grandfather, his prayer is answered. 'I wanted so much to step over and pick them up.  Several times I tried to move my feet, but they seemed to be nailed to the floor.  I knew the pups were mine, all mine, yet I couldn’t move.  My heart started acting like a drunk grasshopper.  I tried to swallow and couldn’t.  My Adam’s apple wouldn’t work. One pup started my way.  I held my breath.  On he came until I felt a scratchy little foot on mine.  The other pup followed.  A warm puppy tongue caressed my sore foot. I heard the stationmaster say, 'They already know you.' \n",

      "'Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.' -Ecclesiastes 4:9 One of my favorite books is Where the Red Fern Grows. I first read this book when I was in the 5th grade. It is a wonderful book about a young boy, Billy Coleman, who dreams of having his own hunting dogs. Billy works and saves to buy two Redbone Coonhounds. When the two young pups arrive, Billy names them Dan and Ann. Billy and the dogs are inseparable. They spend their free time hunting. The theme of the well-loved book is relationship and adventure. The book records the many adventures in the Ozark mountains, while allowing the reader to see how powerful the love between a boy and dogs can truly be. \n",

      "Disney presents Wilson Rawls' unforgettable classic story about a boy and his dogs, which has been loved for generations. Now all the adventure and simple wisdom of the cherished novel come alive in the all-new movie WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS. What 10-year-old Billy Coleman (Joseph Ashton) wants most in the world is a hunting dog. After two long years of hard work, he saves up enough money to buy a pair of redbone hound pups, and it's love at first sight! Before long, Billy trains 'Old Dan' and 'Little Ann' to be the finest hunting team in the valley. As the inseparable trio chase the wily 'ghost raccoon' and confront danger together, Billy learns the meaning of loyalty, courage, and perseverance. Featuring songs by Wynonna and Alison Krauss, and starring Ned Beatty, Dabney Coleman, Kris Kristofferson, and recording sensation Dave Matthews in his film debut, WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS is a timeless tale of love and friendship that will entertain and inspire the entire family.

      "Where the Red Fern Grows is the story of a farm boy named Billy who desperately wants  his very own pair of coonhounds. When his father tells him that they are too expensive Billy works to earn the money to buy them on his own–selling bait and fruit to local fishermen. He eventually earns the money and buys a girl and boy coonhound, whom he names Little Ann and Old Dan. The story follows the trio’s adventures–fighting mountain lions, camping out in caves, and cutting down enormous trees all in the name of catching raccoons. Old Dan is eventually killed by a mountain lion and Little Ann dies a few days later of a broken heart. A red fern, which according to Native American legend can only be planted by an angel, sprouts on top of their gravesite. \n",

      "It may have been a name given to him, and, as you’ll see below, perhaps for good reason. Squanto was to become the primary force behind the Pilgrims’ unlikely survival in the New World. On March 22, 1621, the vernal equinox, Squanto walked out of the forest into the middle of the Pilgrims’ ramshackle base at Plymouth, a settlement known to Squanto as Patuxet. That place was once his home. To the Pilgrims’ amazement, Squanto spoke nearly perfect English, and arrived prepared to remain with them and guide them through everything from fishing to agriculture to negotiations with the nervous and well-armed Massasoit and the Wampanoag.As historian Charles C. Mann wrote in 'Native Intelligence,' (Smithsonian, December 2005), 'Tisquantum was critical to the colony’s survival.' Squanto taught them to plant the native corn they had stolen instead of just eating it, and he negotiated a fair trade for the theft of the corn. \n",

      "The Mayflower set sail from the English port of Plymouth on September 6, 1620. A leaky old wine ship, it carried 102 passengers, plus around thirty crewmen and various livestock. The passengers were mostly English members of a dissenting Separatist congregation that had lived in exile in the Dutch city of Leiden, together with their servants. Also traveling on the Mayflower were people the other passengers called 'strangers.' These were a mixed group of emigrants recruited by the Merchant Adventurers, a trading company based in London that had invested in the journey as a commercial opportunity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mayflower embarked about sixty-five passengers in London about the middle of July 1620, proceeded to Southampton on the English south coast and met Speedwell bringing the Leyden contingent from Holland. The two ships planned to begin their trans-Atlantic journey on 5 August, but problems with Speedwell, which could not be corrected, caused the loss of a month of critical voyage time with the fall Atlantic gale season coming on. After two false starts and repairs to Speedwell, some of the passengers chose not to continue and returned to Holland on Speedwell. The remaining passengers boarded the Mayflower, which with 102 passengers and a crew of possibly 30-40, finally departed Plymouth, Devon on 6 September O.S. (16 September, N.S.). After 66 days of fighting gales and with the ship's timbers rupturing, and with a detriment to the health of all on board, the Mayflower finally arrived within the waters of the Cape Cod Bay on 11 November before anchoring off what is now Provincetown. Recent research has revealed that the ship docked at the tiny fishing village of Renews in Newfoundland for fresh water and food before arriving in Provincetown. The Mayflower and its passengers and crew would proceed to establish a settlement at Plymouth, on the other side of the Cape Cod Bay from Provincetown. \n",

      "The Mayflower made excellent time on her return voyage back to England. The westerly winds that had buffeted the ship on departure pushed her along going home, and she arrived at her home port in Rotherhithe on the Thames on 5 May 1621 – less than half the time it had taken her to sail to America. Among the 102 passengers were six Essex residents from the Great Burstead area, south-west of Harwich. These included Christopher Martin, the Mayflower's treasurer who was responsible for provisioning the ship, his wife, step-son and servant, together with two single men from Great Burstead – Peter Browne and Richard Britteridge. All died that first winter in Plymouth except Peter Browne. After Jones' return from New England, by the summer of 1621 he had resumed his former trading voyages to continental Europe. But by this time it had become evident that the severe deprivations of the Pilgrim voyage had badly undermined his health, as it had so many other Mayflower voyagers. \n",

      "The Pilgrims had originally hoped to reach America by early October using two ships, but delays and complications meant they could use only one, Mayflower. Arriving in November, they had to survive unprepared through a harsh winter. As a result, only half of the original Pilgrims survived the first winter at Plymouth. If not for the help of local indigenous peoples to teach them food gathering and other survival skills, all of the colonists might have perished. The following year, those 53 who survived celebrated the colony's first fall harvest along with 90 Wampanoag Native American people, an occasion declared in centuries later the first American Thanksgiving. Before disembarking the Mayflower, the Pilgrims wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact, an agreement that established a rudimentary government, in which each member would contribute to the safety and welfare of the planned settlement. As one of the earliest colonial vessels, the ship has become a cultural icon in the history of the United States. \n",

      "It was before setting anchor that the male Pilgrims and non-Pilgrim passengers (whom members of the congregation referred to as 'Strangers') drew up and signed the Mayflower Compact.: 54  Among the resolutions in the Compact were those establishing legal order and meant to quell increasing strife within the ranks. Myles Standish was selected to make sure the rules were obeyed, as there was a consensus that discipline would need to be enforced to ensure the survival of the planned colony.: 54  Once they agreed to settle and build a self-governing community, they came ashore. The moment the Pilgrims stepped ashore was described by William Bradford, the second Governor of the Plymouth Colony: \n",

      "At the end of November, Captain Jones led an expedition by open boat, exploring the harsh snow-covered coastline to find a suitable site for the colony. They came across buried corn and burial sites in an abandoned village, Patuxet. Before the Pilgrims’ journey, other settlers had brought European diseases which wiped out indigenous communities. ‘Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor’ by William Halsall. Source: Public Domain. At Christmas 1620, the Mayflower set sail again, arriving at what would be their new home, known today as Plymouth, Massachusetts. 10. Plymouth, Massachusetts With temperatures below freezing, the Pilgrims remained on the Mayflower. The ship offered some protection from the bitter winter, but they were starving, and many had been struck down with scurvy, tuberculosis and pneumonia. Only around 50 passengers survived, along with just half the crew. A postcard of ‘The Landing of the Pilgrims’ taken from a painting by Charles Lucy. Public Domain. \n",

      "The pilgrims, in this case, were people who believed life in the Western part of the world to be one of the New World – where opportunities could be found in larger capacities and where they were free from religious persecution. Men, women and children comprised the 102 passengers in the Mayflower ship that undertook the journey and created a place for itself in the pages of world history. These people thought that the Church of England had begun systematic oppression and wished to leave England for this reason. They were also called separationists since they disagreed with King Henry VIII on the powers and operations of the Church. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of the many pilgrims on board the Mayflower, two noted individuals were William Bradford and Miles Standish. They served as the Second Governor and First Military Commander at the newly established Plymouth colony. Another person was Edward Winslow, a separatist leader and a skilled diplomat. He was instrumental in brokering peace between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe. After the trans-Atlantic crossing, the ship returned to England on May 6th 1621, after setting sail from the United States on the 5th of the previous month. After this journey and the death of its Captain and owner Christopher Jones in 1622, the ship was sent for an Admiralty appraisal because it was unused due to its dilapidated condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Mayflower set sail on 16th September 1620 from Plymouth, UK, to voyage to America. But its history and story start long before that. Its passengers were in search of a new life – some seeking religious freedom, others a fresh start in a different land. They would go on to be known as the Pilgrims and influence the future of the United States of America in ways they could never have imagined. This story isn't just about the Mayflower's passengers though. It's about the people who already lived in America and the enormous effect the arrival of these colonists would have on Native Americans and the land they had called home for centuries. More than 30 million people can trace their ancestry to the 102 passengers and approximately 30 crew aboard the Mayflower when it landed in Plymouth Bay, Massachusetts, in the harsh winter of 1620. On board were men, women and children from different walks of life across England and the city of Leiden in Holland. \n",

But, without a doubt, Disney's star couple is Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse. The two have been inseparable since their first appearance in Walt Disney Studio's short film Steamboat Willie (1928). Over the years, many different talents have lent their voices to Mickey and Minnie, but only one pair has shared their own love story.

Unlike many of Disney's early silent cartoons, Mickey and Minnie have always been speaking characters. Disney's Steamboat Willie made a splash on the scene when it became the first animated film to use synchronized sound. A year prior, The Jazz Singer would have been the first live-action feature-length film to utilize the new technology. Although rudimentary by today's standards, Steamboat Willie was groundbreaking in its time. And it would have been the first place that audiences were introduced to the now-famous figureheads of the entertainment giant. Walt Disney was the original voice of Mickey Mouse. Although in Steamboat Willie, Mickey and Minnie didn't have any lines but merely made noises reacting to their situations, Walt was particular about Mickey. Disney animation director Lauren MacMullan said in an interview, 'There’s something about Walt’s voice from that era that is sort of innocent . . . In later years, Mickey’s voice is easily parody-able. But this early Mickey sounds like he means it.' Walt would go on to voice Mickey in over 100 shorts and on into the 1940s.

He had no idea that one day this little mouse he drew on a scrap piece of paper would become one of the most recognizable logos in history. On May 15, 1928, the very first Mickey Mouse short was aired, titled Plane Crazy. Most of the work done on this was by Walt’s right hand man, Ub Iwerks. Minnie made her debut in the same short, both appearing alongside each other as love interests from the beginning.

He was also the voice actor for Jaq and Gus in Cinderella, the Dormouse in Alice in Wonderland, and Chip and Dale in some of their film shorts. He voiced Mickey for different films and television specials until 1976 when he retired. The third voice for Mickey debuted in 1977, with Wayne Allwine. His voice is the one we all probably know the best, as his voice starred in films such as A Goofy Movie, Mickey’s Once Upon a Christmas, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Fantasia 2000, and many more.

      "'The Death of Superman' is divided into three story arcs: 'Doomsday!', 'Funeral for a Friend', and 'Reign of the Supermen!'. The first arc chronicles Superman's fight with the monster Doomsday and concludes with his death. The second depicts Superman's fellow superheroes and the rest of the DC Universe mourning his death, ending with his adoptive father Jonathan Kent having a heart attack. The third sees the emergence of four Superman impostors before the original is resurrected. A number of characters in 'The Death of Superman', such as Doomsday, Superboy, the Cyborg Superman, Steel, and The Eradicator would recur in later DC publications. When news broke that DC planned to kill Superman, a beloved cultural icon, 'The Death of Superman' received unprecedented coverage from the mainstream media. Superman #75, which features Superman's death, sold over six million copies and became the top-selling comic of 1992. Retrospective reviewers are divided on the story, with some finding it ambitious and influential, while others dismiss it as a publicity stunt. The story has been adapted into various forms of media, including two novelizations in 1993 and a beat 'em up video game, The Death and Return of Superman, in 1994. A loose animated film adaptation, Superman: Doomsday, was released in 2007. A second animated adaptation was released as a two-part film, The Death of Superman and Reign of the Supermen, in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

It felt like a story that could make the readers care again, the way we had always cared about Superman'. 'The Death of Superman' forced DC to cancel a non-canon, four-issue limited series Neil Gaiman and Matt Wagner were working on, as it also featured the character's death.

The crossover began the following issue, in which Doomsday is unleashed and begins to carve a brutal path of destruction across America. This leads to Superman's death in Superman #75, which DC published on November 18, 1992. There were several variants of issue #75: a standard newsstand edition; a direct market edition; and a collector's edition sold in a polybag with a black armband, poster, stickers, and a trading card, which cost more than the standard edition. Following the in-comics funeral, all the Superman publications went on hiatus until the release of The Adventures of Superman #500. Like Superman #75, collector's editions of The Adventures of Superman #500 came in polybags. One version had a translucent white bag with the red Superman logo, while another came in a black bag with a white logo. Each installment of the story received a second printing. \n",
      "\n",
      "DC published the story in three collected volumes from 1992 to 1993: The Death of Superman, World Without a Superman, and The Return of Superman. The Death of Superman was released in time for the 1992 Christmas shopping season and, according to comics historian Matthew K. Manning, is the bestselling trade paperback of all time. Reprints of these collections were published in 2003, 1998, and 2004, respectively, while a recolored edition of The Death of Superman was released in 2013. In September 2007, DC released an omnibus edition of the story, The Death and Return of Superman Omnibus. It features all the issues from previous collections along with 40 pages dedicated to promotional materials and interviews, for a total of 784 pages. Jurgens also contributed new cover art. A new version of the omnibus edition was published in 2013, while another reissue was released in 2019. 'The Death of Superman' is divided into a trilogy of story arcs; the first is known as 'Doomsday!', which leads to Superman's death at the hands of Doomsday. The second story arc, 'Funeral for a Friend', which focuses on the immediate aftermath of Superman's death, began with The Adventures of Superman #498 (January 1993). The final story arc, 'Reign of the Supermen!', began with a prologue in The Adventures of Superman #500 and introduced the Supermen. The title of this arc references Siegel and Shuster's first Superman story, 'The Reign of the Superman'. It crosses into the larger DC Universe, with Green Lantern #46 (October 1993) featuring a tie-in story. Despite the gap between the releases of 'Funeral for a Friend' and 'Reign of the Supermen!', no time passed within the continuity of the comics. 'The Death of Superman' concluded in October 1993 with The Adventures of Superman #505, in which Superman returns to Metropolis. Characters \n",

      "Superman's death stuns and traumatizes the residents of the DC Universe. His funeral is attended by nearly every superhero, as well as some supervillains, then President Bill Clinton, and First Lady Hillary Clinton. Every hero wears a black arm band featuring Superman's crest. After the funeral, Project Cadmus steals Superman's body from his mausoleum to clone him, but Lane and Supergirl recover it. With Superman gone, the crime rate rises; the costumed heroes of Metropolis, including a team funded by Luthor, rise to fill in as protectors but are insufficient. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2011, DC relaunched its entire comics line in an initiative called The New 52, which revamped the DC Universe and erased certain events. The relaunch altered Superman considerably, characterizing him as shorter-tempered and no longer married to Lois Lane. However, 'The Death of Superman' remained intact in the new DC Universe. To coincide with the release of the animated film adaptation of the crossover in 2018, a 12-part Death of Superman webcomic series began, written by Simonson and illustrated by Cat Staggs, Joel Ojeda, and Laura Braga, among others. The first parts chronicle Superman's actions hours before Doomsday kills him; later parts follow Jimmy Olsen during the confrontation and the aftermath of Superman's death. The 2019 one-shot Tales from the Dark Multiverse: The Death of Superman imagines a reality where Superman's death causes Lois Lane to have a psychological breakdown. Lois goes to the Fortress of Solitude and learns the Eradicator failed to restore Superman. Lois merges with the Eradicator and uses her new abilities to force the world to accept Superman's ideals. Her murder of criminals leads other heroes to oppose her, including the Cyborg Superman, Steel, and Superboy. Convinced she is correct, Lois fully adopts the identity of the Eradicator. Adaptations Stern wrote a novelization of 'The Death of Superman', The Death and Life of Superman, in 1993. Additionally, Simonson wrote another adaptation, Superman: Doomsday & Beyond, around the same time. It features cover art by Alex Ross. \n",
      "\n",
      "The DC Extended Universe series of films contains references to 'The Death of Superman', beginning with the appearance of Superman's black suit in Man of Steel (2013). The climax of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) draws narrative elements from 'Doomsday!'. In the film, Lex Luthor uses forbidden Kryptonian genetic engineering projects to combine General Zod's corpse with his own DNA, creating Doomsday. During their fight, Superman and Doomsday deliver killing blows, respectively, and both die. Jurgens received a 'Special Thanks' credit at the end of the film. In Justice League (2017), the black suit reappears as an Easter egg in a deleted scene. Costume designer Michael Wilkinson explained that director Zack Snyder planned to have Superman wear the suit when he was resurrected in the film, but scrapped the idea in pre-production. Superman wore the black suit in Snyder's 2021 director's cut of the film, Zack Snyder's Justice League. \n",

      "A Change Is Gonna Come – 365 Days of Aretha Franklin Skip to content 365 Days of Aretha Franklin An Aretha Franklin Song A Day Home Contact A Change Is Gonna Come December 11, 2019 Andrew Martone Uncategorized One comment Closing out her magnanimous 1967 debut for Atlantic Records, I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You, Aretha Franklin covered of one of the most powerful cuts of the 1960’s: Sam Cooke’s 'A Change Is Gonna Come.' Naturally, from the opening line, Aretha put her own spin on it. 'There’s an old friend that, I once heard say, something that touched my heart. And it began this way,' Aretha sings while playing the piano in tribute to her late friend and idol. The history of 'A Change Is Gonna Come' is ever-storied. Sam Cooke wrote it in-part after hearing Bob Dylan’s 'Blowin In The Wind.' He was also likely influenced by a recent racist experience he’d endured. The song is heavy. The lush strings, horns, and bombastic timpani drums of Sam’s original are nothing short of iconic. The arrangement is powerful. The ominous tone Sam lays evokes a lot of feeling. Sam performed the song but once, and the video of that performance is nowhere to be found across the web. He couldn’t bare to perform it again, and his life was cut short not long after. \n",
      "\n",
      "What’s astonishing is that both live albums, as different as they are, are equally good performances. Cooke by this point was an artist who could perform in any style, and for any audience, and do it well. In November 1964, Cooke recorded a dance song, 'Shake', and he prepared a shortened edit of 'A Change is Gonna Come' to release as its B-side. The single was scheduled for release on December 22nd. Both sides charted, but by the time the single came out, Sam Cooke was dead. And from this point on, the story gets even more depressing and upsetting than it has been. \n",
      "\n",
      "To listen to the song A Change Is Gonna Come (1964) closely for the first time – with your head touching the speakers and the crackle of electricity from the living room carpet humming beneath you – is to feel the potential of music made in protest. When I happened upon the song at the end of an otherwise average ‘greatest hits’ compilation, I began to understand how a piece of music can affect a feeling of transformation. The story about the song is that Cooke heard Bob Dylan sing Blowin’ in the Wind (1963), and wrote A Change Is Gonna Come as a response and a call-out, both to Dylan and himself. The way Cooke saw it, a black man should be singing stuff like that, not some white kid from suburbia. By then, Cooke had crossed over from his gospel roots into mainstream success. He owned his own record label and controlled his career. But he lived with the paradoxes of black stardom. \n",
      "\n",
      "'A Change is Gonna Come' was as cathartic a songwriting experience for Sam Cooke as it was transformative a song for anyone who has heard it. It is an allegorical civics tale, snugly wrapped in the soothing Balm of Gilead, mesmerizingly delivered by Sam Cooke’s honey-drenched tenor. Fifty-four years after Sam’s death, it continues to captivate Millennials and Baby Boomers alike. It knows no age, gender or racial barriers, though undoubtedly, as the Anthem of the Civil Rights Movement for which it was intended, its uplifting qualities, and soulful inspiration remain boundless. Of this, Sam Cooke would be most proud. B.G.

      "Cooke first performed 'A Change Is Gonna Come' on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on February 7, 1964. Cooke's new manager, Allen Klein, was infatuated with the song and persuaded Cooke to do away with promoting his most recent single, 'Ain't That Good News', and perform 'Change' instead, feeling that that was the statement he needed to make before a national audience. Cooke objected, noting that the album's release was a month away and that he had no time to pull together an arrangement within such a short time frame. Klein arranged for RCA to pay for a full string section and Cooke performed the song that Friday on The Tonight Show after performing 'Basin Street'. An NBC timekeeper logged down the number as 'It's a Long Time Coming,' but the network did not save the tape of the performance. Klein and Alexander both felt it would become a milestone moment in Cooke's career, but it was overshadowed by the Beatles' performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS just two days later. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cooke was arrested and jailed, along with several of his entourage, for disturbing the peace. ‘A Change Is Gonna Come’ was written sometime in the next month, before being recorded in February 1964.  After the session, writes Guralnick, Cooke played the song for Bobby Womack: When he first played it for Bobby Womack, who was his protégé, he said, ‘What’s it sound like?’ And Bobby said, ‘It sounds like death.’ Sam said, ‘Man, that’s kind of how it sounds like to me. That’s why I’m never going to play it in public.’ And Bobby sort of rethought it and said, ‘Well, it’s not like death, but it sounds kind of spooky. You could call it that. When ‘A Change Is Gonna Come’ was finally released as a single, it was eleven days after Cooke had been shot and killed at a Los Angeles motel, in what was later ruled a justifiable homicide. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cooke first performed ‘A Change Is Gonna Come’ on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and after that decided to never perform the song again because of the complexity of the arrangement and the ominous nature of the lyrics. In December 1964, an edited version of the song was prepared for single release, but just two weeks before the song’s release, Cooke was fatally shot at a Los Angeles hotel. The civil rights movement immediately picked up on the song and it became one of several anthems of the movement. Though it was only a modest hit for Cooke in comparison to his previous singles, ‘A Change Is Gonna Come’, is considered one of Cooke’s greatest and most influential compositions. It’s legacy is long and enduring because despite its melancholy, it has a universal message of hope that is timeless. Cooke’s lyrics, not only goes hand in hand with Dr King’s ‘I Have A Dream’ speech but can be adapted to whatever goal or movement of the time. \n",

      "a change is gonna come palaver strings | nicholas phan featuring farayi malek A Change Is Gonna Come celebrates the rich legacy of American protest songs, from beloved anthems to new commissions. Our arrangements of 1960s classics explore the sonic palette of strings and voice, with nods to the iconic originals as well as today’s cultural landscape, and the sound worlds of film scores, contemporary chamber music, fiddle, gospel, and more. These songs reflect on individual experiences of oppression and call us to join the collective work of liberation.

The series was created by the Duffer Brothers, who also serve as executive producers along with Shawn Levy and Dan Cohen. This season stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Cara Buono, and Matthew Modine, with Noah Schnapp, Joe Keery, and Shannon Purser in recurring roles. The first season of Stranger Things was widely praised, in particular for its originality, homages to the 1980s, characterization, tone, visuals, and acting (particularly those of Ryder, Harbour, Wolfhard, Brown and Modine).

      "The first season's original soundtrack, consisting of 75 songs from Dixon and Stein split across two volumes, was released by Lakeshore Records. Digital release and streaming options were released on August 10 and 19, 2016 for the two volumes, respectively, while retail versions were available on September 16 and 23, 2016. In addition to original music, Stranger Things features period music from artists including The Clash, Toto, New Order, The Bangles, Foreigner, Echo and the Bunnymen, Peter Gabriel and Corey Hart, as well as excerpts from Tangerine Dream, John Carpenter and Vangelis. In particular, The Clash's 'Should I Stay or Should I Go' was specifically picked to play at pivotal moments of the story, such as when Will is trying to communicate with Joyce from the Upside Down. Music supervisor Nora Felder felt the song 'furthered the story' and called it an additional, unseen, main character of the season. Release As Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the season based on people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, within the first 35 days of release, Stranger Things averaged ratings of around 14.07 million adults between the ages of 18 and 49 in the United States. This made it the third most-watched season of Netflix original content in the U.S. at the time behind the first season of Fuller House and fourth season of Orange Is the New Black. In a September 2016 analysis, Netflix found that Stranger Things 'hooked' viewers by the second episode of the first season, indicating that the second episode was 'the first installment that led at least 70 percent of viewers who watched that episode to complete the entire first season of a show.' \n",

      "Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 97% based on 92 reviews and a weighted average score of 8.2/10. The site's critical consensus states, 'Exciting, heartbreaking, and sometimes scary, Stranger Things acts as an addictive homage to Spielberg films and vintage 1980s television.' Review aggregator Metacritic gave the first season a normalized score of 76 out of 100 based on 34 reviews, indicating 'generally favorable reviews'. \n",

      "We’re technically entering the endgame of this part of season 4 now, though the next episode is 73 minutes long, and episode 7 is 100 minutes(!!!). It makes sense to complain that we’re spending so much time with seemingly insignificant plot threads like, for instance, the basketball team’s torment of Eddie. But at the same time, with such long episodes to come, things could change within a single installment. That doesn’t change the fact that 'The Nina Project' is somewhere in the middle of the show’s spectrum, between the thrilling horror of 'Dear Billy' and the dull tediousness of 'Vecna’s Curse'. 7 Episodes of Stranger Things are available on Netflix now.

      "After seven years, Stranger Things is readying to say goodbye. And on Nov. 6 (when this story first published) — Netflix’s annual Stranger Things Day — what better way to mark the notable date in the world of the Upside Down than by cataloguing everything we know about the final season? (On Nov. 6, 1983, Will Byers went missing in Hawkins, Indiana.) When the sci-fi series hit Netflix in July 2016, it became an unexpected cultural phenomenon. The stars, many of whom landed their first major roles with this show, were barely preteens, and the draw for many was Winona Ryder. (The Hollywood Reporter angled its review as 'Winona Ryder in Stranger Things.') Since then, however, Stranger Things has broken several Netflix records. Season four of the now-hit series set a Nielsen record for the most watched show ever at the time, racking up more than 7 billion minutes of viewing time in a single week. It was also the most streamed series of the entire year. \n",

Image Credit: Courtesy of Netflix Logo text Prior to the dual actors and writers strikes, Stranger Things season five was expected to premiere sometime in early 2025, according to star Finn Wolfhard. In a GQ video, the actor said that he would be 22 when season five finally hit Netflix. The eyed date lined up with what the Duffer brothers had said in 2022 about the time between seasons four and five being much shorter than the break between seasons three and four because they weren’t expecting another six-month hiatus like the one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
