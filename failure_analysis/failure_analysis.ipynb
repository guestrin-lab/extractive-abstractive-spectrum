      "Firearms regulation in Switzerland allows the acquisition of semi-automatic, and – with a may-issue permit – fully automatic firearms, by Swiss citizens and foreigners with or without permanent residence.[note 1] The laws pertaining to the acquisition of firearms in Switzerland are amongst the most liberal in the world. Swiss gun laws are primarily about the acquisition of arms, and not ownership. As such a license is not required to own a gun by itself, but a shall-issue permit is required to purchase most types of firearms. Bolt-action rifles do not require an acquisition permit, and can be acquired with just a background check. A reason is not required to be issued an acquisition permit for semi-automatics unless the reason is other than sport-shooting, hunting, or collecting. Permits for concealed carrying in public are issued sparingly.[note 2] The acquisition of fully automatic weapons, suppressors and target lasers requires special permits issued by the cantonal firearms office. Police use of hollow point ammunition is limited to special situations. \n",
      "The number of registered firearms in thoses databases was reported as 876,000 as of August 2017 which given a population of 8.4 million corresponds to around 10.3 registered guns per 100 residents. Regulation Switzerland's Weapons Law (WG, LArm) and Weapons Act (WV, OArm) has been revised to accede to the Schengen Treaty effective 12 December 2008, and modified in 2019 after a referendum from the Swiss population to implement the European Firearms Directive which was added in the Schengen agreement. The Act on Personal Military Equipment (VPAA, OEPM) governs the handling of military equipment, and in particular the handling of personal weapons by military personnel. The law is applied to the following weapons: Firearms, such as pistols, revolvers, rifles, pump guns (German: Vorderschaftrepetierer), lever-action rifles, self-loading guns (shotguns and rifles). Air and CO2 guns with a muzzle energy of at least 7.5 joules, or if there is risk of confusion with a firearm. \n",
      "In order to purchase most weapons, the purchaser must obtain a weapon acquisition permit (art. 8 WG/LArm). Swiss citizens and foreigners with a C permit over the age of 18 who are not under a curator nor identified as being a danger for themselves or others, and who do not have a criminal record with a conviction for a violent crime or of several convictions as long as they haven't been written out can request such a permit. Foreign nationals who do not have a settlement permit but who are resident in Switzerland must present the competent cantonal authority with an official attestation from their home country confirming they are authorised to acquire the weapon or essential weapon component in that country in order to buy (art. 9a WG/LArm). Foreigners with citizenship to the following countries are explicitly excluded from the right to buy, sell and own weapons and their parts unless they ask for an exceptional authorization to the state: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania.[note 1] \n",

      "The Big One: Curriculum Search       Contact Us Curriculum Back to Background Material The Pacific Northwest Three types of earthquakes occur in the Pacific Northwest: subduction, deep, and shallow (or surface). (Also described in Panel Text, pg. 3.) Interaction between the Juan de Fuca oceanic plate and the North America continental plate drives these faults. Because the Juan de Fuca is denser it slides under or subducts beneath North America. As it descends, the locking and unlocking of the two plate margins causes subduction quakes. Subduction quakes are usually massive with ground breaking occurring along hundreds of kilometers of the coastline. S hallow or crustal earthquakes are less related to subduction. Geologists believe they are mostly due to shortening within the crust or top layer of North America. Deep Quakes \n",
      "Although both seiches and tsunamis can be large and destructive, they are created differently. A seiche is a large ‘standing wave’ caused by the resonance of a particular period of wave energy. In effect, the wave energy is ‘trapped’ by the edges of the body of water. HISTORIC EARTHQUAKES IN WASHINGTON Since about 1870 there have been about 15 large earthquakes (greater than M5) in the state. Before modern record keeping, Native Americans lived in the Pacific Northwest for thousands of years. Story telling is an important part of the Native tradition and is how their history is passed down to the next generation. Within this rich oral history there are many references to events like earthquakes and tsunamis. \n",
      "The last huge earthquake, the last really 'Big One' to hit the Pacific Northwest Coast, struck around 9 p.m. on Jan. 26, 1700 — 321 years ago. Called Cascadia, the magnitude 9.0 quake caused the entire Pacific Northwest coastline to suddenly drop 3 to 6 feet and sent a 33-foot high tsunami across the ocean to Japan. 'Japanese sources document this earthquake, which is the earliest documented historical event in Western Washington. Other evidence includes drowned groves of red cedars and Sitka spruces in the Pacific Northwest. Indian legends corroborate the cataclysmic occurrence,' according to HistoryLink. The earthquake ruptured what is known as the Cascadia subduction zone from British Columbia to northern California — the area of overlap between two of the tectonic plates that make up the earth’s surface, the Juan de Fuca plate and the North American plate.

      "For 900 years, Jadis lived in the Wild Lands of the North, biding her time and gathering her forces for a great attack on Narnia. During this time, her witchcraft powers grew consistently stronger, and she even created a new magic wand, which would give her the power to turn anyone into stone. Jadis is known to have worked at other magical spells and inventions during this time as well. Eventually the Tree of Protection died, and when it did Jadis at last returned to the Kingdom of Narnia, and in the year of 900 she conquered the land and named herself The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands. She immediately put her centuries of magical study to work, fabricating a perpetual climate of snow and ice throughout the Kingdom, which not only oppressed the Narnian citizens, but also ensured that no more silver apple trees could be grown. The Hundred Year Winter During the one hundred years of Jadis's reign, the seasons of spring, summer and autumn were extinct during this Long Winter. She also famously banned the celebration of Christmas, her magic even able to keep Father Christmas out of the land. Jadis became known among the Narnians as the White Witch, and quickly secured absolute control over the nation, establishing the first Narnian Secret Police, and building herself a palace. She abolished any judicial system, merely punishing all of her political enemies by turning them into stone, and decorating their statuesque figures in her palace courtyard. The Witch also banned any humans from Narnia. This was done in retaliation to the Golden Age Prophecy, which stated that she would someday be overthrown by two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve. \n",
      "As a member of the royal family of Charn, Jadis had an inborn talent in magic, and was extraordinarily skilled in using it to defy the laws of nature, as well as to manipulate reality as she desired. As revealed by her in The Magician's Nephew, she had gone to terrible lengths to master the darkest secrets of magic, and possessed greater powers than her sister ever had. After eating an apple from the Tree of Youth, her magical strength and longevity were enhanced to a goddess-like level, and Aslan himself also confirmed that, during the time where he banished her to the North, she had grown consistently stronger in dark magic. When she resurfaced as the White Witch, her powers were such that they held Narnia in a constant winter, until Aslan returned a century later to end her tyranny.

      "A Wrinkle in Time First-edition dust jacketAuthorMadeleine L'EngleIllustratorEllen Raskin (1960s editions)LanguageEnglishGenreYoung adult, science fantasyPublisherAriel BooksPublication dateJanuary 1, 1962Publication placeUnited StatesOCLC22421788LC ClassPZ7.L5385 Wr 1962Followed byA Wind in the Door A Wrinkle in Time is a young adult science fantasy novel written by American author Madeleine L'Engle. First published in 1962, the book won the Newbery Medal, the Sequoyah Book Award, the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, and was runner-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Award.[a] The main characters – Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry, and Calvin O'Keefe – embark on a journey through space and time, from galaxy to galaxy, as they endeavor to rescue the Murrys' father and fight The Black Thing that has intruded into several worlds. The novel offers a glimpse into the war between light and darkness, and good and evil, as the young characters mature into adolescents on their journey, and wrestles with questions of spirituality and purpose, as the characters are often thrown into conflicts of love, divinity, and goodness. It is the first book in L'Engle's Time Quintet, which follows the Murry family and O'Keefe. L'Engle modeled the Murry family on her own. B. E. Cullinan noted that L'Engle created characters who 'share common joy with a mixed fantasy and science fiction setting'. The novel's scientific and religious undertones are therefore highly reflective of the life of L'Engle. The book has inspired a 2003 television film directed by John Kent Harrison, and a 2018 theatrical film directed by Ava DuVernay, both produced by The Walt Disney Company. Background \n",
      "L'Engle wrote A Wrinkle in Time between 1959 and 1960. In her memoir, L'Engle explains that the book was conceived 'during a time of transition'. After years of living in rural Goshen, Connecticut where they ran a general store, L'Engle's family, the Franklins, moved back to New York City, first taking a ten-week camping trip across the country. L'Engle writes that 'we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains, wholly new and alien to me. And suddenly into my mind came the names, Mrs Whatsit. Mrs Who. Mrs Which.' This was in the spring of 1959. When asked for more information in an interview with Horn Book magazine in 1983, L'Engle responded I cannot possibly tell you how I came to write it. It was simply a book I had to write. I had no choice. It was only after it was written that I realized what some of it meant. L'Engle has also described the novel as her 'psalm of praise to life, [her] stand for life against death.' \n",

      "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Speed test in American football The 40-yard dash is a sprint covering 40 yards (36.576 m). It is primarily run to evaluate the speed and acceleration of American football players by scouts, particularly for the NFL draft but also for collegiate recruiting. A player's recorded time can have a heavy impact on his prospects in college or professional football. This was traditionally only true for the 'skill' positions such as running back, wide receiver, and defensive back, although now a fast 40-yard dash time is considered important for almost every position. The 40-yard dash is not an official race in track and field athletics, and is not an IAAF-recognized race. \n",
      "1.40 seconds — Chris Johnson, RB, East Carolina, 2008. Drafted 24th overall by Tennessee, he ran for 2,006 yards and 14 TDs in 2009 and scored 55 times over a stellar 10-year career with the Titans, Jets and Cardinals. Whether prospects will eventually burn bright or flame out, fans needing their football fix between the Super Bowl and draft weekend can at least catch a glimpse of what's to come by watching what's known to many as the 'Underwear Olympics.'

      "The Heisman Trophy winner said that there wasn't enough room for him to run the distance properly. He didn't want to injure himself. According to Jackson, he pulled up with 10 yards to go. His first attempt came in at 4.3. ''They said, what if we open the back door?' My coach had come up to me and said, 'Give these guys what they want, run through the tape, and go on out the door, you don't have to stop, run through the finish line,'' Jackson said. 'I waited about five minutes to get my breath, and they had other people. I got down there, and I took off and ran completely through. I just kept going right out the door and didn't come back.' For those of us who recall Jackson running through the tunnel at the end of a 91-yard touchdown run at the Kingdome in Seattle a year and a half later, this 40-yard dash was a precursor of things to come. After numerous reports of hand-held stopwatch times of 3.9 and 4-flat among the scouts, Jackson said the official timer was consulted. \n",

      "\u001b[92m\"The desire to limit the power of government is closely related to the belief that people should govern themselves\" [1]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"For instance, Virginia established its House of Burgesses in 1619\" [2]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"Upon their arrival in North America a year later, the English Separatists who settled the Plymouth Colony, commonly known as the Pilgrims, promptly authored the Mayflower Compact, an agreement to govern themselves according to the laws created by the male voters of the colony\" [3]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "Perhaps the most important of Locke’s ideas that influenced the British settlers of North America were those regarding the origins and purpose of government. Most Europeans of the time believed the institution of monarchy had been created by God, and kings and queens had been divinely appointed to rule. Locke, however, theorized that human beings, not God, had created government. People sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government’s protection of their lives, liberty, and property. Locke called this implicit agreement between a people and their government the social contract. Should government deprive people of their rights by abusing the power given to it, the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms. The people could thus withdraw their consent to obey and form another government for their protection. The desire to limit the power of government is closely related to the belief that people should govern themselves. This core tenet of American political thought was rooted in a variety of traditions. First, the British government did allow for a degree of self-government. Laws were made by Parliament, and property-owning males were allowed to vote for representatives to Parliament. Thus, Americans were accustomed to the idea of representative government from the beginning. For instance, Virginia established its House of Burgesses in 1619. Upon their arrival in North America a year later, the English Separatists who settled the Plymouth Colony, commonly known as the Pilgrims, promptly authored the Mayflower Compact, an agreement to govern themselves according to the laws created by the male voters of the colony.[1] \n",
      "The Self-Government Era, was an era in which federal policies toward Native Americans began to change.  In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, a New Deal policy which gave Native Americans more power to self-govern.  As William Canby Jr. writes, 'The Indian Reorganization was based on the assumption, quite contrary to that of the Allotment Act, that the tribes not only would be in existence for an indefinite period, but that they should be.' William C. Canby, Jr., American Indian Law in a Nutshell 25 (6th ed., 2015). The Indian Reorganization Act effectively ended the previous era's policy of allotting land.  Additionally, surplus lands on reservations were returned to tribal ownership if they were not previously acquired by another entity.  This new policy of recognizing Native Americans and the land promised to them dramatically increased the ability of tribes to enhance their sovereignty. \n",
      "From these experiences came a uniquely American view of power and liberty as natural enemies. The nation’s founders believed that containing the government’s power and protecting liberty was their most important task, and declared a new purpose for government: the protection of individual rights. The protection of rights was not the government’s only purpose. It was still expected to protect the community against foreign and domestic threats, to ensure economic growth, and to conduct foreign affairs. It was not, however, the government’s job to tell people how to live their lives, what religion to believe in, or what to write about in a pamphlet or newspaper. In this sense, the idea of individual rights is the oldest and most traditional of American values. 'Certain Unalienable Rights' Democracy and liberty are often thought to be the same thing, but they are not. Democracy means that people ought to be able to vote for public officials in fair elections, and make most political decisions by majority rule.Liberty, on the other hand, means that even in a democracy, individuals have rights that no majority should be able to take away. The rights that the Constitution’s framers wanted to protect from government abuse were referred to in the Declaration of Independence as 'unalienable rights.' They were also called 'natural' rights, and to James Madison, they were 'the great rights of mankind.' Although it is commonly thought that we are entitled to free speech because the First Amendment gives it to us, this country’s original citizens believed that as human beings, they were entitled to free speech, and they invented the First Amendment in order to protect it. The entire Bill of Rights was created to protect rights the original citizens believed were naturally theirs, including: Freedom of Religion \n",
      "Constitution of the United States—A History A More Perfect Union: The Creation of the U.S. Constitution Enlarge General George Washington He was unanimously elected president of the Philadelphia convention. May 25, 1787, freshly spread dirt covered the cobblestone street in front of the Pennsylvania State House, protecting the men inside from the sound of passing carriages and carts. Guards stood at the entrances to ensure that the curious were kept at a distance. Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, the 'financier' of the Revolution, opened the proceedings with a nomination--Gen. George Washington for the presidency of the Constitutional Convention. The vote was unanimous. With characteristic ceremonial modesty, the general expressed his embarrassment at his lack of qualifications to preside over such an august body and apologized for any errors into which he might fall in the course of its deliberations. \n",
      "In 1786 some of the farmers had fought back. Led by Daniel Shays, a former captain in the Continental army, a group of armed men, sporting evergreen twigs in their hats, prevented the circuit court from sitting at Northampton, MA, and threatened to seize muskets stored in the arsenal at Springfield. Although the insurrection was put down by state troops, the incident confirmed the fears of many wealthy men that anarchy was just around the corner. Embellished day after day in the press, the uprising made upper-class Americans shudder as they imagined hordes of vicious outlaws descending upon innocent citizens. From his idyllic Mount Vernon setting, Washington wrote to Madison: 'Wisdom and good examples are necessary at this time to rescue the political machine from the impending storm.' \n",
      "This nationalist position revolted many delegates who cringed at the vision of a central government swallowing state sovereignty. On June 13 delegates from smaller states rallied around proposals offered by New Jersey delegate William Paterson. Railing against efforts to throw the states into 'hotchpot,' Paterson proposed a 'union of the States merely federal.' The 'New Jersey resolutions' called only for a revision of the articles to enable the Congress more easily to raise revenues and regulate commerce. It also provided that acts of Congress and ratified treaties be 'the supreme law of the States.' \n",
      "In the early days of September, with the exhausted delegates anxious to return home, compromise came easily. On September 8 the convention was ready to turn the Constitution over to a Committee of Style and Arrangement. Gouverneur Morris was the chief architect. Years later he wrote to Timothy Pickering: 'That Instrument was written by the Fingers which wrote this letter.' The Constitution was presented to the convention on September 12, and the delegates methodically began to consider each section. Although close votes followed on several articles, it was clear that the grueling work of the convention in the historic summer of 1787 was reaching its end. \n",
      "History & Political Status The Caribbean island chain known as the Virgin Islands was divided into two parts in the 17th century, one English and the other Danish.  The Danish part had been in economic decline for quite some time, owing to losses in sugarcane production after slavery was abolished in 1848.  In 1917, the United States purchased the Danish part for $25 million, mainly for strategic reasons to assure tranquility in the Caribbean Ocean.  U.S. citizenship was conferred on U.S. Virgin Islanders in 1927.  Federal authority over the new U.S. territory was placed in the Department of the Interior in 1931, where it resides.  The Organic Act of 1936 laid the foundation for self-government and a more elaborate governmental structure emerged from the revised Organic Act of 1954.  The first elections for constitutional officers were held in 1970. U.S.V.I.

      "Inevitably, Touya is dragged further into the politics of his new home, particularly when a prophecy sort-of promises nine nubile concubines, many of whom he has to rescue, woo and otherwise keep calm. Thank God he’s got a phone that lets him Google 'pissed-off sister-wives.' But he also has a burgeoning ability in magic, which seems to me to be a bit of a cop-out. I’d much rather have seen him quelling orc armies with a well-chosen ringtone, or using his apps to predict an eclipse or something, but instead there’s an awful amount of rules-lawyering as he tries out new spells and tries to remember how many copper coins are in a gold piece.

      "In the House of Representatives, the majority party holds significant power to draft chamber rules and schedule bills to reach the floor for debate and voting. In most cases, House rules will limit debate so that important legislation can be passed during one legislative business day.In the Senate however, the majority has the power to schedule when various bills come to the floor for voting but a single Senator can slow legislation from coming to the floor for a vote. Since debate in the Senate is not concluded until 60 senators vote for a cloture motion to approve a bill for consideration, the majority must also coordinate with the minority part to set the rules for debate on legislation. Under this system, legislation can be debated for one or two weeks on the Senate floor alone. Why does Congress use the committee system? Congress deals with a broad variety of different policy issues and it is more efficient to have work done at the committee level than on the House or Senate floor. In addition, this system allows members to gain expertise in specific issue areas they are interested in. Throughout history, committees have been created to address particular issues before Congress.

      "\u001b[1;31;60m\"Retinal ganglion cells are the cells whose axons form the optic nerve\" [1]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"The optic nerve is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glia\" [2]\u001b[0m. \u001b[95m\"The ganglion cell axons run in the nerve fiber layer above the inner limiting membrane towards the optic nerve head\" [3]\u001b[0m and \u001b[1;31;60m\"join together to form the optic nerve\" [4]\u001b[0m. This process is part of how \u001b[92m\"the fibers from the retina run along the optic nerve to nine primary visual nuclei in the brain\" [5]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "The optic nerve has been classified as the second of twelve paired cranial nerves, but it is technically a myelinated tract of the central nervous system, rather than a classical nerve of the peripheral nervous system because it is derived from an out-pouching of the diencephalon (optic stalks) during embryonic development. As a consequence, the fibers of the optic nerve are covered with myelin produced by oligodendrocytes, rather than Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, and are encased within the meninges. Peripheral neuropathies like Guillain–Barré syndrome do not affect the optic nerve. However, most typically, the optic nerve is grouped with the other eleven cranial nerves and is considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system. The optic nerve is ensheathed in all three meningeal layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia mater) rather than the epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium found in peripheral nerves. Fiber tracts of the mammalian central nervous system have only limited regenerative capabilities compared to the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, in most mammals, optic nerve damage results in irreversible blindness. The fibers from the retina run along the optic nerve to nine primary visual nuclei in the brain, from which a major relay inputs into the primary visual cortex. A fundus photograph showing the back of the retina. The white circle is the beginning of the optic nerve. The optic nerve is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glia. Each human optic nerve contains between 770,000 and 1.7 million nerve fibers, which are axons of the retinal ganglion cells of one retina. In the fovea, which has high acuity, these ganglion cells connect to as few as 5 photoreceptor cells; in other areas of the retina, they connect to thousands of photoreceptors. The optic nerve leaves the orbit (eye socket) via the optic canal, running postero-medially towards the optic chiasm, where there is a partial decussation (crossing) of fibers from the temporal visual fields (the nasal hemi-retina) of both eyes. The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species, and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species. Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex, while other axons terminate in the pretectal area and are involved in reflexive eye movements. Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. Its diameter increases from about 1.6 mm within the eye to 3.5 mm in the orbit to 4.5 mm within the cranial space. The optic nerve component lengths are 1 mm in the globe, 24 mm in the orbit, 9 mm in the optic canal, and 16 mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm. There, partial decussation occurs, and about 53% of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts. Most of these fibers terminate in the lateral geniculate body. Based on this anatomy, the optic nerve may be divided into four parts as indicated in the image at the top of this section (this view is from above as if you were looking into the orbit after the top of the skull had been removed): 1. the optic head (which is where it begins in the eyeball (globe) with fibers from the retina); 2. orbital part (which is the part within the orbit); 3. intracanicular part (which is the part within a bony canal known as the optic canal); and, 4. cranial part (the part within the cranial cavity, which ends at the optic chiasm). \n",
      "As noted previously in the somatosensory sections, all sensory information must reach the cerebral cortex to be perceived and, with one exception, reach the cortex by way of the thalamus. In the case of the visual system, the thalamic nucleus is the lateral geniculate nucleus and the cortex is the striate cortex of the occipital lobe. The Optic Nerve Figure 15.1 The visual pathway with the course of information flow from the right (green) and left (blue) hemifields of the two eye's visual fields. The axons of the 3° visual afferents (the retinal ganglion cells) form the optic nerve fiber layer of the retina on their course to the optic disc. At the optic disc, the 3° visual afferents exit the eye and form the optic nerve. The fibers of the optic nerve that originate from ganglion cells in the nasal half of the retina (i.e., the nasal hemiretina) decussate in the optic chiasm to the opposite optic tract (Figure 15.1). Consequently, each optic tract contains retinal ganglion cell axons that originate in the nasal half of the contralateral retina and the temporal half of the ipsilateral retina. Recall that the ipsilateral temporal hemiretina and the contralateral nasal hemiretina have projected on them the images of corresponding halves of their visual fields. For example, the temporal (left) hemiretina of left eye and the nasal (left) hemiretina of right eye both have projected on them the right halves of their respective visual fields. Consequently, each optic tract has within it axons representing the contralateral half of the visual field. The axons in the optic tract terminate in four nuclei within the brain (Figure 15.2): the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus - for visual perception; the superior colliculus of the midbrain - for control of eye movements; the pretectum of the midbrain - for control of the pupillary light reflex; and \n",
      "The ganglion cell axons run in the nerve fiber layer above the inner limiting membrane towards the optic nerve head in a arcuate form (Fig. 00, streaming pink fibers).  The fovea is, of course, free of a nerve fiber layer as the inner retina and ganglion cells are pushed away to the foveal slope.  The central ganglion cell fibers run around the foveal slope and sweep in the direction of the optic nerve.  Peripheral ganglion cell axons continue this arcing course to the optic nerve with a dorso/ventral split along the horizontal meridian (Fig. 00).  Retinal topography is maintained in the optic nerve, through the lateral geniculate to the visual cortex. Fig. 00.  Schematic representation of the course of ganglion cell axons in the retina.  The retinotopic origin of these nerve fibers is respected throughout the visual pathway.  (Modified from Harrington DO, Drake MV.  The visual fields.  6th ed. St. Louis: CV Mosby; 1990, with permission) 7. Blood supply to the retina. \n",
      "In between the sclera and the retina, there are some supportive tissues. I will return to them later, because the interplay between the retina and the surrounding structures is critical to important pathologies of the retina. Retinal ganglion cells are the cells whose axons form the optic nerve. They line the anterior surface of the retina. Their axons run across the retinal surface and then join together to form the optic nerve. I will come back later to the reasons why the retina is arranged as it is. \n",
      "The axons were separated by astrocyte processes (pale, with bundles of 10 nm filaments) and by oligodendrocyte processes (dark, with microtubules but not filaments). Astrocyte processes occupied 12% of the area, and their somas occupied 16%; oligodendrocyte processes occupied 8% of the area, and their somas occupied 5%. Extracellular space was 2%. Our sample did not include microglia (Peters et al., 1991). Of course, astrocytes are a common constituent of central tracts, but it surprised us to learn that in the optic nerve, they occupy such a large fraction (nearly 30%) of the total cross-section (Fig. 1C). \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[92m\"Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts\" [1]\u001b[0m. \u001b[1;35;40m\"In making history the masses have traversed a course of gradually developing from being unaware to being aware\" [2]\u001b[0m. \u001b[1;35;40m\"The mass line formulated by Chairman Mao for our Party requires us to have faith in the masses, to rely on them, respect their initiative, learn wholeheartedly from them and, at the same time, to indefatigably educate them in Marxism-Leninism, steadily raise their level of political consciousness and lead them to forge ahead\" [3]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "Hoffer states that mass movements begin with a widespread 'desire for change' from discontented people who place their locus of control outside their power and who also have no confidence in existing culture or traditions. Feeling their lives are 'irredeemably spoiled' and believing there is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual, true believers seek 'self-renunciation'. Thus, such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives in a larger collective. Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts. While mass movements are usually some blend of nationalist, political and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: 'All mass movements are competitive' and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and 'all mass movements are interchangeable'. As examples of the interchangeable nature of mass movements, Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for the same type of angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals. Part 2. The Potential Converts \n",
      "Mass movements demand a 'total surrender of a distinct self'. One identifies the most as 'a member of a certain tribe or family,' whether religious, political, revolutionary, or nationalist. Every important part of the true believer's persona and life must ultimately come from their identification with the larger community; even when alone, the true believer must never feel isolated and unwatched. Hoffer identifies this communal sensibility as the reappearance of a 'primitive state of being' common among pre-modern cultures. Mass movements also use play-acting and spectacle designed to make the individual feel overwhelmed and awed by their membership in the tribe, as with the massive ceremonial parades and speeches of the Nazis. \n",
      "Fanaticism is encouraged in mass movements. Hoffer argues that 'the fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure' and thus uses uncompromising action and personal sacrifice to give meaning to his life. Part 4. Beginning and End Hoffer identifies three main personality types as the leaders of mass movements, 'men of words', 'fanatics', and 'practical men of action'. No person falls exclusively into one category, and their predominant quality may shift over time. Mass movements begin with 'men of words' or 'fault-finding intellectuals' such as clergy, journalists, academics, and students who condemn the established social order (such as Trotsky, Mohammed, and Lenin). The men of words feel unjustly excluded from or mocked and oppressed by the existing powers in society, and they relentlessly criticize or denigrate present institutions. Invariably speaking out in the name of disadvantaged commoners, the man of words is actually motivated by a deep personal grievance. The man of words relentlessly attempts to 'discredit the prevailing creeds' and creates a 'hunger for faith' which is then fed by 'doctrines and slogans of the new faith'. A cadre of devotees gradually develops around the man of words, leading to the next stage in a mass movement. Eventually, the fanatic takes over leadership of the mass movement from the man of words. While the 'creative man of words' finds satisfaction in his literature, philosophy or art, the 'noncreative man of words' feels unrecognized or stifled and thus veers into an extremism against the social order. Though the man of words and the fanatic share a discontent with the world, the fanatic is distinguished by his viciousness and urge to destroy. The fanatic feels fulfilled only in a perpetual struggle for power and change. Examples include Jean-Paul Marat, Maximilien de Robespierre, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. \n",
      "The focus shifts from immediate demands for revolution to establishing the mass movement as a social institution where the ambitious can find influence and fame. Leadership uses an eclectic bricolage of ideological scraps to reinforce the doctrine, borrowing from whatever source is successful in holding the attention of true believers. For example, proto-Christians were fanatics, predicting the end of the world, condemning idolatry, demanding celibacy and sowing discontent between family members, yet from those roots grew Roman Catholicism, which mimicked the elaborate bureaucratic structure of the Roman Empire, canonized early Christians as saints, and borrowed pagan holidays and rites. In the absence of a practical man of action, the mass movement often withers and dies with the fanatic (Nazism died as a viable mass movement with Hitler's death). There are, of course, rare leaders such as Lincoln, Gandhi, even F.D.R., Churchill, and Nehru. They do not hesitate to harness man's hungers and fears to weld a following and make it zealous unto death in service of a holy cause; but unlike a Hitler, a Stalin, or even a Luther and a Calvin, they are not tempted to use the slime of frustrated souls as mortar in the building of a new world.... They know that no one can be honorable unless he honors mankind'.— p. 147 Hoffer argues that the length of the 'active phase' of a mass movement, the most energetic phase when fanatics are in control, can be predicted with some accuracy. Mass movements with a specific goal tend to be shorter-lived and feature less terror and bloodshed (such as the American Revolution). In contrast, an amorphous goal tends to result in a longer active phase of decades rather than months or years and also include substantially more bloodshed (such as the Bolsheviks in Russia, National Socialism in Germany). \n",
      "Leaders of mass movements provide direction that gives shape to popular discontent. In addition to organizing the masses, their key task is to formulate an alternative policy proposal or reform agenda to rally support among dissatisfied citizens to replace the status quo. However, the interests of leaders and their followers are seldom the same. First, the preferences of different individuals are naturally different: some prefer radical solutions, while others prefer more moderate ones. In addition, the stakes are much higher for leaders, and the possible sanctions they face are also higher. Furthermore, leaders are well informed about the political situation because they are specialized political actors, while the masses are generally less informed because the extent of their involvement in the movement is much smaller. These systematic differences present an agency problem in the relationship between leaders and their followers. In this paper, we analyze how this agency problem may distort the reform agenda of opposition leaders. \n",
      "In making history the masses have traversed a course of gradually developing from being unaware to being aware. The founding of the Marxist materialist conception of history showed the objective laws of the development of society and history, bringing the role of the masses in making history to a new stage and opening up a broad avenue for mankind to leave the realm of necessity in which man is blindly at the disposal of history and enter the realm of freedom in which man will consciously handle history. As Chairman Mao has put it, 'The epoch of world communism will be reached when all mankind voluntarily and consciously changes itself and the world.' So that this day will come the proletariat and revolutionary people still need to go through arduous and tortuous struggles, which must be led by a proletarian political party if it is to win victory. The mass line formulated by Chairman Mao for our Party requires us to have faith in the masses, to rely on them, respect their initiative, learn wholeheartedly from them and, at the same time, to indefatigably educate them in Marxism-Leninism, steadily raise their level of political consciousness and lead them to forge ahead. Lenin said: 'A party is the vanguard of a class, and its duty is to lead the masses and not merely to reflect the average political level of the masses.' (The Extraordinary All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies. [LCW 26:324]) Uphold the Marxist principle that the masses are the makers of history and adhere to the Party leadership—this is the only way to ensure that our revolutionary cause will continue to move ahead victoriously along the correct path. _______________ \n",

      "The parashah is a section of the Torah (Five Books of Moses) used in Jewish liturgy during a particular week. There are 54 parshas, or parashiyot in Hebrew, and the full cycle is read over the course of one Biblical year. Content and number Each Torah portion consists of two to six chapters to be read during the week. There are 54 weekly portions or parashot. Torah reading mostly follows an annual cycle beginning and ending on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, with the divisions corresponding to the lunisolar Hebrew calendar, which contains up to 55 weeks, the exact number varying between leap years and regular years. There are some deviations to the cyclic regularity noted above, all related to the week of Passover and the week of Sukkot. For both holidays, the first day of the holiday may fall on a Sabbath, in which case the Torah reading consists of a special portion relevant to the holiday rather than a portion in the normal cyclical sequence. When either holiday does not begin on a Sabbath, yet a different 'out of cycle' portion is read on the Sabbath within the holiday week. Immediately following Sukkot is the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. In Israel, this holiday coincides with Simchat Torah; in the Jewish Diaspora, Simchat Torah is celebrated on the day following Shemini Atzeret. If Shemini Atzeret falls on a Sabbath, in the Diaspora a special 'out of cycle' Torah reading is inserted for that day. The final parashah, V'Zot HaBerachah, is always read on Simchat Torah. Apart from this 'immovable' final portion, there can be up to 53 weeks available for the other 53 portions. In years with fewer than 53 available weeks, some readings are combined so as to fit into the needed number of weekly readings. The annual completion of the Torah readings on Simchat Torah, translating to 'Rejoicing of the Torah', is marked by Jewish communities around the world. Name Each weekly Torah portion takes its name from the first distinctive word or two in the Hebrew text of the portion in question, often from the first verse. Practice: who, when, what The appropriate parashah is chanted publicly. In most communities, it is read by a designated reader (ba'al koreh) in Jewish prayer services, starting with a partial reading on the afternoon of Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. Saturday afternoon, again during the Monday and Thursday morning services, and ending with a full reading during the following Shabbat morning services (Saturday morning). The weekly reading is pre-empted by a special reading on major religious holidays. Each Saturday morning and holiday reading is followed by an often similarly themed reading (Haftarah) from the Book of Prophets (Nevi'im). Origin The custom dates to the time of the supposed Babylonian captivity (6th century BCE). The origin of the first public Torah readings is found in the Book of Nehemiah, where Ezra the scribe writes about wanting to find a way to ensure the Israelites would not go astray again. This led to the creation of a weekly system to read the portions of the Torah at synagogues. Alternative triennial cycle In ancient times some Jewish communities practiced a triennial cycle of readings.[citation needed] In the 19th and 20th centuries, many congregations in the Reform and Conservative Jewish movements implemented an alternative triennial cycle in which only one-third of each weekly parashah was read in a given year; and this pattern continues. The parashot read are still consistent with the annual cycle, but the entire Torah is completed over three years. Orthodox Judaism does not follow this practice. Differences between Israel and the diaspora Due to different lengths of holidays in Israel and the Diaspora, the portion that is read on a particular week will sometimes not be the same inside and outside Israel. Differences between communities While the Parshyot divisions are fairly standardized, there are various communities with differing parsha divisions. \n",

      "portions are commonly doubled up so we can always read the entire Torah in the year. We read the last parshah right before a holiday called Simchat Torah (Rejoicing in the Law), which occurs in October, a few weeks after Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year). On Simchat Torah, we read the last few verses of Deuteronomy, and proceed immediately to the first paragraph of Genesis, showing that the Torah is a circle, and never ends. The weekly parshah is accompanied by a passage from the prophets, which is referred to as a haftarah (הַפְטָרָה). Contrary to common misconception, 'haftarah' does not mean 'half-Torah.' The word comes from the Hebrew root Fei-Teit-Reish (פטר) and means 'Conclusion.' Usually, the haftarah portion is quite short and has some relation to the Torah portion of the week, though sometimes the portion is special for the date or time of year. Tradition teaches that haftarah portions began in a time when studying Torah was forbidden, so instead we read thematically related portions from the prophets to remind us of what the week's Torah portion would have been. The haftarah also shows us that the concepts discussed in the Torah portion were not limited to that one time but continued through Jewish history. A reading applies to the whole week. Children may review it on Sunday in Hebrew School. A small taste of the week's Torah reading is read during morning services on Monday and Thursday. But the big deal is on the last day of the week, Shabbat, when the Torah and haftarah readings are the centerpiece of the morning service. The Torah and haftarah readings are performed with great ceremony: the Torah scroll is paraded around the room with song, while members of the congregation touch the cover and kiss their fingers as it passes by, before it is brought to rest on the bimah (podium). On Shabbat, the reading is divided up into seven portions (appropriate for this holy 7th day), and various members of the congregation have the honor of reciting a blessing over a portion of the reading. This honor is referred to as an aliyah (עֲלִיָּה, literally, ascension). When two Torah portions are combined, as they commonly are, there are still seven aliyot, dividing the text up differently. There is also an eighth aliyah and portion called a maftir (מַפְטִיר, from the same פטר root as haftarah, meaning 'the one that concludes'), which usually repeats part of the seventh portion but is sometimes an additional piece for a holiday or time of year and usually puts a second or third Torah scroll in that initial procession. The first aliyah of any day's reading is reserved for a kohein, the second for a Levite, and priority for subsequent aliyot are given to people celebrating major life events, such as marriage or the birth of a child.

      "The weekly Torah portion, parshat hashavuah (also spelled parashat hashavuah) serves as the focal point for much Jewish learning, from individual study to informal discussion groups to rabbis’ sermons. The Torah, also known as the Five Books of Moses or the Pentateuch, is divided into 54 separate portions, each one named for the first word or words of the passage — and each linked to a specific week. The weekly portion is read aloud, or chanted, from the Torah scroll as part of the Torah service in synagogue on Shabbat (Saturday) morning.The Torah is part of the Tanach, or Hebrew Bible, known in Christianity as the Old Testament.

      "\u001b[92m\"The California Gold Rush began with the discovery of significant gold deposits near Sacramento in 1848\" [1]\u001b[0m, and \u001b[96m\"brought approximately 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad\" [2]\u001b[0m.

Additionally, \u001b[0;33;47m\"the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill on January 24, 1848 unleashed the largest migration in United States history and drew people from a dozen countries to form a multi-ethnic society on America's fringe\" [6]\u001b[0m. Finally, \u001b[0;34;47m\"the California Gold Rush encouraged people to move westward in hopes that they’d strike it rich\" [7]\u001b[0m. \u001b[0;34;47m\"It largely influenced the growth of California’s major cities and urged the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad that linked the east coast of the US to the West\" [8]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "The California Gold Rush began with the discovery of significant gold deposits near Sacramento in 1848. As accounts of the discovery spread, residents of the thinly-populated West Coast poured into the gold fields and migrants swarmed in from the Far East, Mexico, South America, and the East Coast – which provided about 80 percent of the newcomers. The rush occurred because the gold mining industry was very labor intensive and was easy to enter due to modest capital requirements and laws which made acquiring a claim stake fairly simple. Many easterners went overland in wagon trains through undeveloped territory – a trip that took from April or May until September and cost around $200 at a time when laborers earned somewhat less than one dollar per day in the East. Others came by ship – either sailing around South America or sailing to Panama, crossing the isthmus, and then boarding another ship to San Francisco. The trip via Central America took six to eight weeks, but was very dangerous due to disease, an issue that abated when Cornelius Vanderbilt forged a path through Nicaragua in 1851 and William Henry Aspinwall completed a railroad across the Panamian isthmus in 1855. Sailing around Cape Horn could take from three to eight months depending on winds. After the arduous trip miners faced shockingly high prices for food, supplies, rent and other goods and services and endured mining camps that lacked basic sanitation. \n",
      "The California gold rush (1848–1855) was a gold rush that began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought approximately 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy; the sudden population increase allowed California to go rapidly to statehood in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population's decline from disease, starvation, and the California genocide. \n",
      "It is estimated that approximately 90,000 people arrived in California in 1849—about half by land and half by sea. Of these, perhaps 50,000 to 60,000 were Americans, and the rest were from other countries. By 1855, it is estimated at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world. The largest group continued to be Americans, but there were tens of thousands each of Mexicans, Chinese, Britons, Australians, French, and Latin Americans, together with many smaller groups of miners, such as African Americans, Filipinos, Basques and Turks. People from small villages in the hills near Genova, Italy were among the first to settle permanently in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters. A modest number of miners of African ancestry (probably less than 4,000) had come from the Southern States, the Caribbean and Brazil. \n",
      "When the Gold Rush began, the California goldfields were peculiarly lawless places. When gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, California was still technically part of Mexico, under American military occupation as the result of the Mexican–American War. With the signing of the treaty ending the war on February 2, 1848, California became a possession of the United States, but it was not a formal 'territory' and did not become a state until September 9, 1850. California existed in the unusual condition of a region under military control. There was no civil legislature, executive or judicial body for the entire region. Local residents operated under a confusing and changing mixture of Mexican rules, American principles, and personal dictates. Lax enforcement of federal laws, such as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, encouraged the arrival of free blacks and escaped slaves. \n",
      "Large-scale agriculture (California's second 'Gold Rush') began during this time. Roads, schools, churches, and civic organizations quickly came into existence. The vast majority of the immigrants were Americans. Pressure grew for better communications and political connections to the rest of the United States, leading to statehood for California on September 9, 1850, in the Compromise of 1850 as the 31st state of the United States. \n",
      "From December 1861 to January 1862, California was struck by the greatest flood period in the state's history. Weeks of constant rainfall and heavy snowfall in the Sierras turned California into a flood-ravaged sea. While the entire state was underwater, Sacramento suffered the worst. Over 200,000 head of cattle were lost in these floods, destroying California's most profitable industry. Following the devastation, Californians rebuilt their homes and businesses, but the ranching industry could not recover from the loss of cattle. It wasn't until the 'Big Four'– ambitious businessmen and politicians Charles Crocker, California Governor Leland Stanford, Collis Huntington, and Mark Hopkins – founded the Central Pacific Railroad in 1861 that new industries began to take hold in California. Connecting the West Coast to East, the Transcontinental Railroad stretched from Sacramento to Iowa, where it met up with existing railroads branched throughout the East. \n",
      "California experienced a second economic 'gold rush' after World War II ended in 1945. People flocked to the Golden State, attracted by its climate and lure of new jobs. Businesses and tract housing developments quickly multiplied, especially in larger metropolitan areas such as San Francisco and Los Angeles. The increased population and commerce made it clear to local water officials that their local water supplies alone would not meet their communities' future needs. Groundwater basins were also being rapidly depleted to irrigate the increasing acreage needed to grow food and fiber for a growing population. \n",
      "The discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill on January 24, 1848 unleashed the largest migration in United States history and drew people from a dozen countries to form a multi-ethnic society on America's fringe. The promise of wealth forever altered the life expectations of the hundreds of thousands of people who flooded California in 1849 and the decade that followed. The gold also fired up the U.S. economy and fueled wild dreams like the construction of a cross-country railroad line. War with Mexico When the United States and Mexico went to war in 1846, California was under the loose control of the Mexican government. California's population consisted of about 6,500 Californios (people of Spanish or Mexican decent), 700 foreigners (primarily Americans), and 150,000 Native Americans, whose numbers had been cut in half since the arrival of the Spanish in 1769. The Californios lived on vast ranches that had been granted by the Mexican government. Before the Discovery of Gold \n",
      "Gold was discovered in California in the late 1840s, and it caused a mass migration to the soon-to-be state. The California Gold Rush encouraged people to move westward in hopes that they’d strike it rich. It largely influenced the growth of California’s major cities and urged the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad that linked the east coast of the US to the West. The large influx of people from all around the world also influenced restrictions on immigration to the states as xenophobia worsened. Once the excitement of gold hunting calmed, people settled in the state, established businesses, and began farming to make ends meet. Events Leading Up to the California Gold Rush Illustration depicting the Mexican War of Independence, via Texas State Historical Association California was in a transitional period prior to the discovery of gold. Spain had ownership of the land up until the end of the Mexican War of Independence in 1821. As Spain was at the height of political turmoil in the early 19th century, the people of Mexico seized the opportunity of Spain’s fragile state to seek independence. Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla is largely responsible for sparking the revolution when he called for Mexican independence in a speech called the Grito de Dolores in September 1810. \n",

It was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Miguel Sapochnik. Cersei Lannister plots to destroy all her immediate enemies with one swift stroke; Jon Snow is declared King in the North by the lords of the Northern houses; Bran Stark learns that Jon is actually the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen; Samwell Tarly arrives at the Citadel; and Daenerys Targaryen begins heading to Westeros alongside Tyrion Lannister, her entire army, her three dragons, as well as the Ironborn loyal to Yara Greyjoy, the Tyrells, the Sand Snakes, and their respective fleets. \n",
      "Game of Thrones concluded what's arguably its best season with one of its finest — and the bloodiest — episodes, 'The Winds of Winter', which excelled in dramatic storytelling just as last week's 'Battle of the Bastards' raised the bar for action sequences. Though the finale shifted from the battlefield, the events were, if anything, far more seismic, with game-changing revelations and huge moves from every corner of the realm that established some very clear new conflicts going into season 7. Just look at all that happened in those 69 minutes: Dany set sail for Westeros, Dorne joined forces with both Dany and the Tyrells, Arya returned to Westeros and crossed a major name off her list, Jon became King in the North, and Cersei blew up her enemies and then claimed the Iron Throne for herself. There was death and destruction galore, but it was also rather gleeful death and destruction, as favorite characters mostly got exactly what they wanted. — James Hibberd, Entertainment Weekly \n",

Behind the scenes[] General[] The episode title is a reference to the name of the unpublished sixth novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter. The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of Daenerys's theme. On the official soundtrack release it is titled 'The Winds of Winter.' With a run time of 68 minutes, this episode was the longest of the television series until it was dethroned by 'Beyond the Wall,' three minutes longer at 71 minutes. \n",
      "Season 6 continues the show tradition of killing off at least one king per season: Season 1 -Robert Baratheon; Season 2 - Renly Baratheon; Season 3 - Robb Stark; Season 4 - Joffrey; Season 5 - Mance Rayder and Stannis Baratheon; Season 6 - Balon Greyjoy and Tommen. The number of recurring characters who were killed in this episode (eleven) is greater than in any of the former episodes. Of those, only two characters have died by the point the books reached - Kevan and Pycelle, both killed by Varys in the epilogue of the fifth book; Loras was horrifically harmed during the siege of Dragonstone in the novels, but he is still alive. The episode confirms two fan theories about the novels: the theory that Jon is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, and about the pies which Lord Manderly brought to Ramsay's wedding feast. Both were heavily implied but they haven't been outright confirmed yet. \n",
      "Early casting calls for Season 6 seem to indicate that Lord Manderly would actually have given the speech in the original version - perhaps revealing that he had been a staunch Stark supporter all along (because 'the North remembers') as he was in the novels. The final aired version simply has all of the vassals apologize for not following the Starks earlier - when in the books it was a major thematic point that they kept fighting for the Starks, because the Starks' honor had earned them undying loyalty from their vassals, while the Boltons' atrocities had alienated all of them. The exact report from WatchersOnTheWall.com stated: 'He is a fat nobleman in his 60’s. He has distinctive rugged features, a Northern accent, and a distinguished air. Our source says he has a stirring speech during which he unexpectedly shifts political allegiance.[14] \n",

      "Finally, the last scene of season six is Daenerys finally getting on her way to Westeros. This is actually pretty cool and suitably epic, though I do wonder how the Dothraki suddenly all look like expert sailors. Also, I didn’t notice it the first time I watched because I was wondering how Varys teleported back so quickly, but some of the ships have the Dornish sun on their sails, so it’s not just Varys who got back inexplicably quickly; it’s a whole fleet of ships that teleported in. The dragons still look cool, and I guess we’re in for a bunch of epic battles going forward with a pared down cast and basically nothing left for the show to do but have all-out war. The real question, though, is how are they going to squeeze in more brothel scenes now? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Miscellaneous Thoughts That fabric on Margaery’s dress is incredible. I love how Pycelle actually tries to fight those kids off, so we got to see an old dude punch a couple of little kids in the face. \n",
      "For a show that boasts some of the best music on television, somehow Game of Thrones managed to up the ante even more in the Season 6 finale. Right from the first scene, and right up until the last, just about every bit was simply gorgeous. An almost mournful piano greets us in the High Sept. Later, during Cersei's coronation, the urgent rise and fall of strings, dark and moody. The episode deserves awards based on its music alone. Update: Here's that opening piano number. Feast your ears! Of course, it was during the trial of Loras Tyrell that I first noticed just how striking the score was, so we'll follow our ears, through the city streets and up the steps, pitter patter, to the High Sept.

      "Previous Olympics: 2018 Events: Men’s singles The biggest name in U.S. figure skating – and one of the biggest names of the last two Olympic cycles – Nathan Chen has won almost every title on the planet, but still has one last box to check: earning singles gold at the Games. At PyeongChang 2018, Chen took a hard spill into 17th place during the short program; even a stunning, first-place free skate wasn’t enough to propel him onto the podium. After PyeongChang, Chen went on a three-and-a-half-year winning streak. He fell during the short program at 2021 Skate America, but still earned bronze; during his second 2021-22 Grand Prix assignment, Skate Canada, Chen rebounded with another golden performance. Though he fell during his free skate at the 2022 Nationals, his performance was strong enough to earn him his sixth consecutive U.S. Championships title. Only nerves and Japan’s famous Yuzuru Hanyu can prevent Chen from finally claiming the crown jewel of his career at the 2022 Winter Olympics. Zachary Donohue Age: 31 Previous Olympics: 2018 Events: Ice dance Zachary Donohue, one half of one of the two best ice dancing teams in the United States, didn’t start skating until he was 10 years old. It took another decade before he teamed up with current partner, Madison Hubbell. Since the 2011-2012 season, he and Hubbell have won the 2018 Grand Prix Final, three World Championship medals, and the U.S. Championships title three times. The duo competed at PyeongChang 2018, but finished fourth – just 0.02 points behind compatriots Alex and Maia Shibutani. Hubbell and Donohue recently announced that the 2021-22 season would be their last. Having punched their ticket to the Olympics, can they finally clinch an ice dancing medal that barely escaped them four years ago? Brandon Frazier Age: 29 Previous Olympics: N/A Events: Pairs \n",
      "Now, after more than a decade as partners, Hubbell/Donohue have announced that the 2021-22 season would be their last. Their brilliant career has included two silvers and a bronze at the World Championships, three national titles, and an appearance at the PyeongChang 2018 Games. They placed fourth at the most recent Games – just 4.90 points from a bronze medal. Following a second-place finish at the 2022 U.S. Nationals – they’ve won either gold or silver since 2018 – Hubbell/Donohue now head to the 2022 Winter Games for their last dance, and perhaps their best shot at an Olympic medal.

      "\u001b[92m\"When your itching feels out of control, put a cold compress right on your skin\" [1]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "There's no cure for eczema, but you can do plenty of things at home to give your skin some relief. Stay moisturized. Your skin needs moisture to heal and protect itself. Most lotions can't create a strong barrier for your skin because they contain water. Choose a thick cream or ointment instead. Petroleum jelly and mineral oil work well. Put it on your skin at least twice a day to keep your eczema at bay. Avoid drastic temperature changes. Going from a hot room into a chilly one may cause a flare-up. Try to keep your home at a comfortable, consistent temperature. Low humidity can dry your skin. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air. Skip long, hot showers. Very hot water will dry your skin and make your symptoms worse. Take lukewarm showers or baths instead. Use mild, perfume-free soap or non-soap cleanser, and avoid bubble baths. When you're done, gently towel off your skin -- don't rub -- until it's partly dry. Then, within 3 minutes, put on a moisturizer. If your doctor has prescribed an eczema cream, apply that to your skin first. Keep your house clean. Allergens like dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and mold put your immune system on alert, which can wake up your eczema. Skip scented laundry products. The perfume in many cleansers and fabric softeners can irritate your skin. You're better off using gentle, scent-free products. And always wash new clothes before wearing them. It'll help get rid of any excess dyes and chemicals that could inflame your skin. Wear loose clothing. It'll allow air next to your skin. Cotton or cotton-blend fabrics are good choices. That's especially helpful when you're working out because you're likely to sweat. Always avoid wool. It can rub against your skin and make you itch more. Try an over-the-counter oral antihistamine. Diphenhydramine ( Benadryl) works well to calm itching and help you sleep. Cetirizine ( Zyrtec) and loratadine ( Claritin) are non-drowsy options that may help you feel better during the day. Keep your cool. When your itching feels out of control, put a cold compress right on your skin. If your eczema is severe, after you've put on lotion or medicine, make a wet wrap by soaking a gauze or piece of soft clothing, like a T-shirt or pair of socks, in warm -- not hot -- water. Wet wraps help your skin absorb medicine and moisture. They also relieve itching and pain. Once they're dry, you'll want to either make them wet again or remove them. Ask your doctor if you should take vitamin D. Experts say there's a link between eczema and low levels of the âsunshineâ vitamin. Check to see what supplement you can try for a boost. Stay calm. Angst and stress can make you itch and scratch even more. Look for ways to ease your mind. Talk with friends, try a yoga class, or learn how to meditate. Asking a loved one to give you a quick massage with a moisturizing cream or oil may help, too.\n",

      "You're likely to have some fatigue while you're getting treated for breast cancer. That's one of the most common side effects of the disease and treatments for it. Fatigue isn't the same as being tired. Tiredness happens to everyone, and a good night's sleep usually re-energizes you. Fatigue is a daily lack of energy or whole-body tiredness that doesn't go away, even with good sleep. It can keep you from doing normal, daily things, and it affects your quality of life. Sometimes it's \"acute,\" meaning it lasts a month or less. In other cases it's \"chronic\" and lasts up to 6 months or longer. Usually, it comes on suddenly, and may continue after you're done with your treatment. Here are some possible reasons for it, along with tips to help you get some of your energy back. The disease itself can be the problem. Tumor cells steal calories and nutrients from normal cells, and that leads to tiredness that won't seem to let up. Treatments can cause fatigue, too: Chemotherapy . Any chemo drug can cause you to have fatigue. It lasts for a few days in some people, while others say they have it throughout treatment or even afterward. Radiation can give you fatigue that tends to get worse over time. It usually lasts 3 to 4 weeks after your treatment stops, but it can continue for up to 3 months. Hormone therapy deprives the body of estrogen, and that can lead to fatigue that may last throughout your treatment or longer. Bone marrow transplant . This aggressive form of treatment can give you a daily lack of energy that lasts up to 1 year. Targeted therapy. High amounts of these medications can lead to long-lasting fatigue. Combination therapy. Getting more than one cancer treatment at the same time or one after the other also increases your chances of feeling listless. Surgery. Everyone recovers from surgery at different rates. This can also cause some daily exhaustion. Cancer treatments can cause anemia, a blood disorder where your body's cells don't get the oxygen they need. And side effects of treatments -- such as nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, taste changes, heartburn, or diarrhea -- can lower the amount of nutrition you get, which can make you feel worn-out. Medicines used to treat side effects like nausea, pain, depression, anxiety, and seizures can cause fatigue, too. So can hormonal changes related to medications. If your thyroid gland is underactive, your metabolism may slow down so much that your body doesn't burn food fast enough to give you energy. This is a common condition, but it can also happen after radiation therapy to the lymph nodes in the neck. In older people, being less active and having problems moving around can lead to fatigue. Younger people in treatment sometimes overexert themselves and bring on daily lack of energy or whole-body tiredness. Chronic, severe pain makes it worse. Stress doesn't help, either. Fatigue often happens when people try to keep their normal daily routines and activities during treatment. Changing your activities can help you save energy. Depression and fatigue often go hand in hand, but it may not be clear which started first. One way to sort this out is to try to understand your depressed feelings and how they affect your life. Let your doctor know if you feel depressed all the time, were depressed before your cancer diagnosis, or are preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness. The first step is to try to figure out the source or sources of your fatigue. There may be more than one reason you're feeling this way. Your doctor can do tests to check for anemia or hypothyroidism. If you have one of these conditions, treatments can help. If you think your cancer treatment is the cause, you can talk to your doctor about ways to help you manage it, or discuss other options. Figure out your level of energy. Keep a diary for 1 week. Write down the times of day when you're most fatigued, and the times when you have the most energy. Note what you think might be the reasons why. Know the warning signs of fatigue: Tired eyes Tired legs Whole-body tiredness Stiff shoulders Trouble concentrating Weakness or malaise Boredom or lack of motivation Exhaustion, even after sleeping Irritability Nervousness, anxiety, or impatience 1. Plan ahead, and organize your work. Combine activities and simplify details. Ask family members or friends to help you with tasks when possible. 2. Pace yourself. A moderate pace is better than rushing through your day. 3. Balance periods of rest and work. Use your energy only on important tasks. Schedule rest before you become fatigued -- frequent, short breaks are helpful. 4. Alternate sitting and standing. When you sit, use a chair with good back support. Sit up with your back straight and your shoulders back. 5. Try to work without bending over. Adjust the level of your work instead. When you have to lift something, bend your knees and use your leg muscles to lift, not your back. 6. Limit work that requires reaching over your head or that adds to muscle tension. Change where you store items to reduce trips or reaching. Rather than moving a large load, break it into smaller ones, or use a cart. 7. Breathe evenly, and wear comfortable clothes to allow for free and easy breathing. 8. Avoid too-hot or too-cold temperatures. Don't take long, hot showers or baths. Cancer-related fatigue can get worse if you're not eating enough or if you're not eating the right foods. A balanced diet can help you feel better and have more energy. Here are some ways to improve your diet: Get enough calories. If you have cancer, you need about 15 calories per pound of weight if your weight has been stable. Add 500 calories per day if you've lost weight. For example, a person who weighs 150 pounds needs about 2,250 calories per day to maintain his or her weight. Get plenty of protein. It rebuilds and repairs damaged cells. Women need about 46 grams per day, and men need 56 grams. Good sources of protein include dairy foods, meat, eggs, and beans. Drink plenty of fluids. That will help you avoid fatigue that comes from dehydration. And it'll help you get calories. Drink things like water, juice, milk, broth, and milkshakes. Avoid drinks with caffeine. Also, you'll need more fluids if you have vomiting or diarrhea. Get enough vitamins. Ask your doctor whether you should take a vitamin supplement if you're not sure you're getting enough nutrients. A multivitamin provides many of the nutrients your body needs. But vitamin supplements don't have calories, so make sure you eat nutritious foods to get your calories. Consider seeing a registered dietitian. They can help you with any eating problems that may be keeping you from getting proper nutrition (such as problems swallowing, changes in tastes, or feeling full quickly). A dietitian can also suggest ways to get more calories and protein in smaller amounts of food. Your cancer and treatments may make you feel drained, leaving you lying in bed or sitting in chairs for hours. But that sort of inactivity can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, weakness, and further fatigue. Regular, moderate exercise can ease those feelings, help you stay active, and give you more energy. Even during your cancer treatment, you may be able to keep exercising. Here are some tips: Check with your doctor before you begin an exercise program. Start slowly if you get the OK. Give your body time to adjust. Keep a regular exercise schedule. Try to be active at least 150 minutes a week. If you're just starting, build up to this amount over time. The right kind of exercise never makes you feel sore, stiff, or exhausted. If you that happens or you feel out of breath, you're overdoing it. Swimming, brisk walking, stationary cycling, and low-impact aerobics (taught by a certified instructor) might be good choices. But talk to your doctor if you have any questions about exercises that are safe for you. Managing stress can play an important role in fighting fatigue. Here are some suggestions that may help. Adjust your expectations. For example, if you have a list of 10 things you want to accomplish today, pare it down to two and leave the rest for other days. A sense of accomplishment goes a long way toward easing stress. Help others understand and support you. Family and friends can be helpful if they can put themselves in your shoes and understand what fatigue means to you. Cancer support groups can be a source of strength, too. Other people with the disease may understand what you're going through. Relaxation techniques like deep breathing or visualization can lower stress, too. Or just do low-key things that are fun for you -- read, listen to music, or knit, for example. Let your doctor know if your stress seems out of control. He can help you feel better. Although cancer-related fatigue is a common side effect of cancer and its treatments, you should mention any of your concerns to your doctor. There are times when fatigue may be a clue to an underlying medical problem. Other times, there may be things your doctor can do to help control fatigue. Be sure to let your doctor or nurse know if you have: Shortness of breath Pain Side effects from treatments (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite) Anxiety or nervousness Depression\n",

      "It depends in part on your age and also on your eyes and family. If you're younger than 40 and have no eye problems, your doctor might suggest you get routine tests every 2 years. Or he could tell you that you don't need any tests. Ask what he thinks is best for you. If you're 40 or older, you should get your eyes checked every 1 to 2 years. If you've had eye trouble in the past, or if you're at risk for developing it (if someone in your family had it), you should see an eye doctor every year. Why? You need to check to see if you have serious, sometimes \"silent\" problems that can affect your vision, like: Glaucoma Age-related macular degeneration Cataracts Diabetic retinopathy If your child has no risk factors for eye problems, she should get her vision checked as a newborn and again at every regular health visit. By the time she's 3, it will be easier for the doctor to assess her eyes. After the first grade, she should get eye tests every 1 to 2 years. If you have a health condition like high blood pressure, work in a job that requires you to use your eyes a lot, or take drugs that can affect eyesight, you may need more frequent exams. If you have type 1 diabetes, get your eyes checked within 5 years of your diagnosis and every year after that. You'll need an exam ASAP if you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Have your eyes checked every year after that. When you call to make an appointment for your exam, mention any vision problem you're having. Before you go, list any questions you want to ask the doctor. Also be ready to update him or her on any medicines you take and your (and your family's) eye health history. Bring your glasses and contact lenses along with the prescription with you. Also bring sunglasses for the trip home. The doctor might use eye drops to open up your pupils. This is called dilation. Your eyes will be sensitive to light afterward. First, the eye doctor or an office staff member will ask you about your medical and vision history. The exam may last from half an hour to several hours, depending on the equipment used. It will cover your vision and your eye health. You'll probably have all or most of the following eye tests, and possibly some other ones, too: Eye muscle movement test: This checks your eyes' alignment. The doctor will watch your eyes move while you follow a target (like a finger tip or his pen) as it moves in different directions. Cover test: This tells how well your eyes work together. You'll stare at a small target some distance away. The doctor will cover and uncover each eye to observe how much your eyes move. Your doctor will also be watching for an eye that turns away from the target. This is a condition called strabismus. You may take the test again with a target close to you. External exam and pupil reactions: The doctor will watch how your pupils adjust to light and objects close to you. At the same time, the whites of your eyes and the position of your eyelids will also be checked. Visual acuity test: You'll sit in front of an eye chart, with letters that get smaller as you read down each line. You'll cover each eye in turn and, using the other eye, read aloud, going down the chart, until you can't read the letters anymore. Refraction testing: For your exact lens prescription, the doctor can use a computerized refractor. Your doctor may fine-tune the prescription by flipping the phoropter back and forth between lenses and asking you which is better. If you don't need corrective lenses, you won't have this test. Slit lamp (biomicroscope): This device magnifies and lights up the front of your eye. The doctor uses it to check your cornea, iris, lens, and the back of your eye, looking for signs of certain eye conditions. Retinal examination ( ophthalmoscopy ): Your doctor may dilate your pupils and use a tool called an ophthalmoscope and to see the back of your eyes -- the retina, retinal blood vessels, fluid in your eyes (he may call this vitreous fluid), and the head of your optic nerve. Glaucoma testing: This procedure checks to see if the fluid pressure inside your eyes is within a normal range. It's fast, painless, and can be done in a couple of ways: Tonometer: This is the most accurate. You'll get drops to numb your eyes. The doctor will tell you to stare straight ahead and will barely touch the front surface of each eye with a tool called an applanation tonometer or Tonopen to measure the pressure. Puff of air or noncontact tonometer: You'll stare at a target, and a machine will let out a small puff of air into each eye. How much your eye resists the puff indicates the pressure inside it. Pachymetry: This test uses ultrasound to measure the thickness of your cornea. Thin corneas can lead to false low-pressure readings. Thick corneas can lead to false high-pressure readings. You'll get this test just once to create a baseline for comparison with future readings. It can be used for people who need corneal surgery. Pupil dilation (enlargement): With your pupils fully enlarged, the doctor will use tools and lights to check the insides of your eyes. The eye drops for this part of the exam take about 20-30 minutes to work. They make your eyes more sensitive to light and blur your vision. These effects may last for several hours or longer. This is why you might need those sunglasses on your way home. Newer machine can look in the far back of your retina without your pupils being dilated. Visual field test (perimetry): Your visual field is the area you can see in front of you without moving your eyes. Using one of three tests, the eye doctor maps what you see at the edges (periphery) of your visual field and will use this map to diagnose eye conditions. Ask family or friends who they use. Ask your family doctor for a referral. Call the ophthalmology or optometry department of a nearby hospital and ask about doctors who practice there. Contact state and county academies, associations, or societies of optometrists and ophthalmologists, and ask if they can help you. Get a list from your health plan or health insurance company.\n",

Doctors use it to treat the following conditions: Cancers of the colon and rectum Some types of noncancerous growths in the colon and rectum Complicated diverticulitis The term \"laparoscopic\" refers to a type of surgery called laparoscopy, in which the surgeon works through very small (5-millimeter to 10-millimeter) \"keyhole\" cuts in the abdomen. A laparoscope is a small telescope-like instrument. Your surgeon will use it in order to see inside you during the operation. There are five main steps to this surgery. First, you'll get general anesthesia so that you're âasleep.â Then your surgeon will make a small cut (about half an inch) near your bellybutton and place the laparoscope through it so he can see images from inside you. Once the laparoscope is in place, the surgeon will make five or six more small (5-10 millimeter) cuts to make room for the surgical tools. Your surgeon will need to cut away the diseased section of your sigmoid colon and rectum. But first, he must free this section from what supports it. The bowel is attached to the abdominal wall by a layer of tissue called the mesentery, which also contains the main blood vessels (arteries) that take blood to the left side of the colon and rectum. Your surgeon will cut and close them. Then he'll free the sigmoid colon and part of the rectum from the mesentery, and cut away the diseased tissue. Later, he'll remove this part of the mesentery with the diseased bowel. The surgeon must rejoin the remaining end of the descending colon with the remaining end of the rectum. First, he will detach a part of the healthy descending colon from the mesentery so that he can stretch it toward the rectum. He'll also free the rectum from its mesentery so it can meet the end of the colon. To reduce the risk of cancer cells spreading, the surgeon will wash the rectum with a special solution. The cuts used in laparoscopy are very small, so the surgeon must remove the diseased section of bowel in a special way. He will enlarge one of the cuts and place a bag into your abdominal cavity, put the diseased bowel into the bag, and then pull the bag out of the enlarged cut. To do this, your surgeon will use a special stapling device he places into the rectum. Doctors call this rejoining of the colon and rectum an anastomosis. The stapling device \"fires\" a ring of staples to connect the two ends. The surgeon will check the anastomosis for leaks and rinse out your pelvis. Your surgeon may place a drain into your abdomen for a few days to help you recover after surgery. And he will stitch or tape close all the surgical cuts. You should avoid heavy lifting and abdominal exercises such as sit-ups for 6 weeks after the surgery. Apart from that, you should steadily build up your activity level when you get home. Walking is a great exercise choice. It will help your recovery by making you stronger, keeping your blood circulating to prevent blood clots, and helping your lungs remain clear. Did you work out before the surgery? You can get back to exercising when you feel comfortable and your doctor says it's OK. When you go home, you'll be able to eat almost everything except raw fruits and vegetables. You should continue this âsoftâ diet until your post-surgical check-up. If the diet makes you constipated, call your doctor's office for advice.\n",

      "The symptoms of ADHD include \u001b[92m\"People say you're forgetful\" [1]\u001b[0m, \u001b[92m\"People complain that you don't listen\" [2]\u001b[0m, \u001b[92m\"You're often late\" [3]\u001b[0m, \u001b[92m\"You have trouble concentrating\" [4]\u001b[0m, \u001b[92m\"You leave things undone\" [5]\u001b[0m, \u001b[92m\"You had behavior issues as a child\" [6]\u001b[0m, \u001b[92m\"You lack impulse control\" [7]\u001b[0m, \u001b[92m\"You can't get organized\" [8]\u001b[0m, \u001b[92m\"You're fidgety\" [9]\u001b[0m, and \u001b[92m\"You can't control your emotions\" [10]\u001b[0m. To diagnose ADHD, \u001b[92m\"doctors and psychologists get information about what and how many symptoms you have, when they started, how long they've lasted, and how severe they are\" [11]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"In order to be diagnosed with ADHD, you need to have several symptoms, not just one or two\" [12]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"And they have to have affected your jobs, relationships, or other important areas of your life\" [13]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"Your doctor will also want to rule out other conditions or find out if you have more than one disorder\" [14]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "Has anyone ever asked you if you have ADHD? Maybe you've even wondered yourself. The only way to know for sure is to see a doctor. That's because the disorder has a number of possible symptoms, and they can easily be confused with those of other conditions, like depression or anxiety. Not sure whether you should get checked by a doc? If many of these apply, you may need to get checked out. 1. People say you're forgetful. Everyone misplaces car keys or jackets once in a while. But this kind of thing happens often when you have ADHD. You might spend time looking for glasses, wallets, phones, and other items every day. You may also forget to return phone calls, space out on paying bills, or miss medical appointments. 2. People complain that you don't listen. Most of us lose focus on a conversation once in a while, especially if there's a TV nearby or something else grabs our attention. This happens often and to a greater degree with ADHD, even when there are no distractions around. But still, ADHD is more than that. 3. You're often late. Time management is an ongoing challenge when you have ADHD. It often leads to missed deadlines or appointments unless you work on avoiding that. 4. You have trouble concentrating. Problems with attention, especially focusing for long periods of time or paying attention to details, is one of the hallmarks of the condition. Depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders can also take a toll on your focus, and many people with ADHD have one or more of these issues, too. Your doctor can ask you questions to get to the bottom of what's causing your attention problems. 5. You leave things undone. Problems with attention and memory can make it tough to start or finish projects, especially ones that you know will take a lot of focus to complete. This symptom can point to depression, too. 6. You had behavior issues as a child. You need to have had attention and concentration problems as a child in order to be diagnosed with ADHD as an adult -- even if those early symptoms didn't come with a formal diagnosis. People may have accused you of being lazy back in childhood. Or they may have thought you had another condition like depression or anxiety. If you actually were diagnosed with the disorder as a child, you may still have it. The symptoms change as you age, and not everyone outgrows it. 7. You lack impulse control. This is more than tossing a candy bar into your cart at the checkout line. This is doing something even though you know it could have serious consequences, like running a red light because you think you can get away with it or not being able to keep quiet when you have something to say, even though you know you should. 8. You can't get organized. You may notice this more at work. You could have trouble setting priorities, following through on tasks, and meeting project deadlines. 9. You're fidgety. Kids with ADHD are often hyperactive, but adults are more likely to be fidgety or restless. You might also talk too much and interrupt others. 10. You can't control your emotions. You might be moody or irritable, express frustration often, feel unmotivated, or be prone to angry outbursts. ADHD can make it hard to manage uncomfortable emotions or follow appropriate behavior when you're upset. There's no one test. Instead, doctors and psychologists get information about what and how many symptoms you have, when they started, how long they've lasted, and how severe they are. In order to be diagnosed with ADHD, you need to have several symptoms, not just one or two. And they have to have affected your jobs, relationships, or other important areas of your life. Your doctor will also want to rule out other conditions or find out if you have more than one disorder. Several treatments can help you manage the condition. So if you answered yes to a lot of these questions, consider making an appointment with your doctor. The sooner you find out, the sooner you can start treatment.\n",

      "It may seem odd, but it's true. Psoriasis is related to some digestive disorders that are also autoimmune diseases. Right now, there isn't anything you can change about your lifestyle to specifically keep you from getting one of these digestive problems that's written into your genes. Research into the complex relationship is ongoing, and there's a lot more still to be learned. Here's what we know so far. There's a strong link between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. IBD includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis ( UC). Crohn's can affect any part of the stomach and intestines; UC usually affects the lower parts of your GI tract, the colon and rectum. After looking at the gene patterns of tens of thousands of people with serious autoimmune diseases, scientists are finding that the same problem genes can be responsible for psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. These conditions trigger inflammation in similar ways, too. Your skin and intestines are organs made up of tissue that absorbs things more easily, so it's not surprising that both are sensitive and react to the inflammation signals that travel throughout your body. One study found that 1 in 10 women with psoriasis develop an IBD. ( The odds were even higher for those with psoriatic arthritis, another condition linked with psoriasis.) People with psoriasis are 2.5 times more likely to get Crohn's and 1.6 times more likely to get UC. Some people get a digestive disorder first and psoriasis later. IBD and psoriasis also share a connection with obesity. Fat tissue seems to make chemicals that change how the body works, including the immune system. Having a lot of extra weight raises your odds of having psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. It can also make them get worse faster and make treatments less effective. When you have celiac disease, you can't digest gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease can damage your small intestine and prevent it from absorbing key nutrients. The chance of getting celiac disease is nearly 3 times higher among people with psoriasis. About 4 of every 100 have it. Research shows that the higher the levels of specific antibodies related to celiac disease, the worse psoriasis tends to be. Watch for signs of digestive issues, and tell your doctor so you can get tested and change your treatment plan, if needed. IBD ( Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) symptoms include: Diarrhea Belly cramps Blood in your poop Celiac disease or gluten sensitivity symptoms in adults may include: Diarrhea Bad-smelling poop Fatigue Feeling weak, dizzy, or short of breath Cold hands and feet Sore, achy joints You might mistake celiac disease for psoriatic arthritis, because both can cause joint pain and fatigue. Your doctor can order a blood test that measures levels of antibodies to check whether gluten affects you. It's often helpful to have a specialist called a gastroenterologist as well as a dermatologist on your health care team. You and your team can decide what treatment is right for you based on what and how severe your symptoms are and the medication side effects you're willing to deal with. The same drug may work for both your psoriasis and IBD. But some biologic medications are more likely than others to trigger a flare for someone who already has an IBD. Following a gluten-free diet has helped some people clear their psoriasis lesions as well as manage celiac. What's more, going gluten-free has helped people who test positive for a gluten sensitivity even when they don't have any celiac symptoms or signs of the disease. Healthy habits -- including a nutritious diet and regular exercise -- can help you feel better, lower your chance of having flares, and get a better result from treatment. Of course, take your medication as directed. Don't smoke, and limit how much alcohol you drink. Find ways to ease stress, maybe by joining a support group. Let your doctor know about any new or changing symptoms.\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[92m\"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is different for every person\" [1]\u001b[0m, making it \u001b[92m\"hard to predict exactly what it will be like\" [2]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"For most people, it's a cycle of flare-ups and periods when their skin is clear\" [3]\u001b[0m.

      "Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS) is different for every person, so it can be hard to predict exactly what it will be like. But along with your treatment plan, there are some good ways to manage the condition. It helps to know how the disease can affect your life, so you can make changes that will help. There's no cure for HS, so you'll have to manage the condition for life. For most people, it's a cycle of flare-ups and periods when their skin is clear. Breakouts tend to happen in the same general areas of your skin. But you may have a spot that stays broken-out all the time. Some women find their HS clears up after menopause. HS is called a progressive disease. That means it often gets worse over time. A small pimple can turn into a large boil within days or hours. If the boil ruptures underneath the skin, inflammation and infection spread quickly and new lumps form nearby. A flare-up may last a week or two. But treatment can keep HS from getting worse and help you avoid the most serious symptoms. The key is to start it early. Your symptoms and the way your body responds to treatment will determine how often you see your doctor. You may be able to manage mild symptoms on your own. If you take a drug that's injected or delivered through a vein, you may need to go in regularly. People with HS tend to have other conditions, too, such as severe acne, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Doctors don't know exactly why these conditions are linked. But it may be that whatever causes HS leads to other problems, too. It's rare, but people who have HS for a long time may be more likely to get a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. It's important to see your doctor regularly, keep her updated on how you feel, and talk about any new or unusual symptoms you've noticed. It depends on how severe your condition is. Large, deep nodules or lumps can hurt. And depending on where they are, you may not be able to sit or walk normally. Some people only get these painful lumps from time to time when the disease flares. But for others, the bumps or lumps never completely go away. Whether you have pain only during flares or more often, your doctor can help you control it. You may get numbing creams or over-the-counter or prescription pain medicine. The lumps themselves don't smell, but the fluid inside them does. When they burst and leak, the odor can escape, too. Wear loose clothing and try to keep things from rubbing against the cysts. Don't squeeze them. If they do burst, wash the area gently with an antiseptic cleanser to get rid of the smell. Antibiotics may also help. HS can be unpredictable. You may have a flare-up every few weeks, or you may go months with clear skin. Some women find they have breakouts before their periods. They may go away while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. There's no sure way to prevent breakouts. But they may not come back as often or be as bad if you follow your treatment plan, take any medication your doctor prescribes, and make some changes to your lifestyle. Get to a healthy weight. HS is closely tied to obesity. Losing weight is one of the best ways to keep it under control. Quit smoking. Stay cool. Your HS may get worse in the summer, when heat and sweat can trigger a flare-up. Swimming is a good way to get exercise without overheating. Don't shave near a breakout. If your razor irritates your skin, laser hair removal may be a better choice. Watch what you eat. There's some evidence that it may help to cut dairy and sugar from your diet. Ask your doctor if you should try it.\n",

      "How can MRI and MRCP help diagnose EPI?\n",
      "\n",
      "Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is when \u001b[92m\"your body doesn't feel right\" [1]\u001b[0m due to the inability to properly digest food because of \u001b[92m\"weight loss, greasy and foul-smelling stools that float or are tough to flush, stomach cramps, and diarrhea\" [2]\u001b[0m. An MRI, which \u001b[92m\"uses a magnet to take detailed pictures of your insides\" [3]\u001b[0m, and MRCP, \u001b[92m\"a special kind of MRI that focuses on your bile ducts and ducts in your pancreas\" [4]\u001b[0m, can help diagnose EPI by providing detailed images to identify any abnormalities in the pancreas and surrounding areas.\n",
      "When you have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI), you probably know your body doesn't feel right. Still, it's not always easy for doctors to diagnose your condition. The classic symptoms of EPI -- weight loss, greasy and foul-smelling stools that float or are tough to flush, stomach cramps, and diarrhea -- mimic the telltale signs of many other digestive diseases. You might even have one of those diseases along with EPI, like Crohn's or celiac disease. That makes it hard for doctors to know exactly which condition is causing you trouble. To add to the confusion, not everyone with EPI has the same classic symptoms. Other warning signs can be too subtle for you to notice. To figure out what's going on, your doctor will use tests to see how many nutrients your body is absorbing from food. Here's a rundown of the tests she might use. Blood work. Your doctor will take a sample of your blood and send it to a lab to check it for anemia, a condition in which your body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells. The lab will also test your blood for vitamin B12, iron, and folate. If the levels are too low, that can mean EPI is keeping your body from absorbing these nutrients. The lab might also look for a chemical your pancreas makes to help with digestion called trypsinogen. A level that's too high is a sign of a problem. Fecal elastase test. You'll give your doctor a solid stool sample. The lab will check it for an enzyme your pancreas makes to help your body digest protein, called elastase. If you have EPI, the amount might be less concentrated than normal. 3-day fecal test. You'll need to collect samples of your stool in special containers for about 3 days and give them to your doctor. The lab will test them for the amount of fat they have. CT scan. This machine looks like a giant doughnut. It takes special X-rays that show your tissues and blood vessels, along with your bones. You'll lie on a padded table that slides you up so the machine is over your upper tummy. The doctor may take one set of images and then ask you to drink a kind of dye (they'll call it contrast) to get a better picture of the area. Tell your doctor if you've had a bad reaction to the dye in the past or if you're allergic to shellfish, like shrimp, crab, lobster, oysters, scallops, clams, or mussels. A basic scan takes about 10-15 minutes, but if you need contrast, you'll be there longer. Endoscopic ultrasound. Your doctor might need to take a closer look at your pancreas and other organs to see if they're damaged or inflamed. In a hospital, doctors will put a thin tube in your mouth, down through your stomach, and into the first part of your small intestine. At the tip is an ultrasound probe that gives off sound waves. They help make a picture of the inside of your body, which doctors can see on a screen. You might be asleep or awake for the test, but you'll get medicine to make you more comfortable. The test usually takes 20 to 45 minutes, and you won't need to stay in the hospital overnight. During this test, your doctor can also take a small piece of your tissue to study under a microscope -- if he needs one. MRI and MRCP. The MRI machine uses a magnet to take detailed pictures of your insides. You'll lie on a padded table, and it will slide until your upper belly is under the magnet. You'll be awake for it, but if you get anxious in small, tight spaces, the doctor might give you a drug to help you relax. You won't have to stay overnight in the hospital. An MRCP is a special kind of MRI that focuses on your bile ducts and ducts in your pancreas. The MRI takes about 35 minutes. The MRCP takes about 10 minutes.\n",

However, a sore throat from a cold often gets better or goes away after the first day or two. Other cold symptoms such as a runny nose and congestion may follow the sore throat. Strep throat, which is an infection due to streptococcus bacteria, is another cause of sore throats and tonsillitis. With strep throat, the sore throat is often more severe and persists. Tonsillitis is a painful inflammation or infection of the tonsils, the tissue masses located at the back of the throat. Sore throats can be caused by viruses or bacteria. The most common causes of sore throats are viruses. Viral sore throats are often accompanied by other cold symptoms that may include a runny nose, cough, red or watery eyes, and sneezing. Other causes of sore throat include smoking, pollution or irritants in the air, allergies, and dry air. In addition to a sore throat, other common cold symptoms include: Runny nose Sneezing Cough Mild headache Mild body aches Fever Although there is no cure for a sore throat caused by a cold virus, there are ways to help you feel more comfortable. Drinking warm liquids, gargling with warm salt water, sucking on ice chips, or taking an over-the-counter medicine may relieve symptoms of pain or fever. When you are sick with a cold, it is also important to get enough rest, eat a healthy diet, and drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter cold medications may relieve cold and sore throat symptoms. However, the benefits of these drugs are minimal. Some cold medications include: Pain relievers, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen and naproxen, to relieve the aches and pains of a cold and sore throat. ( Aspirin should not be given to children because of its link to Reye's syndrome, a disorder that can cause brain damage and death.) Sore throat sprays and lozenges to soothe your throat and numb the throat pain temporarily. ( Lozenges should not be given to young children.) Decongestant nasal sprays to relieve a sore throat caused by postnasal drip -- nasal drainage that runs down your throat. ( Be sure to stop using nasal decongestant sprays after three days, or you may have an increase in congestion when you stop them.) Antibiotics should not be used to treat a cold virus and sore throat. Antibiotics are effective only against bacteria. They will not work on sore throats associated with colds, which are caused by viruses. Strep throat is caused by an infection of streptococcus bacteria. Strep throat spreads by having contact with an infected person's saliva or nasal secretions. Although strep throat is more common in children ages 5 to 15, it also occurs in adults. To diagnose strep throat, your doctor can check a rapid strep test or send a throat swab to the lab for a culture. In some cases, he or she may be able to diagnose strep based on your reported symptoms and other signs, such as white spots in the throat area, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Strep throat can cause more serious illnesses, such as rheumatic fever, a disease that may harm the heart valves. That's why it's important to get proper medical treatment. With proper treatment, strep throat is usually cured within 10 days. Strep throat symptoms are usually more severe than symptoms of a sore throat with a cold and may include the following: Sudden sore throat Loss of appetite Painful swallowing Red tonsils with white spots Fever The symptoms of a cold and strep throat can be very similar. If you think you have symptoms of strep throat, visit your health care provider. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and do a physical exam, and you may be given a strep test. A rapid strep test checks for streptococcus bacteria infection in the throat. The test is painless and takes very little time. The tip of a cotton swab is used to wipe the back of the throat. The swab is then tested right away. If the strep test is positive, you have strep throat. If the strep test is negative, you likely do not have strep throat. However, if there are strong signs of strep throat, your health care provider can do a different throat swab test that is sent to the lab to see if strep bacteria can be grown (cultured) from it. A throat culture takes a couple of days for results. Strep throat is treated using antibiotics, which kill the bacteria causing the infection. Antibiotics are often taken as pills or given as a shot. Penicillin and amoxicillin are common antibiotics used to treat strep throat. Other antibiotics are prescribed for people who are allergic to penicillin. Follow your health care provider's instructions for antibiotic use. Take all of the medication, even if you feel better. You should feel better within a day or two. A person with strep throat should stay home until 24 hours after starting the antibiotic. If your strep throat is not getting better, let your health care provider know right away. Do not stop taking your prescribedmedicine unless your health care provider tells you to. Call your health care provider if these symptoms occur: Fever one or two days after feeling better Nausea or vomiting Earache Headache Neck stiffness Skin rash Cough Swollen glands Painful joints Shortness of breath Dark urine, rash, or chest pain (may occur three to four weeks later) Sometimes, a sore throat is caused by tonsillitis, an inflammation of the tonsils. Tonsillitis can be caused by viruses or bacteria. While the tonsils' job is to help fight infection, the tonsils can also become infected. When they do, the result is tonsillitis and a very painful sore throat. In addition to a sore throat, a cold usually causes nasal symptoms, such as runny nose or congestion. With tonsillitis, your tonsils become swollen and may have telltale white or yellow spots. Other symptoms with tonsillitis include the following: Bad breath Fever Voice changes because of swelling Painful swallowing Swollen lymph glands in neck If the tonsillitis infection is bacterial like strep throat, then antibiotics are given. If the tonsillitis infection is viral, antibiotics will not help. The virus must run its course for the sore throat to resolve. For either type of throat infection, the following treatment measures may help: Getting plenty of rest Drinking lots of fluid Eating smooth, soothing foods like gelatin, ice cream, shakes, frozen desserts, and soup Avoiding crunchy or spicy foods Using a vaporizer Taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen, naproxen, or ibuprofen. Children should not take aspirin. If the tonsillitis infections occur repeatedly, or if the tonsils are interfering with sleep and breathing, the doctor may recommend a tonsillectomy, which is the surgical removal of the tonsils.\n",

      "When should you call your doctor or dentist about black hairy tongue?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[92m\"Call your doctor or dentist if the problem doesn't get better on its own\" [1]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "The name black hairy tongue may sound scary, but the condition is harmless. Black hairy tongue is caused by bacteria or fungi in the mouth, which make the tongue appear black and hairy. It's easily remedied by good old-fashioned oral hygiene. A black hairy tongue is caused by too much bacteria or yeast growth in the mouth. The bacteria build up on tiny rounded projections called papillae. These lie along the surface of the tongue. Instead of shedding as they normally do, the papillae start to grow and lengthen, creating hair-like projections. They can grow to 15 times their normal length. Normally, the papillae are pinkish-white. But as they grow, pigments from food, drinks, and possibly the bacteria or yeast themselves get caught in the papillae, dyeing the tongue a color. Most often that color is black, hence the name. But the tongue can also turn brown, yellow, green, or a variety of other colors. Certain lifestyle habits and conditions can make people more likely to develop black hairy tongue. They include: poor oral hygiene smoking tobacco drinking a lot of coffee or tea using antibiotics (which may disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the mouth) being dehydrated taking medications that contain the chemical bismuth (such as Pepto- Bismol for upset stomach) not producing enough saliva regularly using mouthwash that contains peroxide, witch hazel, or menthol getting radiation therapy to the head and neck Black hairy tongue is more common in men, people who use intravenous drugs, and those who are HIV-positive. Other than the appearance of the tongue, most people with black hairy tongue don't have any symptoms or feel any discomfort. The exception is when there is too much growth of the yeast Candida albicans, which can cause a burning sensation on the tongue. This burning sensation is called glossopyrosis. Some people complain of a tickling feeling in the back of the roof of the mouth, a metallic taste in their mouth, or nausea. In more severe cases, the condition may lead to a gagging feeling. Sometimes, food getting caught inside the extra-long papillae can cause bad breath. Practicing good oral hygiene is the best way to treat black hairy tongue. Gently brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Also, brush your tongue. You can use a tongue scraper to make sure you're thoroughly cleaning the area. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help keep your mouth clean. Other tips include: If you smoke, quit. Add more roughage to your diet. Soft foods won't clean off the tongue effectively. Call your doctor or dentist if the problem doesn't get better on its own. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or an antifungal drug to get rid of the bacteria or yeast. Topical medications, such as tretinoin ( Retin- A), are also sometimes prescribed. As a last resort, if the problem doesn't improve, the papillae can be surgically clipped off with a laser or electrosurgery.\n",

      "The secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5 in the human stomach lumen, a level maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase. The parietal cell releases bicarbonate into the bloodstream in the process, which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood, known as an alkaline tide. The acidic gastric juice also contains digestive enzymes produced by other cells in the gastric glands – gastric chief cells. Gastric chief cells secrete an inactivated pepsinogen. Once in the stomach lumen gastric acid activates the proenzyme to pepsin. Gastric acid further inhibits the survival and progress of many pathogens in the stomach Secretion A typical adult human stomach will secrete about 1.5 liters of gastric juice daily. Gastric juice is the combination of gastric gland secretions including the main component of hydrochloric acid (gastric acid), gastric lipase and pepsinogen. Once in the stomach pepsinogen is changed by gastric acid to the digestive enzyme pepsin adding this enzyme to the gastric juice. Gastric acid secretion is produced in several steps. Chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted separately from the cytoplasm of parietal cells and mixed in the canaliculi. This creates a negative potential of between −40 and −70 mV across the parietal cell membrane that causes potassium ions and a small number of sodium ions to diffuse from the cytoplasm into the parietal cell canaliculi. Gastric acid is then secreted along with other gland secretions into the gastric pit for release into the stomach lumen. \n",
      "Acid in the stomach serves several purposes but is mostly associated with degrading proteins and polysaccharides so they can cross the intestinal epithelium. Approximately 2 L of HCl is produced daily. The pH level in the stomach ranges from 1.5 to 3, depending on factors such as food intake, stress, and medications or supplements.1 An increase in HCl and decreasing pH level also signal gastric motility to turn on to move the partially digested bolus of food along and help kill bacteria normally ingested with food. The pH of the stomach is regulated by a negative feedback loop by antral D cells that release somatostatin which inhibits the release of gastrin.2 As food moves out of the stomach, the H+ concentration increases which also serves to inhibit HCl secretion.1 \n",

      "\n",
      "The idea of 'Pi Day' originated with physicist Larry Shaw, who organized the first Pi, Day celebration at the San Francisco Exploratorium in 1988.\n",
      "In 1988, the earliest known official or large-scale celebration of Pi Day was organized by Larry Shaw at the San Francisco Exploratorium, where Shaw worked as a physicist, with staff and public marching around one of its circular spaces, then consuming fruit pies. The Exploratorium continues to hold Pi Day celebrations. On March 12, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution (111 H. Res. 224), recognizing March 14, 2009, as National Pi Day. For Pi Day 2010, Google presented a Google Doodle celebrating the holiday, with the word Google laid over images of circles and pi symbols; and for the 30th anniversary in 2018, it was a Dominique Ansel pie with the circumference divided by its diameter. In Indonesia, as a country that uses the DD/MM/YYYY date format, some people celebrate Pi Day every July 22, referring to another Pi number, namely 22/7. Some observed the entire month of March 2014 (3/14) as 'Pi Month'. In the year 2015, March 14 was celebrated as 'Super Pi Day'. It had special significance, as the date is written as 3/14/15 in month/day/year format. At 9:26:53, the date and time together represented the first ten digits of π, and later that second, 'Pi Instant' represented all of π's digits. Observance Pi Day related offering at Delicious Orchards, a country food market in Colts Neck, New Jersey Pi Day has been observed in many ways, including eating pie, throwing pies and discussing the significance of the number π, due to a pun based on the words 'pi' and 'pie' being homophones in English ( /paɪ/), and the coincidental circular shape of many pies. Many pizza and pie restaurants offer discounts, deals, and free products on Pi Day. Also, some schools hold competitions as to which student can recall pi to the highest number of decimal places. \n",
      "The idea of 'Pi Day' originated with physicist Larry Shaw, who organized the first Pi Day celebration at the San Francisco Exploratorium in 1988. Almost exactly twenty-one years later, on March 11, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution proclaiming March 14 to be National Pi Day. The resolution encourages schools to teach their students about pi and to 'engage them about mathematics.' On behalf of the thousands and thousands of people who have enjoyed Pi Day and were, as a result, engaged about mathematics, thank you Mr. Shaw! On this page, the following (common but not universal) convention is used: when counting digits of pi, the initial '3' is skipped. For example, pi to eight digits is 3.14159265. Pi Facts The largest number of decimal digits of pi ever computed is one hundred trillion (100,000,000,000,000). This staggering achievement was completed on March 21, 2022 by Emma Haruka Iwao using Google Cloud. The total time of the computation was 158 days. \n",

The decision is currently made roughly seven years in advance of the tournament, though the hosts for the 2022 tournament were chosen at the same time as those for the 2018 tournament. Only Mexico, Italy, France, Germany (West Germany until shortly after the 1990 World Cup) and Brazil have hosted the event on two occasions.

The cerebellum is situated posterior to the pons and forms part of the roof (tectum) of the forth ventricle. The pons contains nuclei that receive axons from various cortical areas. Projections from the axons of these pontine neurons form large transverse fiber bundles that traverse the pons and ascend to the contralateral cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncles.

      "The hypothesis posited by researchers[who?] is that Hume's behavior towards Clara - excluding and excommunicating her in retaliation for her ongoing ill-treatment of him - became known as 'the cold turkey treatment', and that word quickly spread from London to the rest of Britain, and finally the United States. An early print appearance of 'cold turkey' in its exclusionary sense dates to 1910, in Canadian poet Robert W.

I'd lost five thousand dollars. I knew they'd handed me out 'cold turkey'...'

The phrase 'taking cold turkey' has also been reported during the 1920s as slang for pleading guilty. Goosebumps \n",
      "The problem with both of these theories is that they ignore the uses of cold turkey before its application to drug addiction. In a cartoon that appeared in newspapers on November 12, 1920, ace slangman Thomas 'TAD' Dorgan used cold turkey this way – 'Now tell me on the square – can I get by with this for the wedding – don't string me – tell me cold turkey.' The editors of the Historical Dictionary of American Slang have found an earlier use: a 1910 usage where the speaker lost $5,000 cold turkey, in the sense of losing it outright. It may be that the original cold turkey was a combination of cold ('straightforward, matter-of-fact') and the earlier talk turkey, which dates back to the early 1800s and refers to speaking plainly. Regardless of its ultimate origins, the phrase manages to vividly capture the initial dread and discomfort that comes from immediately quitting something that's addictive, from drugs to dating apps.

The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Games experienced the biggest loss recorded at approximately $2 billion (USD). Costs The current highest cost of hosting the Olympic Games was the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Games, costing approximately US$11.1 billion. In order to meet the requirements set out by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) The Rio de Janeiro council had to invest heavily in building the necessary facilities/venues, and an entirely new subway line. The lack of a solid infrastructure to support these investments led to the council underestimating their costs by 25%. The costs of hosting the Olympic Games can be classified into 2 categories; infrastructure and operational costs. Infrastructure This section does not cite any sources.

(June 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) General infrastructure The costs of general infrastructure consist of preparing the necessary infrastructure to accommodate the influx of tourists and athletes in the host city. The International Olympic Committee requires a minimum of 40,000 hotel rooms available for visiting spectators and an Olympic Village that is able to house 15,000 athletes, referees, and officials. Internal and external transportation facilities that can transport spectators into and out of the host city and from venue to venue are also required by the Committee. These requirements are often met through renovations to already-built facilities or construction of entirely new facilities. These facilities include train/subway lines, roads, and airports.

She also starred with Donald Sinden in the ITV sitcom Two's Company (1975–79), which earned her a 1979 BAFTA TV Award nomination.

      "Tonight’s 30 Rock contained a few things we all probably expected: the fallout from Ms. Elizabeth Lemon getting married without inviting alleged best friend and self-proclaimed moon of the universe Jenna; some transitional stuff to move us into the rest of the season; and a good bit of letdown owing to the fact that it’s not the Liz-Criss wedding episode anymore.   It also had some lovely surprises, including two super-solid Lost references; plenty of guest stars crowding onto the final-season lifeboat (Will Ferrell as Bitch Hunter!); and the revelation of what Jenna looks like under grocery-store-milk-aisle lighting. The latter was a truly Gollum-esque sight, far worse than Liz in HD, and proof of something I’ve believed since high school: She who controls the light board controls the world.   But the one thing about tonight that none of us (who don’t read spoilers) saw coming was the sad passing of Jack’s harpy mom, Colleen, played for seven seasons by the great Elaine Stritch in perhaps the most lovingly drawn New York City in-joke this show ever generated — and yes, I’m counting tonight’s Chuck Scarborough/Sue Simmons bonanza. Colleen was the kind of woman who could provoke a Buddhist monk into whipping a battery at her, who would conceive a child simply because Dragnet got preempted, and who always insisted upon traveling on Pearl Harbor Day to, and I quote, 'show the Emperor we’re not afraid.' \n",

      "The emerald ash borer (EAB), an invasive wood-boring beetle from Asia, is responsible for the death and decline of tens of millions of ash trees in North America. EAB lays its eggs in the bark crevices of ash trees. The eggs hatch and the larvae burrow into the tree where they feed. This feeding is what damages the trees. We have detected EAB infestations in 36 States and the District of Columbia. EAB is difficult to detect early when pest populations are small because damage to the trees is hidden under the bark and tree decline is gradual. The beetle is well-suited to our climate, is a good flyer, and spreads naturally. People contribute to the long-distance spread of the beetle when they move EAB-infested ash firewood, logs or nursery stock. EAB was first detected in North America in 2002 in southeast Michigan.

      "into the right ventricle (2). From the right ventricle, blood is pushed out through the pulmonary valve (B) and into the pulmonary trunk (5). This artery branches into two arteries, the left pulmonary artery (5L) and the right pulmonary artery (5R) which will deliver the blood to the lungs where it will become oxygenated. Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs through the left and right pulmonary veins (9) which empties into the left atrium (3). From the left atrium, blood goes through the bicuspid valve, which is also called the mitral valve (D) and enters the most muscular part of the heart, the left ventricle (4). A powerful contraction of the left ventricle will send blood through the aortic valve (C) and into the largest artery of the body, the aorta (6). \n",
      "Arteries and veins transport blood in two distinct circuits: the systemic circuit and the pulmonary circuit. Systemic arteries provide blood rich in oxygen to the body’s tissues. The blood returned to the heart through systemic veins has less oxygen, since much of the oxygen carried by the arteries has been delivered to the cells. In contrast, in the pulmonary circuit, arteries carry blood low in oxygen exclusively to the lungs for gas exchange. Pulmonary veins then return freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart to be pumped back out into systemic circulation. Although arteries and veins differ structurally and functionally, they share certain features. \n",
      "Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to the heart. Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller vessels, forming arterioles. Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body tissues. Capillaries lead back to small vessels known as venules that flow into the larger veins and eventually back to the heart. \n",
      "The systemic circulation provides the functional blood supply to all body tissue. It carries oxygen and nutrients to the cells and picks up carbon dioxide and waste products. Systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle, through the arteries, to the capillaries in the tissues of the body. From the tissue capillaries, the deoxygenated blood returns through a system of veins to the right atrium of the heart. \n",
      "Blood flow through the heart involves contractions of the heart muscle to move blood from the right chambers of the heart to the lungs—where it receives oxygen—and then to the left chambers of the heart where it is pumped to the rest of the body through a network of blood vessels. Involved in this process are four heart valves that are synchronized to open and shut with each heartbeat. This ensures the consistent flow of blood in one direction from the heart via arteries (which carry oxygenated blood) and back to the heart via veins (which carry deoxygenated blood along with carbon dioxide). This article maps the order of blood flow through the heart. It also describes problems that can affect blood flow when different parts of the circulatory system malfunction. How the Circulatory System artpartner-images / Getty Images Components of the Heart Involved in Blood Flow The heart has two upper chambers, called the left and right atriums, and two lower chambers, called the left and right ventricles. With each heartbeat, blood moves from one chamber to the next through a series of heart valves. The heart rate and rhythm are controlled by the cardiac conduction system which delivers electric impulses that contract and relax the heart muscle. Several major arteries and veins are involved in this process: The pulmonary artery transfers blood from the heart to the lungs. The pulmonary vein transfers blood from the lungs to the heart. The aorta delivers oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The superior vena cava and inferior vena cava transport deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart. There are four valves that control blood flow in and out of the chambers of the heart: \n",
      "Oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary vein into the left atrium.The blood then moves through the mitral valve into the left ventricle.The left ventricle then pumps the blood through the aortic valve into the aorta.From the aorta, the blood is transported through the network of blood vessels, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues and taking carbon dioxide and wastes from tissues.Deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via the superior and inferior vena cava, and the cycle begins again. Order of Blood Flow Through the Body: Step by Step Once oxygenated blood leaves the heart, it is pumped through a network of vessels throughout the body to deliver nutrients and oxygen to cells. Here is the path blood flows once it exits the left side of the heart: Oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart gets pumped out of the aorta, the largest vessel of the body. The aorta extends from the left ventricle of the heart down into the abdomen.Blood then flows through arteries that branch off from the aorta. These arteries deliver blood to different areas of the body.Arteries then split into smaller vessels known as arterioles, which then carry blood to the smallest vessels in the body—the capillaries.The capillaries deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues of your body and simultaneously remove carbon dioxide to be eliminated in the lungs.Deoxygenated blood from the capillaries then flows back to the heart through small vessels known as venules.The venules then gradually merge to form veins.Blood enters back into the heart via large veins known as the superior and inferior vena cava.Blood is then pumped through the right side of the heart, into the lungs to get oxygen, and back into the left side of the heart. \n",
      "Pulmonary circulation moves blood between the heart and the lungs. It transports deoxygenated blood to the lungs to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood then flows back to the heart. Systemic circulation moves blood between the heart and the rest of the body. It sends oxygenated blood out to cells and returns deoxygenated blood to the heart. 2. The Heart Powers Both Types of Circulation The heart pumps oxygenated blood out of the left ventricle and into the aorta to begin systemic circulation. After the blood has supplied cells throughout the body with oxygen and nutrients, it returns deoxygenated blood to the right atrium of the heart. The deoxygenated blood shoots down from the right atrium to the right ventricle. The heart then pumps it out of the right ventricle and into the pulmonary arteries to begin pulmonary circulation. The blood moves to the lungs, exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen, and returns to the left atrium. The oxygenated blood shoots from the left atrium to the left ventricle below, to begin systemic circulation again. 3. The Circulatory System Works in Tandem with the Respiratory System \n",

      "The divestment movement really took off in the United Kingdom in the 1960s when the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) called for an international conference on sanctions against South Africa. By calling for the complete divestment of funds from the nation the AAM sparked a turning point for the global call to end apartheid. Many organizations both in the U.K..and U.S. called for divestment at the federal, state, and local level as well as in private corporations and the education system. The divestment of funds from any of these sectors would mean a decrease in the value of the South African Rand and the complete destruction of the South African economy, forcing the apartheid regime to rethink their unequal legislation. \n",
      "The Anti-Apartheid Movement at universities across the United States is where one is able to find some of the most vocal advocates for change. As early as 1977, major universities such as Ohio University, the University of Massachusetts, and Hampshire College had begun to divest funds from apartheid South Africa (ACOA, January 1982). By August 1988 155 universities across the United States had divested from South Africa, a huge spike since 1984, when only 53 universities had joined the cause. This spike in divestment correlates to the passing of the 1986 Anti-Apartheid Act by the US government and the further increase in public awareness to the atrocities occurring in South Africa. \n",
      "In a total rejection of apartheid, black South Africans mobilized to make the townships ungovernable, black local officials resigned in droves, and the government declared a State of Emergency in 1985 and used thousands of troops to quell 'unrest'. Television audiences throughout the world were to watch almost nightly reports of massive resistance to apartheid, the growth of a democratic movement, and the savage police and military response. The result of the widely televised South African response was 'a dramatic expansion of international actions to isolate apartheid, actions that combined with the internal situation to force dramatic changes in South Africa's international economic relations'. Higher education endowments Student anti-apartheid activists in the US demanded that their colleges and universities divest from companies that traded or had operations in South Africa, and put pressure on boards of trustees. \n",
      "A comprehensive list of the students' demands was published on 28 February 1986. The 'Women at College Hall' agreed to end the blockade if the Board of Trustees agreed to 'issue a statement of intent to deliberate again, with a quorum, the issue of divestment' before Spring Break, and to consider 'a restructuring of the investment policy'. Students also demanded that a teach-in be conducted to educate the college and the Board of Trustees on divestment and South African apartheid. On 1 March 1986, the protest ended when administrators agreed that the trustees would re-evaluate their decision, a mandatory teach-in would be held, and amnesty would be granted to anyone involved in the sit-in and blockade. As a result of student pressure, by 31 October 1988 Smith College had divested all $39 million in stocks that they held in companies working in South Africa. Harvard University \n",
      "The capital flight triggered a dramatic decline in the international exchange rate of the South African rand. The currency decline made imports more expensive, and this in turn caused inflation in South Africa to rise at a steep 12–15% per year. The South African government attempted to restrict the damaging outflow of capital. Knight writes that 'in September 1985 it imposed a system of exchange control and a debt repayments standstill. Under exchange control, South African residents are generally prohibited from removing capital from the country and foreign investors can only remove investments via the financial rand, which is traded at a 20% to 40% discount compared to the commercial rand. This means companies that disinvest get significantly fewer dollars for the capital they withdraw.' Criticism of disinvestment Within South Africa there was opposition to disinvestment among both black and white political leaders. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Chief Minister of KwaZulu and president of the Inkatha Freedom Party, slammed sanctions, stating that 'They can only harm all the people of Southern Africa. They can only lead to more hardships, particularly for the blacks.' The Members of Parliament Helen Suzman and Harry Schwarz, who opposed apartheid and were leaders of the Progressive Federal Party, also argued that disinvestment would cause further economic hardships for black people and that this would ultimately worsen the political climate for negotiations. Suzman said that such sanctions are 'self-defeating, wrecking the economy and do not assist anybody irrespective of race'. Schwarz said, 'Morality is cheap when someone else is paying.' \n",
      "On May 9, 1994, Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid activist, released from prison only four years prior, was democratically elected the president of South Africa. Mandela's historic presidency would never have been possible during the time of apartheid—the end of which was, in part, achieved through protest divestment. Protest divestment is a form of dissent in which stockholders intentionally sell their assets from a corporation to enact social change. By selling off stocks, protesters hope to influence corporations against performing some aspect of their business. In this case, those opposed to apartheid wanted to keep companies from doing business in South Africa. In this article, we will explore protest divestment in South Africa to show how the simple act of selling a stock can affect real social change. Understanding Divestment Anti-apartheid protests took hold in the 1960s, particularly on the campuses of American colleges and universities. Initially, protesters wanted to end apartheid, but there were not many ways to influence the South African government using the traditional forms of protest such as picketing or demonstrations. Eventually, members of the college-based anti-apartheid movement thought of a more practical way to enact change by pressuring their universities to divest stocks of companies doing business in the country. Many students brought attention to their cause by building shanties on their own campuses to represent the living conditions many oppressed South Africans faced daily. Schools use a certain percentage of their endowment funds as an investment tool, and many schools have quite a large endowment fund. By 2021, more than 107 US schools had endowments of more than $1 billion, giving them an incredible amount of purchasing power. \n",
      "While there were strong arguments against divestment, many students continued their protests. Eventually, college administrators saw it the students' way. The first school to agree to divest its portfolio of companies doing business in South Africa was Hampshire College. By 1988, a total of 155 colleges had at least partially divested. While the roots of the divestment movement took hold in America's college campuses, other large entities also soon sold their stocks. By the end of the decade, 90 cities, 22 counties, and 26 states had taken some form of economic stance against the South African government. As a result, many public pension funds were required to sell South African-related assets. Divestment movements were gaining ground in other countries as well. The college-based divestment efforts may or may not have played a role in immediately affecting the South African economy, but they did raise awareness about the problem of apartheid. After the divestment movement gained worldwide notoriety, U.S. Congress was moved to pass a series of economic sanctions against the South African government. From 1985 to 1990, over 200 U.S. companies cut all ties with South Africa, resulting in a loss of $1 billion in direct American investment. South Africa was ravaged by capital flight as businesses, investors, and money left the country. The rand, South Africa's currency, was significantly devalued and inflation reached double digits. The economic situation, as well as the resistance efforts of those suffering under apartheid, meant South Africa's system had to come to an end. \n",

      "Debate about treaty making in the Constitutional Convention In response to various concerns about the ineffectualness of the Articles, a Constitutional Convention was held in 1787 to debate and draft a more robust governing document. During the Convention, it was initially contemplated that the U.S. Senate, the newly proposed upper house of Congress, would have the power to make treaties (as well as to appoint ambassadors and judges of the Supreme Court). Just ten days before the Convention adjourned, it was decided that these powers would be shared with the President. Many delegates cited the established international tradition of executives holding exclusive power over foreign relations and agreements; the participation of the Senate through the 'advice and consent' mechanism was added as something of a compromise. \n",
      "Treaties are comparatively rare in modern U.S. foreign policy. Between 1946 and 1999, the federal government completed nearly 16,000 international agreements, of which only 6% (912) were treaties submitted to the Senate for approval under Article II of the Constitution; most were congressional-executive agreements. Role of Congress Although Article II of the Constitution pertains to the executive branch, the Treaty Clause provides that the power to make treaties is shared between the President and the Senate. However, the clause has never been interpreted as giving the Senate the power or duty to advise the President before a treaty is concluded; in practice, the Senate's authority is limited to either disapproving or approving a treaty, with the latter including the power to attach conditions or reservations. Repeal of treaties \n",
      "As early as the George Washington administration—the first under the Constitution and therefore the Treaty Clause—presidents have generally not sought the Senate's participation in all stages of treaty-making. Washington had initially consulted the Senate on proposed treaties, but ultimately abandoned the practice after finding it unproductive. The subsequent and widely accepted practice is that the President independently negotiates and signs treaties and then presents the proposed treaty to the Senate for its approval or disapproval. Like Washington, many Presidents have approached the Article II treaty process in different ways. Theodore Roosevelt, whose administration had a robust foreign policy, argued that ratification was necessary where an international accord would bind subsequent governments: \n",
      "Agreements beyond these competencies must have the approval of Congress (for congressional-executive agreements) or the Senate (for treaties). In 1972, Congress passed legislation requiring the president to notify Congress of any executive agreements that are formed. Although the nondelegation doctrine prevents Congress from delegating its legislative authority to the executive branch, Congress has allowed the executive to act as its 'agent' in trade negotiations, such as by setting tariffs, and, in the case of Trade Promotion Authority, by solely authoring the implementing legislation for trade agreements.

      "'Adoption' is the formal act by which the form and content of a proposed treaty text are established. As a general rule, the adoption of the text of a treaty takes place through the expression of the consent of the states participating in the treaty-making process. Treaties that are negotiated within an international organization will usually be adopted by a resolution of a representative organ of the organization whose membership more or less corresponds to the potential participation in the treaty in question. A treaty can also be adopted by an international conference which has specifically been convened for setting up the treaty, by a vote of two thirds of the states present and voting, unless, by the same majority, they have decided to apply a different rule. [Art.9, Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties 1969] Amendment \n",
      "After a treaty has been concluded, the written instruments, which provide formal evidence of consent to be bound, and also reservations and declarations, are placed in the custody of a depositary. Unless the treaty provides otherwise, the deposit of the instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession establishes the consent of a state to be bound by the treaty. For treaties with a small number of parties, the depositary will usually be the government of the state on whose territory the treaty was signed. Sometimes various states are chosen as depositaries. Multilateral treaties usually designate an international organization or the Secretary-General of the United Nations as depositaries. The depositary must accept all notifications and documents related to the treaty, examine whether all formal requirements are met, deposit them, register the treaty and notify all relevant acts to the parties concerned.

In the case of bilateral treaties, ratification is usually accomplished by exchanging the requisite instruments, while in the case of multilateral treaties the usual procedure is for the depositary to collect the ratifications of all states, keeping all parties informed of the situation. The institution of ratification grants states the necessary time-frame to seek the required approval for the treaty on the domestic level and to enact the necessary legislation to give domestic effect to that treaty.

      "The United States Constitution provides that the president 'shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur' (Article II, section 2). Treaties are binding agreements between nations and become part of international law. Treaties to which the United States is a party also have the force of federal legislation, forming part of what the Constitution calls ''the supreme Law of the Land.'' The Senate does not ratify treaties. Following consideration by the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Senate either approves or rejects a resolution of ratification. If the resolution passes, then ratification takes place when the instruments of ratification are formally exchanged between the United States and the foreign power(s). The Senate has considered and approved for ratification all but a small number of treaties negotiated by the president and his representatives. In some cases, when Senate leadership believed a treaty lacked sufficient support for approval, the Senate simply did not vote on the treaty and it was eventually withdrawn by the president. Since pending treaties are not required to be resubmitted at the beginning of each new Congress, they may remain under consideration by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for an extended period of time. In recent decades, presidents have frequently entered the United States into international agreements without the advice and consent of the Senate. These are called 'executive agreements.' Though not brought before the Senate for approval, executive agreements are still binding on the parties under international law.

      "Rodinia (from the Russian родина, rodina, meaning 'motherland, birthplace') was a Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic supercontinent that assembled 1.26–0.90 billion years ago (Ga) and broke up 750–633 million years ago (Ma). Valentine & Moores 1970 were probably the first to recognise a Precambrian supercontinent, which they named 'Pangaea I.' It was renamed 'Rodinia' by McMenamin & McMenamin 1990 who also were the first to produce a reconstruction and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent. Rodinia formed at c. 1.23 Ga by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent, Columbia, assembled by global-scale 2.0–1.8 Ga collisional events. Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic with its continental fragments reassembled to form Pannotia 633–573 Ma. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known about the configuration and geodynamic history of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the Earth's crust but not to their longitude, which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed. The extreme cooling of the global climate around 717–635 Ma (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes. Geodynamics Paleogeographic reconstructions Rodinia at 900 Ma. 'Consensus' reconstruction of Li et al. 2008. The idea that a supercontinent existed in the early Neoproterozoic arose in the 1970s, when geologists determined that orogens of this age exist on virtually all cratons.[failed verification] Examples are the Grenville orogeny in North America and the Dalslandian orogeny in Europe. Since then, many alternative reconstructions have been proposed for the configuration of the cratons in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different cratons. Though the configuration of the core cratons in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data. Life timelineThis box: Most reconstructions show Rodinia's core formed by the North American Craton (the later paleocontinent of Laurentia), surrounded in the southeast with the East European Craton (the later paleocontinent of Baltica), the Amazonian Craton and the West African Craton; in the south with the Río de la Plata and São Francisco cratons; in the southwest with the Congo and Kalahari cratons; and in the northeast with Australia, India and eastern Antarctica. The positions of Siberia and North and South China north of the North American craton differ strongly depending on the reconstruction: SWEAT-Configuration (Southwest US-East Antarctica craton): Antarctica is southwest of Laurentia, and Australia is north of Antarctica. AUSWUS-Configuration (Australia-western US): Australia is west of Laurentia. AUSMEX-Configuration (Australia-Mexico): Australia is at the location of current day Mexico relative to Laurentia. \n",
      "According to J.D.A. Piper, Rodinia is one of two models for the configuration and history of the continental crust in the latter part of Precambrian times. The other is Paleopangea, Piper's own concept. Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the late Proterozoic and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent 'Paleopangaea' supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 Ma and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 Ma. This latter solution predicts that break-up was confined to the Ediacaran period and produced the dramatic environmental changes that characterised the transition between the Precambrian and Phanerozoic. However, this theory has been widely criticized, as incorrect applications of paleomagnetic data have been pointed out. Breakup In 2009 UNESCO's International Geoscience Programme project 440, named 'Rodinia Assembly and Breakup,' concluded that Rodinia broke up in four stages between 825 and 550 Ma: The breakup was initiated by a superplume around 825–800 Ma whose influence—such as crustal arching, intense bimodal magmatism, and accumulation of thick rift-type sedimentary successions—has been recorded in South Australia, South China, Tarim, Kalahari, India, and the Arabian-Nubian Craton. Rifting progressed in the same cratons 800–750 Ma and spread into Laurentia and perhaps Siberia. India (including Madagascar) and the Congo–São Francisco Craton were either detached from Rodinia during this period or simply never were part of the supercontinent. As the central part of Rodinia reached the Equator around 750–700 Ma, a new pulse of magmatism and rifting continued the disassembly in western Kalahari, West Australia, South China, Tarim, and most margins of Laurentia. \n",
      "Rodinia, a Russian term for 'motherland,' was the next older supercontinent; it came together about 1 billion years ago and rifted apart about 750 million years ago. Its existence is well agreed upon, but its configuration has been controversial for more than two decades. The scientists noticed that the Tasmanian Rocky Cape Group and Grand Canyon's Unkar Group have uncanny bed-by-bed similarity. Credit: University of New Mexico 'We started this work by looking at Mesoproterozoic (~1 billion years old) sedimentary rocks in Tasmania, a small island off southeast Australia,' said Mulder. 'These rocks had puzzled us for a long time because they didn't look a lot like the nearby Mesoproterozoic rocks in Australia. We wanted to know where the ancient sedimentary rocks in Tasmania were sourced from so we analysed sand-sized grains of the mineral zircon, which makes up a small proportion of the sedimentary rocks.' \n",
      "Pangaea was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, approximately 336 million years ago. Pangaea is from the Greek words pan, meaning 'entire,' and 'gaia,' meaning 'earth.' Alfred Wegener proposed the existence of Pangaea in the early 20th century based on evidence from geology, paleontology, and continental drift. Supercontinents like Gondwana and Laurasia combined with the Siberia landmass, resulting in Pangaea. A single large ocean called Panthalassa surrounded Pangaea. The formation of Pangaea had significant impacts on Earth's climate and biota: It created vast deserts in the center of the continent due to its distance from the ocean, while coastal areas experienced humid climates. The breakup of Pangaea began around 200 million years ago, leading to the formation of the separate continents currently on Earth. This process also caused massive volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which shaped Earth's current geological features. \n",
      "Pannotia, also known as the Vendian supercontinent, was a hypothetical supercontinent that existed during the Neoproterozoic era. It formed approximately 633 million years ago and lasted until around 573 million years ago, breaking apart to create unique features on the continents we know today. Geologists proposed the concept of Pannotia in the early 1990s based on geological and paleomagnetic evidence. Pannotia was at the South Pole, and a global ocean, which had surrounded the earlier Rodinia, enclosed the landmass, which is how it first formed. The supercontinent consisted of present-day South America, Arabia, Antarctica, Australia, and parts of Asia. The breakup of Pannotia contributed to the formation of new oceans, such as the Iapetus Ocean and the Proto-Tethys Ocean. The separation also triggered significant evolutionary events, including the Cambrian explosion, which saw increased biodiversity. Rodinia A proposed reconstruction of the supercontinent Rodinia. John Goodge, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Rodinia was another supercontinent that existed approximately 1.1 billion years ago during the Neoproterozoic era. It was another potential precursor to the better-known Pangea. The continent formed through collisions between smaller land masses, eventually covering almost one-third of the planet's surface. It was one of the first Precambrian supercontinents identified and was named Pangaea I at first. The vast landmass altered ocean currents, leading to changes in sea level and weather patterns. The continent also provided new habitats for early life forms, allowing for diversification and evolution. Geologists need to learn more about Rodinia despite its significance due to limited geological evidence. Scientists continue to study the matter using various methods, including seismic imaging and computer modeling. Columbia (Nuna) \n",

      "A concave mirror \u001b[92m\"is a curved mirror where the reflecting surface is on the inner side of the curved shape\" [1]\u001b[0m. It \u001b[92m\"can form both real and virtual images\" [2]\u001b[0m. A real image is \u001b[95m\"formed by rays that converge on a real location\" [3]\u001b[0m and can be projected onto a screen.

      "On the other hand, a spherical mirror exhibits a consistent curvature. It possesses a constant radius of curvature (In the context of spherical mirrors, the radius of curvature refers to the distance between the centre of the spherical mirror and its curved surface.). Spherical mirrors can create both real and virtual images, depending on the position of the object and the mirror. Spherical mirrors are further categorized into concave and convex mirrors, each with distinct properties and image formation characteristics. In the upcoming sections, we will detail the characteristics of convex and concave mirrors, along with a comprehensive understanding of the images formed by these mirrors when the object is placed at various positions with the help of ray diagrams. Characteristics of Concave and Convex Mirrors Concave Mirror Definition A concave mirror is a curved mirror where the reflecting surface is on the inner side of the curved shape. It has a surface that curves inward, resembling the shape of the inner surface of a hollow sphere. Concave mirrors are also converging mirrors because they cause light rays to converge or come together after reflection. Depending on the position of the object and the mirror, concave mirrors can form both real and virtual images. Characteristics of Concave Mirrors Converging Mirror: A concave mirror is often referred to as a converging mirror because when light rays strike and reflect from its reflecting surface, they converge or come together at a specific point known as the focal point. This property of concave mirrors allows them to focus light to a point. Magnification and Image Formation: When a concave mirror is placed very close to the object, it forms a magnified, erect, and virtual image. The image appears larger than the actual object and is upright. The virtual image is formed as the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point behind the mirror. Changing Distance and Image Properties: As the distance between the object and the concave mirror increases, the size of the image decreases. Eventually, at a certain distance, the image transitions from virtual to real. In this case, a real and inverted image is formed on the opposite side of the mirror. Versatile Image Formation: Concave mirrors have the ability to create images that can vary in size, from small to large, and in nature, from real to virtual. These characteristics make concave mirrors useful in various applications such as telescopes, shaving mirrors, and reflecting headlights. Convex Mirror Definition \n",
      "Virtual, Erect, and Diminished Images: Regardless of the distance between the object and the convex mirror, the images formed are always virtual, erect, and diminished. The image appears upright, smaller than the actual object, and behind the mirror. When traced backwards, the virtual image is formed by the apparent intersection of diverging rays. Wide Field of View: One of the significant characteristics of convex mirrors is their ability to provide a wide field of view. Due to the outwardly curved shape, convex mirrors can reflect a broader area compared to flat or concave mirrors. This property makes them useful when a larger perspective is required, such as in parking lots, intersections, or surveillance systems. \n",
      "For a (refracting) lens, the real image of an object is formed on the opposite side of the lens while the virtual image is formed on the same side as the object. For a (reflecting) mirror, the real image is on the same side as the object while the virtual image is on the opposite side of, or 'behind', the mirror. In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays (forming virtual images) are conventionally represented by dotted lines, to contrast with the solid lines of real rays. Because the rays never really converge, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen by putting it at the location of the virtual image. In contrast, a real image can be projected on the screen as it is formed by rays that converge on a real location. A real image can be projected onto a diffusely reflecting screen so people can see the image (the image on the screen plays as an object to be imaged by human eyes). \n",
      "(a, b) The focal length for the concave mirror in (a), formed by converging rays, is in front of the mirror, and has a positive value. The focal length for the convex mirror in (b), formed by diverging rays, appears to be behind the mirror, and has a negative value. Images formed by a concave mirror vary, depending on which side of the focal point the object is placed. For any object placed on the far side of the focal point with respect to the mirror, the rays converge in front of the mirror to form a real image, which can be projected onto a surface, such as a screen or sheet of paper However, for an object located inside the focal point with respect to the concave mirror, the image is virtual. For a convex mirror the image is always virtual—that is, it appears to be behind the mirror. The ray diagrams in Figure 16.10 show how to determine the nature of the image formed by concave and convex mirrors. Figure 16.10 \n",
      "Using a concave mirror, you look at the reflection of a faraway object. The image size changes if you move the object closer to the mirror. Why does the image disappear entirely when the object is at the mirror's focal point? The height of the image became infinite. The height of the object became zero. The intensity of intersecting light rays became zero. The intensity of intersecting light rays increased. The Application of the Curved Mirror Equations The Application of the Curved Mirror Equations Curved mirrors and the images they create involve a fairly small number of variables: the mirror’s radius of curvature, R; the focal length, f; the distances of the object and image from the mirror, do and di, respectively; and the heights of the object and image, ho and hi, respectively. The signs of these values indicate whether the image is inverted, erect (upright), real, or virtual. We now look at the equations that relate these variables and apply them to everyday problems. \n",
      "A concave mirror can't form an enlarged real image. Real images in concave mirrors get smaller as the object moves away from the mirror. Hence, a concave mirror cannot produce an enlarged real image. It can only produce a reduced real image. 04 Analyzing a Concave Mirror Creating an Enlarged Virtual Image An enlarged virtual image is formed when an object is placed between the focal point and the mirror in a concave mirror. It is magnified and appears upright, on the same side as the object. The virtual image appears behind the mirror, while the object is in front. This is why makeup mirrors, which are concave, make the face appear larger than it actually is. Key Concepts These are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question. Reduced Real Image Understanding how a concave mirror forms a reduced real image is essential when studying optics. Essentially, a real image is formed when reflected light rays converge at a point to produce an image that can be projected on a screen. In the case of a reduced real image, the object must be positioned beyond the center of curvature (C) of the concave mirror. The image will be formed between C and the focal point (F), appearing reduced in size and inverted.In practical terms, this means that if you were to place an object, like a candle, at a distance greater than the mirror's radius of curvature, the image reflected back would be smaller compared to the object itself. This principle is used in various optical instruments, such as telescopes and cameras, to capture details of distant objects. By adjusting the distance between the object and the mirror, one can precisely control the size of the image produced. Virtual Image Magnification Virtual images produced by concave mirrors are a bit different from their real counterparts. A virtual image occurs when the object is within the focal length of the mirror, specifically between the focal point (F) and the mirror itself. Unlike a real image, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen because the light rays do not actually meet but appear to diverge from a common point.With magnification, the virtual image is larger than the object, and it appears upright. This phenomenon can be witnessed when using a shaving or makeup mirror, where the magnified image allows for a close-up view of the face. The level of magnification can be quite significant, making detailed tasks easier. To understand why the image is magnified, consider that a virtual image's size depends on the angle at which the light rays appear to be coming from; closer placement to the mirror results in a wider angle and thus, a larger image.

      "Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, the underlying process is often similar. The process in the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypothetical explanations), deriving predictions from the hypotheses as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. A hypothesis is a conjecture based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested. \n",
      "The scientific method is the process by which science is carried out. As in other areas of inquiry, science (through the scientific method) can build on previous knowledge, and can unify understanding of its topics of study over time.[g] This model can be seen to underlie the scientific revolution. The overall process involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct. However, there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, these actions are better considered as general principles. Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always done in the same order. As noted by scientist and philosopher William Whewell (1794–1866), 'invention, sagacity, [and] genius' are required at every step. \n",
      "The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, imagination, and creativity. In this sense, it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow but is rather an ongoing cycle, constantly developing more useful, accurate, and comprehensive models and methods. For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's Principia. On the contrary, if the astronomically massive, the feather-light, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories – all phenomena Newton could not have observed – Newton's equations are what remain. Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase confidence in Newton's work. An iterative, pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding: Define a question Gather information and resources (observe) Form an explanatory hypothesis \n",
      "Hypothesis development Main article: Hypothesis formation Linus Pauling proposed that DNA might be a triple helix. This hypothesis was also considered by Francis Crick and James D. Watson but discarded. When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data that Pauling was wrong. and that Pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon, or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena. Normally, hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model. Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as existential statements, stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of universal statements, stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic. Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have – their own creativity, ideas from other fields, inductive reasoning, Bayesian inference, and so on – to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. Albert Einstein once observed that 'there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles.'[i] Charles Sanders Peirce, borrowing a page from Aristotle (Prior Analytics, 2.25) described the incipient stages of inquiry, instigated by the 'irritation of doubt' to venture a plausible guess, as abductive reasoning.: II, p.290  The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a 'flash of inspiration', or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. Michael Polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology. William Glen observes that the success of a hypothesis, or its service to science, lies not simply in its perceived 'truth', or power to displace, subsume or reduce a predecessor idea, but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate ... bald suppositions and areas of vagueness.— William Glen, The Mass-Extinction Debates In general, scientists tend to look for theories that are 'elegant' or 'beautiful'. Scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is following the known facts but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle. Occam's Razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses. To minimize the confirmation bias that results from entertaining a single hypothesis, strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses, and avoiding artifacts. Predictions from the hypothesis \n",
      "Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those experimenting. Detailed record-keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure. They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results, likely by others. Traces of this approach can be seen in the work of Hipparchus (190–120 BCE), when determining a value for the precession of the Earth, while controlled experiments can be seen in the works of al-Battani (853–929 CE) and Alhazen (965–1039 CE).[l][b] Communication and iteration See also: Scientific literature and Scholarly communication The scientific method is iterative. At any stage, it is possible to refine its accuracy and precision, so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject under consideration. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method, the hypothesis, or the definition of the subject. \n",
      "The idea of there being two opposed justifications for truth has shown up through-out the history of scientific method as analysis versus synthesis, non-ampliative/ampliative, or even confirmation and verification. (And there are other kinds of reasoning.) One to use what is observed to build towards fundamental truths – and the other to derive from those fundamental truths more specific principles. Deductive reasoning is the building of knowledge based on what has been shown to be true before. It requires the assumption of fact established prior, and, given the truth of the assumptions, a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion. Inductive reasoning builds knowledge not from established truth, but from a body of observations. It requires stringent scepticism regarding observed phenomena, because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of initial perceptions. \n",
      "Confirmatory research is research that starts with a well-defined research question and a priori hypotheses before collecting data; confirmatory research can also be called hypothesis testing research. In contrast, researchers pursuing exploratory research collect data and then examine the data for potential variables of interest and relationships among variables, forming a posteriori hypotheses; as such, exploratory research can be considered hypothesis generating research. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses are often described as two different stages of the research process. Some have distinguished between the 'context of discovery' and the 'context of justification' (Reichenbach, 1938), while others have argued that the distinction is on a spectrum rather than categorical. Regardless of the precise line between exploratory and confirmatory research, researchers’ choices between the two affects how they and others interpret the results. \n",

      "Tropical rainforests ecosystems are distinguished by their consistent, high temperatures, exceeding 18°C monthly, and substantial annual rainfall. The abundant rainfall results in nutrient-poor, leached soils, which profoundly affect the flora and fauna adapted to these conditions. These rainforests are renowned for their significant biodiversity. They are home to 40%-75% of all species globally, including half of the world's animal and plant species, and two-thirds of all flowering plant species. Their dense insect population and variety of trees and higher plants are notable. Described as the 'world's largest pharmacy,' over a quarter of natural medicines have been discovered in them. However, tropical rainforests are threatened by human activities, such as logging and agricultural expansion, leading to habitat fragmentation and loss. \n",
      "Tropical rainforests have existed on earth for hundreds of millions of years. Most tropical rainforests today are on fragments of the Mesozoic era supercontinent of Gondwana. The separation of the landmass resulted in a great loss of amphibian diversity while at the same time the drier climate spurred the diversification of reptiles. The division left tropical rainforests located in five major regions of the world: tropical America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and New Guinea, with smaller outliers in Australia. However, the specifics of the origin of rainforests remain uncertain due to an incomplete fossil record. Other types of tropical forest Main article: Tropical forest Several biomes may appear similar-to, or merge via ecotones with, tropical rainforest: Hawaiian tropical rainforest seen from the Hana Highway Moist seasonal tropical forest Daintree rainforest in Queensland is a seasonal tropical forest. Moist seasonal tropical forests receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. These forests usually fall under tropical monsoon or tropical savanna climates. Some trees in these forests drop some or all of their leaves during the winter dry season, thus they are sometimes called 'tropical mixed forest'. They are found in parts of South America, in Central America and around the Caribbean, in coastal West Africa, parts of the Indian subcontinent, and across much of Indochina. Montane rainforests These are found in cooler-climate mountainous areas, becoming known as cloud forests at higher elevations. Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between 1500 and 2500 m while the upper limit is usually from 2400 to 3300 m. Flooded rainforests Tropical freshwater swamp forests, or 'flooded forests', are found in Amazon basin (the Várzea) and elsewhere. Forest structure \n",
      "Tropical rainforests are located around and near the equator, therefore having what is called an equatorial climate characterized by three major climatic parameters: temperature, rainfall, and dry season intensity. Other parameters that affect tropical rainforests are carbon dioxide concentrations, solar radiation, and nitrogen availability. In general, climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. However, the abundance of rainfall changes throughout the year creating distinct moist and dry seasons. Tropical forests are classified by the amount of rainfall received each year, which has allowed ecologists to define differences in these forests that look so similar in structure. According to Holdridge's classification of tropical ecosystems, true tropical rainforests have an annual rainfall greater than 2 m and annual temperature greater than 24 degrees Celsius, with a potential evapotranspiration ratio (PET) value of <0.25. \n",
      "Tropical rainforests exhibit a vast diversity in plant and animal species. The root for this remarkable speciation has been a query of scientists and ecologists for years. A number of theories have been developed for why and how the tropics can be so diverse. Interspecific competition Interspecific competition results from a high density of species with similar niches in the tropics and limited resources available. Species which 'lose' the competition may either become extinct or find a new niche. Direct competition will often lead to one species dominating another by some advantage, ultimately driving it to extinction. Niche partitioning is the other option for a species. This is the separation and rationing of necessary resources by utilizing different habitats, food sources, cover or general behavioral differences. A species with similar food items but different feeding times is an example of niche partitioning. Pleistocene refugia \n",
      "In order to discuss why we have a flu season, we must first understand what the flu is. The flu, also called influenza, is a viral respiratory illness. A virus is a microscopic infectious agent that invades the cells of your body and makes you sick. The flu is often confused with another virus, the common cold, because of the similarity in symptoms, which can include a cough, sore throat, and stuffy nose. However, flu symptoms also include fever, cold sweats, aches throughout the body, headache, exhaustion, and even some gastro-intestinal symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea (1). The flu is highly contagious. Adults are able to spread the virus one day prior to the appearance of symptoms and up to seven days after symptoms begin. Influenza is typically spread via the coughs and sneezes of an infected person (1). Around 200,000 people in the United States are hospitalized each year because of the flu, and of these people, about 36,000 die.  The flu is most serious for the elderly, the very young, or people who have a weakened immune system (1). The Flu Season The flu season in the U.S. can begin as early as October, but usually does not get into full swing until December. The season generally reaches its peak in February and ends in March (2). In the southern hemisphere, however, where winter comes during our summer months, the flu season falls between June and September. In other words, wherever there is winter, there is flu (3). In fact, even its name, 'influenza' may be a reference to its original Italian name, influenza di freddo, meaning 'influence of the cold' (4). \n",
      "When the ITCZ is to the south of the equator, the north-east winds prevail over Nigeria, producing the dry-season conditions. When the ITCZ moves into the Northern Hemisphere, the south westerly wind prevails far inland to bring rainfall during the wet season. The result is a prolonged rainy season in the far south of Nigeria, while the far north undergoes long dry periods annually. Nigeria, therefore, has two major seasons, the dry season and the wet season, the lengths of which vary from north to south. In southern Nigeria, Lagos averages 68.5' (1740 mm) of rain annually. The four observed seasons are: The long rainy season, which lasts from March to the end of July, with a peak period in June over most parts of southern Nigeria. The short dry season, which is in August and lasts for 3-4 weeks. This is due to the ITCZ moving to the north of the region. The short rainy season, which lasts from early September to mid-October as the ITCZ moves south again, with a peak period at the end of September. The rains are not usually as heavy as those in the long rainy season. The long dry season starts, which starts late October and lasts to early March, with peak dry conditions between early December and late February. Vegetation growth is generally hampered, grasses dry, and leaves fall from deciduous trees due to reduced moisture. Chart showing the monthly normal rainfall for Kano and Lagos, Nigeria. Download Image In northern Nigeria, Kano averages 32.5' (825 mm) of rain annually, about half the amount in Lagos. There are only two seasons because the ITCZ only moves into the region once a year before returning south. The two observed seasons are: \n",

      "Hey there DOOL fans. Today, we are gonna answer a question that keeps popping up wherever we look, and it is about Hope Brady’s mom. If you’re enjoying seeing her back on Days, you’re not the only one. Fans are thrilled to have Kristian Alfonso back. But her and Bo Brady’s return has prompted a bunch of questions about her past that some fans have forgotten. We’re gonna dig into that. Now, let’s dig into one of the most common questions about the legacy character… One that we keep seeing right now all over the place, and that is, who was Hope Brady’s mother on Days of our Lives? If you don’t remember, here’s a little slice of history for you. We promise we’ll keep it hot and interesting. Her mother’s name was Adelaide Horton Williams. She was commonly known as Addie Horton. She was played by both Patricia Huston and Patricia Barry way, way, way back in the days, we’re talking pre-1970s, 60s era. If you know Salem Town Square, you know it’s Horton Square, named for Tom and Alice Horton. \n",
      "Now, the big question is, since Julie is married to Hope’s dad, what happened to mom, Addie? When Hope was newborn, she was a newborn being pushed around in a baby carriage. And there was a car about to hit the baby carriage. So, her mom, Addie, intervened and threw herself in front of the baby stroller and was struck by the car instead. And those injuries killed her. She died in the spring of 1974, not long after her little girl was born. So, Hope never really knew her mother. And that was obviously a tiny actress then on Days of our Lives. Now, Hope Brady’s mom, Adelaide Horton Williams, has been dead for decades. Not long after his wife’s death, Doug married Julie, his former stepdaughter. And the young girl was then shipped off to boarding school. Hope Came Back Grown from Boarding School on Days of our Lives Hope Brady returned as a gorgeous young adult in the eighties to huge storylines. They did a whole SORAS recast (Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome. Then, with Kristian Alfonso in the role, we got the big romance of Hope Williams and Bo Brady. They were star-crossed lovers that became a super couple. You know, they were on and off like all big couples on all soap operas. But that came to an end a decade ago when Bo Brady died of complications of brain cancer. However, Days of our Lives has now done a retcon and changed that. We know they love resurrections. Salem should be full of zombies by now, with as many dead people as they’ve brought back. So, Bo was dead for a decade, but Megan Hathaway kept him in cold storage and then revived him. Of course, Megan’s another who’s supposed to be dead. Fans cheered at the return of Kristian Alfonso and Peter Reckell coming back to Days of our Lives, but we have some bad news about their return. \n",
      "Hope Brady is one of the most popular characters to ever appear on 'Days of Our Lives.' The character, played by Kristian Alfonso until 2020, has seemingly been through it all. In 1983 the character of Hope Williams was aged into a young adult and she was quickly paired with Bo Brady (Peter Reckell) for a romantic relationship (via Soap Central). Fans immediately fell in love with Bo and Hope as a couple, and over the years they cemented themselves as one of the best daytime soap couples of all time (via We Love Soaps). Advertisement \n",

Kanye went on to create the Yeezy range that became iconic around the world. adidas Yeezy Boost 750 Released in 2015, Yeezy Season 1 kicked off with the adidas Yeezy Boost 750, Kanye’s first official adidas sneaker. These high-top sneakers featured a full suede upper, the infamous cross-strap, a full-length zipper and a tech upgrade with the iconic BOOST sole.

      "Continuing to switch things up, the Yeezy 500 came as the first Yeezy not featuring a BOOST midsole. These sneakers came with the 'Feet You Wear' sole, which has a 20-year history. The sole originally debuted on Kobe Bryant’s signature adidas KB8 III sneaks in ’99 – primarily to help b-ballers avoid rolling their ankles on the court. The oversized look of the sole now fits in perfectly with the chunky sneaker trend. Teasing the sneaker throughout 2017, with Kanye appearing in public wearing the previously unseen silhouette, it wasn’t until April of 2018 that the kicks saw a drop in the ‘Desert Rat’ colorway.

      "Adidas Yeezy (or just Yeezy) was a fashion collaboration between American rapper, designer, and entrepreneur Kanye West's[a] Yeezy and German sportswear company Adidas. It offered sneakers in limited edition colorways, as well as shirts, jackets, track pants, socks, slides, lingerie and slippers. The first shoe model ('Boost 750') was released in February 2015. In 2020 Forbes described Yeezy's rise as 'one of the great retail stories of the century'. Yeezy influenced and inspired a multitude of other fashion brands. Outside of the former Adidas collaboration, Yeezy is the name of Kanye's company Yeezy LLC and is not connected to Adidas. In October 2022, Adidas announced that it terminated its collaboration with West with immediate effect after the rapper made antisemitic remarks through various media outlets. History Proposed 'Pastelle' line and 2006 meeting American rapper Kanye West had collaborated with Nike before his partnership with Adidas. \n",
      "In February 2015, the Adidas and West collaboration officially debuted. 'Yeezy Season 1' was highly anticipated and celebrities such as Rihanna, Diddy, and West's then-wife Kim Kardashian were at the introductory fashion show. The line featured heavy inspiration from military designs, which West had stated was driven by 2011 England riots. Bomber jackets, sweatpants, and stylized military jackets were heavily featured in the Yeezy Season 1 collection. While the fashion show started late, many deemed it as a success. \n",
      "'Yeezy Season 1' was released on October 29, 2015, and was the first apparel collection to release from this collaboration. The presentation was designed in collaboration with performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, who has previously worked with West on music videos and set designs. This collection was noted for its stripped-down, ready-to-wear style, which drew on military clothing and flesh-toned colors. The prices ranged from $600 for sweatpants to $3,000 for jackets. Although the footwear sold out quickly, the apparel collection did not. West revealed in a 2018 interview that he was in talks with Louis Vuitton for a $30 million apparel deal. The deal was not approved by the LVMH board and West was left with no clothing partners. After the 'Yeezy Season 1' show, Adidas announced it would no longer be a part of Yeezy apparel, instead focusing on the footwear collection with West.[citation needed] \n",

      "After a five-year collaboration, and after the release of the Yeezy I and Yeezy II sneaker designs, Kanye ended his partnership with Nike. This came right after the release of the Air Yeezy 2s. Instead of paying royalties for Kanye’s designs, Nike decided to donate his earnings to a charity of his choice. Lucky for Kanye, this wasn’t the last time that he was approached for a partnership. After leaving Nike, Kanye was approached by Adidas, who, unlike Nike, offered to pay royalties for his designs (a 15% wholesale royalty). For Kanye, this felt like more of a true partnership between two brands. 2015: Yeezy’s initial releases and Yeezy’s partnership with Adidas The first shoe that Kanye released was the Yeezy Boost 750. For this sneaker, Kanye got his inspiration from a futuristic shoe design he saw in Australia. A limited-edition 'Light Brown' version of the shoe followed this initial release, and the 9,000 pairs sold out within 10 minutes. \n",
      "Yeezy sneakers were popular with everyone, athletes included. Kanye decided to create a line of sneakers specifically for football which debuted in an NFL kickoff game in 2016. While the athletes loved these, DeAndre Hopkins, a wide receiver on the Houston Texas, was fined $6,000 by the NFL for having these Yeezy 350 Cleats on. That’s because when the cleats were designed, they did not have a strong enough base color, which is part of the NFL’s kit policy. During this same year, Yeezy released even more color schemes (like Beluga, Zebra, Black and White, and Cream White) for its highly successful Yeezy Boost 350 line, during the third season of Yeezy. Beyond updating the colors, the Yeezy brand also updated the structural components of the shoe and eliminated the heel tab. 2017: The Yeezy Powerphase Calabasas & Yeezy Boost 700 \n",
      "Unlike sneakers that were designed outside of United States, this Adidas Yeezy sneaker was designed in the States. The brand sold this directly on its website in June 2020 for a price of $75, cheaper than their past shoe designs. This sneaker was different because Kanye had the idea to use harvested algae for some elements of the shoes, making it even more unique. 2021: The Yeezy 450 & Yeezy 500 The Yeezy brand continued its partnership with Adidas, which became an unstoppable collaboration.  The duo released the Yeezy 450 in March 2021. This was released in a 'cloud white,' color before being released in a dark gray.

      "The Office is an American mockumentary sitcom television series based on the 2001–2003 BBC series of the same name created by (and starring) Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Adapted for NBC by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons, the show depicts the everyday work lives of office employees at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, and aired from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, with a total of nine seasons consisting of 201 episodes. The show was co-produced by Daniels' Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions (later Shine America), in association with Universal Television. The original executive producers were Daniels, Gervais, Merchant, Howard Klein and Ben Silverman, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons. \n",
      "The Office received moderately positive reviews from critics (except for the pilot episode which received mixed reviews) during its short first season, but the following seasons, particularly Carell's performance, received significant acclaim from television critics as the show's characters, content, structure, and tone diverged considerably from the original British series. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards including a Peabody Award in 2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for Outstanding Comedy Series, in 2006. The eighth season was criticized for a decline in quality, with Carell's departure in season seven seen as a contributing factor. However, the ninth and final season ended the series with a generally positive response. The series finale, which originally aired on May 16, 2013, was viewed by an estimated 5.7 million viewers and garnered critical acclaim. In 2016, Rolling Stone named The Office one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time. Greg Daniels developed the British Office series for American television and served as the showrunner for the first four seasons of the series. He then left the position when he co-created the comedy series Parks and Recreation with fellow Office writer Michael Schur and divided his time between both series. Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta were named the showrunners for the fifth season. Celotta left the series after the sixth season and Lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons. He left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential Dwight Schrute spin-off, The Farm, which was eventually passed on by NBC. Daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season. Other executive producers include cast members B. J. Novak and Mindy Kaling. Kaling, Novak, Daniels, Lieberstein and Schur made up the original team of writers. Kaling, Novak, and Lieberstein also served multiple roles on the series, as they played regular characters on the show, as well as wrote, directed, and produced episodes. Credited with twenty-four episodes, Kaling is the most prolific writer among the staff. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British series, are credited as executive producers and wrote both pilot and the third-season episode 'The Convict'. Merchant later directed the episode 'Customer Survey', while Gervais appeared in the episodes 'The Seminar' and 'Search Committee', reprising his role as David Brent from the British series. \n",
      "When it came to choosing the theme music for The Office, producer Greg Daniels had several tracks he was thinking of using: existing songs including 'Better Things' by The Kinks, 'Float On' by Modest Mouse, and 'Mr. Blue Sky' by Electric Light Orchestra, and several original pieces artists contributed to the producers via a cattle call. Daniels decided that the cast would vote on what song to use and gave them four of the choices. Most of them wanted 'Mr. Blue Sky', but that option turned out to be invalid as it was already used in the drama series LAX (2004–2005). Thus, the final choice was an original track written by Jay Ferguson and performed by The Scrantones. \n",
      "For many viewers, The Office is also what made Steve Carell a star. Before he starred in comedies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Anchorman, Carell was Michael Scott on The Office. The show, which is also known as one of the first series to popularize the mockumentary-style comedy, has also been nominated for dozens of Emmys and won Outstanding Comedy Series in 2006. While it’s critical and commercial success was a plug, we’re also sure that The Office cast salary wasn’t bad either. Find out how much six of the main cast members made when the show was on air ahead. Steve Carell Image: Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $80 million Salary: $175,000 per episode It’s no secret that Carell was the breakout star from The Office. After the show’s first season in 2003, Carell booked roles in blockbuster films like Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Evan Almighty. While he’s a household name now, Carell, who played Dunder Mifflin Regional Manager Michael Scott, didn’t have the same star-level salary in season 1 of The Office. It’s reported that the actor made $87,000 per episode for seasons 1 and 2 before a raise to $175,000 per episode for season 3. It’s unclear what Carell made for the other six seasons, but even if he did still have that $175,000 per episode rate, he would’ve raked in around $3.5 million each season, which is more than a lot of other hit shows out there. Celebrity Net Worth reports that he’s worth $80 million. John Krasinski Image: Chris Haston/Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $30 million Salary: $100,000 per episode \n",
      "Fischer played Dunder Mifflin receptionist Pam Beesly. According to Cheat Sheet, Fischer was also included in the $20,000 per episode pay scale for the series’ first three seasons. By season 4, her salary was raised to $100,000 per episode, which would’ve paid her close to $2.8 million per season by The Office‘s end. While on The Office, Fischer starred in films like Blades of Glory and Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. According to Celebrity Net Worth, she’s worth $16 million. Rainn Wilson Image: Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $14 million Salary: $100,000 per episode \n",
      "Angela Kinsey, known for her role as Angela Martin, has a net worth of $8 million and has continued to work on other projects. The lovable secretary Pam Beesly, played by Jenna Fischer, has a net worth of $12 million and has appeared in other comedies alongside The Office. The ninth and final season of The Office ended in 2013, but fans would continue to stream the show on Netflix for years, making the comedy one of the most-watched shows on the streaming platform. It would later move to Peacock, the streaming service for NBCUniversal - and once again, fans just kept binging the sensation. It's safe to say, The Office is a beloved piece of programming, and that is certainly reflected in its stars' bank accounts. Over the years, most of the main cast members from The Office have continued to work and grow their net worths since the show. Steve Carell, for one, is now an Oscar-nominated movie star, and went on to act in hits like The Morning Show and Space Force. John Krasinski, meanwhile, has become a renowned director (hello, A Quiet Place) and action hero in Jack Ryan.

      "Sir Elton Hercules John (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 'Billboard' Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single 'Candle in the Wind 1997', rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, 'Empty Sky', was released. In 1970, his first hit single, 'Your Song', from his second album, 'Elton John', reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for 'The Lion King' and its stage adaptation, 'Aida' and 'Billy Elliot the Musical'. John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, 'Rolling Stone' ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, 'Billboard' ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the 'Billboard' Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for 'services to music and charitable services' in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over £300 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. Presenting John with France's highest civilian award, the Legion d'honneur, in 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called him a 'melodic genius' and praised his work on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2018, John embarked on a three-year farewell tour. \n",

This was the first film version of the play since 1931 and it was felt to be a rather odd choice, as the subject matter which had been considered controversial and provocative a generation earlier now appeared somewhat anachronistic in light of the major changes which had taken place in British society in the interim, particularly the more liberal attitudes growing from the national experience during World War II when previous taboos had been relaxed to a significant degree. The film was felt to be dated, even by 1952 standards, and the incongruity of supposed Lancashire mill-workers speaking in cut-glass Mayfair tones was also singled out as an absurdity. \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[92m\"Because blood is being moved away from your digestive system, your appetite may not be as big as it usually is\" [1]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"You might also feel sick to your stomach\" [2]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "If you or a loved one has heart failure, you probably know how important good daily habits are to treatment. A healthy weight, active lifestyle, and proper medication are all key ways to take charge of the disease. But even you've been carefully following doctor's orders, it's crucial to keep an eye out for the return of symptoms. That's because heart failure can be under control for a time and then become an issue again. Keep up with your regular checkups, and know which symptoms may mean your treatment needs to be tweaked. When your heart can't properly fill and empty, blood backs up in your veins. This causes fluid to leak into your lungs. Your doctor may call it pulmonary edema. This can make it hard to breathe during activities, rest, or even sleep. A sudden lack of breath might wake you up. You may need to prop yourself up with extra pillows to breathe easier. This constant search for air can leave you tired and anxious. When your heart doesn't pump right, the body starts to move blood from less vital parts like your arms and legs to the centers for survival -- the heart and brain. This can leave you feeling exhausted after everyday activities. An ongoing wheeze or cough that brings up white or slightly blood-colored mucus can signal fluid building up in your lungs. Call the doctor if you notice it. Fluid can build up in your tissues just like it does in your lungs. As a result, your feet, ankles, legs, or belly may swell. Your shoes and socks to feel tight. You might notice a sudden weight gain. Because blood is being moved away from your digestive system, your appetite may not be as big as it usually is. You might also feel sick to your stomach. When your heart struggles to pump the right amount of blood, it may speed up to make up for it. This can lead to palpitations, which could cause your heart to race or feel like it's fluttering or throbbing. Unusual amounts of things like sodium in your blood can bring disorientation, confusion, or memory loss. If you've seen any of these seven red flags, get medical help right away. Waiting for symptoms to get worse can be dangerous. With the right care, you can keep things under control.\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[92m\"If you are experiencing a few of these symptoms, chances are that your level of stress is high\" [1]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"If left untreated, stress can lead to permanent feelings of helplessness and ineffectiveness\" [2]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"When stress interrupts your life, causing sleep problems or making you feel anxious and out of control, talk with your primary health care professional\" [3]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "Stress. We all live with it each day. But how do you react to daily stress? For some people, life's stressors cause them to become irritable, short-tempered, or unable to concentrate on tasks. Others have interrupted sleep (trouble falling asleep or waking early in the morning with racing thoughts). Then there are those who react by eating junk food -- and a lot of it! ( Remember - desserts is stressed spelled backward!) The good news: No matter how busy your schedule, it is possible to manage stress and keep it from ruining your life. Simply stated, stress describes the many demands and pressures that we all experience, to some degree, each day. These demands are physical, mental, emotional, or even chemical in nature. The word \"stress\" encompasses both the stressful situation, known as the stressor, and the symptoms you experience under stress, your stress response. The problem with stress is that it activates your sympathetic nervous system, stimulating the release of stress hormones throughout your body. These hormones give you super energy and cause other changes in the body such as the \"fight or flight\" response. The \"fight or flight\" response makes your heart beat faster. You might feel very nervous, making it difficult to breathe. Short term, the \"fight or flight\" response causes changes that allow you to handle sudden stressful events. When you face fear -- or even recall a stressful or frightening event from the past -- the resulting hormonal changes super-charge your body to a state of high arousal. This prepares you for action. But long-term stress can be particularly difficult. When stress hormones stay elevated over time, there is a gradual and steady stream of harmful changes to the body. Long-term stress can suppress the immune system, which may lead to the development of diseases. Stress can be positive or negative, depending on the situation. Positive stressors (called eustress) may include an upcoming wedding, the holidays, or pregnancy. On the other hand, negative stress (called distress) results in the full-blown stress response. If continuous, negative stress can lead to loss of productivity, health problems, and exhaustion. Stress symptoms vary greatly from one person to the next, but the most universal sign of stress is a feeling of being pressured or overwhelmed. Other symptoms include: Physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches, chest pains, nausea, and diarrhea, and a sensation of numbness or tingling in your hands, arms, and face.) Problems getting along with family members, friends, and teachers. Changes in behavior at home (short temper, unexplained anger, crying for no reason). Regression -- behavior that is not age-appropriate. Dysfunctional sleep patterns, including nightmares, too little sleep, difficulty falling asleep, or even oversleeping. Communication difficulty or personality changes, such as becoming withdrawn or requiring much more attention than usual. Impatience. If you are experiencing a few of these symptoms, chances are that your level of stress is high. If left untreated, stress can lead to permanent feelings of helplessness and ineffectiveness. Now that you understand more about stress and the symptoms, try the following these 6 tips to unwind, de-stress, and get back in control of your emotional state: Identify the sources of stress. Try to figure out what's causing your stress symptoms. Maybe you are overextended (too many commitments) and feel fatigued and irritable. Once you identify the sources of stress, try to minimize these as much as possible. Talk it out. Talk to a friend, family member, or therapist if your stress level is too high. Getting your feelings out without others judging you is crucial to good mental health. Take time out. Before you reach your breaking point, take time out for solitude. Take time to nurture yourself, away from the cares and responsibilities of the world. Find time for inner strength and emotional healing. Set limits. Never hesitate to say \"no\" before you take on too many commitments. Especially if you are balancing work and family, it's important to prioritize. Saying \"no\" can help bring your stress to a manageable level and give you more control over your life. Try exhaling. Breathing can measure and alter your psychological state, making a stressful moment increase or diminish in intensity. Often, people who are anxious or upset take shallow breaths and unconsciously hold them. By paying attention to your breathing, particularly exhaling during tense moments, you will feel more relaxed. Buy a bottle of inexpensive bubbles (in the toy section at most stores), and use it to learn how to exhale slowly. Breathing from your abdomen, blow through the bubble blower with a steady stream of breath. If you blow too hard or too softly, you won't get any bubbles. But smooth, steady breaths will produce a nice flow of bubbles. Use this breathing technique (without the bubbles) when you are feeling stressed. Exercise daily. Exercise is thought to increase the secretion of endorphins, naturally produced substances in the brain that induce feelings of peacefulness. Many studies show that exercise, along with the boosted endorphin levels, really does increase confidence and self-esteem and reduce tension. Exercise also acts as a displacement defense mechanism for those who are \"stressed out.\" What does that mean? If you've ever walked for several miles, you know how hard it is to think of your problems when your mind is focused on walking. The problem with stress is that it's cumulative. In other words, if you don't have a healthy way of responding to stress or counterbalancing the \"fight or flight\" response, constant exposure to stress hormones overloads the body. Changes in levels of hormones produced by daily stress can hurt your health. When stress levels increase, it results in an overproduction of stress hormones that weaken the immune system. This can lead to physical and psychological problems. Chronic, or long-term, stress often results in high anxiety, insomnia, depression, gastrointestinal problems, and can even lead to dependency on drugs and alcohol (a self-medication solution that makes an already bad problem worse). Some studies show that the hormones associated with chronic stress are linked to increased fat in the abdomen. That, in turn, increases the risk of chronic and serious illness such as diabetes. When stress interrupts your life, causing sleep problems or making you feel anxious and out of control, talk with your primary health care professional. He or she might recommend a professional therapist who can offer support and give you some practical lifestyle tips in how to manage stress without letting it take over your life\n",

      "Does tamoxifen help if you had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tamoxifen is \u001b[92m\"a pill that doctors have prescribed for more than 30 years to treat breast cancer\" [1]\u001b[0m. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the earliest form of breast cancer. Tamoxifen works by \u001b[92m\"keeping estrogen from attaching to the cancer cells\" [2]\u001b[0m. It \u001b[92m\"is an option for: Treatment of the earliest form of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), along with surgery\" [3]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "Hormones that every woman has in her body -- estrogen and progesterone -- can be fuel for some types of breast cancer. They help the cells grow and spread. Hormone therapy, also called endocrine therapy, adds, blocks, or removes those chemicals to treat the disease. There are two types of hormone therapy for breast cancer: Drugs that stop estrogen and progesterone from helping breast cancer cells grow Drugs or surgery to keep the ovaries from making the hormones Hormone therapy is different from hormone replacement therapy ( HRT), a treatment that adds hormones to the body to counter the effects of menopause. When you're diagnosed with breast cancer, your doctor will test cells from your tumor to see if they have parts on their surfaces called receptors that use estrogen or progesterone. If they do, it means that they depend on these hormones to grow. In that case, your doctor will probably recommend hormone therapy as part of your treatment plan. If you've already been treated for breast cancer, you might use hormone therapy to help keep it from coming back. It also helps lower your odds of getting new cancers in the other breast. Also, if you don't have the disease but have a family history of it, or genes that raise your risk, your doctor may recommend hormone therapy to lower your chances of getting it. Common hormone therapy drugs for breast cancer treatment include: Anastrozole ( Arimidex) Exemestane ( Aromasin) Fulvestrant ( Faslodex) Goserelin ( Zoladex) Letrozole ( Femara) Leuprorelin, leuprolide acetate ( Lupron) Megestrol ( Megace) Tamoxifen ( Nolvadex, Soltamox) Toremifene ( Fareston) Tamoxifen is a pill that doctors have prescribed for more than 30 years to treat breast cancer. It works by keeping estrogen from attaching to the cancer cells. Doctors first used tamoxifen to treat women whose breast cancer had spread in their bodies because it slowed or stopped the growth of the disease. The drug also lowers the chance that some early stage breast cancers will come back. And it can lower the risk that a woman will get cancer in her other breast later on. Women who are at high risk for breast cancer can take tamoxifen to try to lower their chances of getting the disease. It's an alternative to watchful waiting or having surgery to remove a breast, called a mastectomy, before they get the disease. Tamoxifen is an option for: Treatment of the earliest form of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS), along with surgery Treatment of abnormal cells in the glands that make milk, called lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS), to lessen the chance that they'll become more advanced breast cancer Treatment of breast cancer in men and women whose cancers use estrogen Treatment of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or that comes back after treatment To prevent breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease Some people should not use tamoxifen: Pregnant women Women planning to get pregnant Men or women who've had blood clots or a stroke Talk to your doctor to see if tamoxifen is right for you. For women, the side effects of tamoxifen are similar to some of the symptoms of menopause. Two of the most common ones are hot flashes and vaginal discharge. Other problems for women may include: Vaginal dryness or itching Irregular periods Headache Nausea and vomiting Skin rash Fatigue Water retention and weight gain The side effects may be similar to menopause, but tamoxifen doesn't trigger menopause. For men, tamoxifen can cause: Headache Nausea and vomiting Skin rash Sexual side effects like erectile dysfunction or a lower sex drive Yes. The risks include: Fertility. Tamoxifen can increase your fertility for a short time. But it might harm a growing baby, so it's important to use some form of barrier birth control while you're taking it, like condoms or a diaphragm. Don't use birth control pills. They can change how the drug works and affect the breast cancer. Tell your doctor right away if you think you've become pregnant while you're taking tamoxifen. Blood clots. Women who take tamoxifen may have a slightly higher risk of blood clots in their lungs or large veins. It's an even bigger risk for smokers. Stroke. Uterine cancer or sarcoma. The drug may make a woman more likely to get these diseases. But this risk is small, and it may be outweighed by the benefits of tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment. Talk to your doctor to know for sure. Cataracts. Tamoxifen seems to give some women a higher chance of having this condition, which clouds the lens inside the eye. People have also reported eye problems such as corneal scarring or retinal changes. Medications. Tamoxifen may affect how other drugs work in your body. A large study by the National Cancer Institute looked at whether tamoxifen lowered cases of breast cancer in healthy women who were known to be likely to get the disease. The results of the trial showed a 50% reduction in breast cancer in the women who took the drug. Studies have also shown that tamoxifen lessens the risk of breast cancer returning in women who have had the earliest form of the disease, ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS). Another drug, raloxifene ( Evista), which prevents the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis, is similar to tamoxifen. Studies have found that it prevents breast cancer in women who are at high risk, but with fewer side effects. The FDA has approved it for breast cancer prevention. Aromatase inhibitors: This type of hormone therapy drug keeps your body from breaking down testosterone into estrogen. They include: Anastrozole ( Arimidex) Exemestane ( Aromasin) Letrozole ( Femara) Aromatase inhibitors keep breast cancer from getting worse for longer than tamoxifen in women who have the advanced disease whose tumors rely on estrogen to grow. For women who have gone through menopause, the drugs can fight cancer even after it has spread to other parts of the body. They are pills that you take once a day. Side effects of aromatase inhibitors include: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea and constipation Hot flashes Headache Bone pain Severe fatigue Skin rash Swelling and water retention Flu-like symptoms Increased bone loss Fulvestrant ( Faslodex): This shot keeps estrogen from attaching to cancer cells. Common side effects include: Pain where you get the shot Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite Weakness and fatigue Hot flashes Cough Muscle, joint, and bone pain Constipation Shortness of breath\n",

      "Type 1 diabetes happens when your immune system destroys cells in your pancreas called beta cells. They're the ones that make insulin. Some people get a condition called secondary diabetes. It's similar to type 1, except the immune system doesn't destroy your beta cells. They're wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body's tissues. Cells use it as fuel. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Glucose doesn't move into your cells because insulin isn't there to do it. Instead it builds up in your blood and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar, which can lead to: Dehydration. When there's extra sugar in your blood, you pee more. That's your body's way of getting rid of it. A large amount of water goes out with that urine, causing your body to dry out. Weight loss. The glucose that goes out when you pee takes calories with it. That's why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. Dehydration also plays a part. Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA). If your body can't get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body can't use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This combination of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as \"ketoacidosis\" and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Damage to your body. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes, kidneys, and heart. They can also make you more likely to get hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. It's rare. Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. It's more common in whites than in African- Americans. It affects men and women equally. Although the disease usually starts in people under 20, it can happen at any age. Doctors don't know all the things that lead to type 1 diabetes. But they do know your genes play a role. They also know type 1 diabetes can result when something in the environment, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas. Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They're present in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases, like Grave's disease or vitiligo. These are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Heavy thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Nausea and vomiting Pain in your belly Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss (even though you're eating and feel hungry) Fatigue (weak, tired feeling) Blurred vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor will call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of the skin, urinary tract, or vagina Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Pain in your belly Loss of consciousness (rare) If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, he'll check your blood sugar levels. He may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don't have enough insulin. Right now there's no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Many people with type 1 diabetes live long, healthy lives. The key to good health is to keep your blood sugar levels within the range your doctor gives you. You'll need to check them often and adjust insulin, food, and activities to make that happen. All people with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, he'll mention three main things: \" Onset\" is the length of time before it reaches your bloodstream and begins lowering blood sugar. \" Peak time\" is the time when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering blood sugar. \" Duration\" is how long it keeps working after onset. Several types of insulin are available. Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks around 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps working for 3 to 6 hours. Intermediate-acting won't get into your bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after injection. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours and works for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts for about 24 hours. Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two different types of insulin. You may progress to three or four shots a day. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end, and give yourself the shot. Some now comes in a prefilled pen. One kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump -- a device you wear that sends it into your body via a small tube. Your doctor will help you to pick the type and the delivery method that's best for you. Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn't as simple as going out for a run. You have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Knowledge is power. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you. Some things will make your levels go up; others won't. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to prevent it from dropping too low. If your test is high, test for ketones -- acids that can result from high sugar levels. If they're OK, you should be good to go. If they're high, skip the workout. You'll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started. If you don't keep your type 1 diabetes well controlled, you could set yourself up for serious or life-threatening problems: Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. It's rare before puberty no matter how long you've had the disease. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Kidney damage. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chances grow over time. It's most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems like kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood circulation and nerve damage. Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of sensation in and a lack of blood supply to your feet. This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. And when that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n",

      "You can have a healthy pregnancy and delivery even if you have Crohn's disease. The key is to work closely with your doctor and follow your treatment plan so you and your baby can both stay healthy. If you're thinking about becoming pregnant, it's a good idea to make sure your Crohn's is in remission first. You have a better chance of a smooth pregnancy when your disease isn't flaring or when you haven't started a new treatment. Talk to both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist. Here are some things you may discuss before becoming pregnant: Medications for Crohn's don't usually affect a woman's chance of becoming pregnant. But some treatments -- such as sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) -- can affect a man's fertility. So men with Crohn's who hope to become fathers should talk to their doctors about changing medication. If you take methotrexate, your doctor will suggest you stop before your pregnancy. The drug can harm the baby. Men, too, should stop taking the drug several months before conception. If you are taking steroids, your doctor may suggest you wait to become pregnant. If you've had surgery for Crohn's you can still have a healthy pregnancy, but it may be harder to get pregnant. If you are thinking about having surgery, talk to your doctor. You may want to put off surgery until after your pregnancy. When you're pregnant, have regular visits with both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist to monitor your baby's health and your Crohn's. You should see a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine, because pregnancy with Crohn's is considered high risk. Some women say their Crohn's symptoms actually improve when they're pregnant and they have fewer flares. Make sure your doctors are aware of all the medications you are taking. If you're on a drug treatment plan that works for you, they may suggest you stay on it, but they may also suggest some changes to keep you and your baby safe. Tell your doctor if you take steroids, immunosuppressives, biologics, or even antibiotics, or anti-diarrhea drugs. You'll need to stop certain types of these drugs. Some medications, like sulfasalazine and other drugs in the aminosalicylate class, are considered safe while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. If you are thinking of becoming pregnant, you should consider adding folic acid supplements to your diet even before conception. These supplements will be needed throughout your pregnancy. You may need tests to monitor your Crohn's while you're pregnant. Some are OK, but there are other tests you may want to put off until after your baby is born. Your doctor can guide you on this decision. Ultrasounds, MRIs, and fetal monitoring devices are considered safe. If you are on steroids or have moderate to severe flares while pregnant, you may have frequent ultrasounds to check on your baby's growth. X-rays and CT scans may be necessary during pregnancy. To limit radiation exposure, abdominal shielding can be used. It's considered safe to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy, where a tube with a camera is placed in your colon to look for any problems. It is probably not a good idea to have a colonoscopy. The tests take a long time and patients usually get drugs to put them to sleep. You should also avoid X-rays and CT scans if possible. The radiation isn't good for a developing baby. Discuss your labor and delivery plans with your doctor well before your due date. If you have fistulas, abnormal passageways between organs, or other areas around your vagina or rectum that have been affected by Crohn's, your doctor may recommend you have a C-section. If you plan to breastfeed, talk to your doctor about your medications and if they're safe for your new baby. Breastfeeding shouldn't make your Crohn's worse, and it offers many health benefits to you and your baby.\n",

      "Some people with diabetes and the nerve pain -- or peripheral neuropathy that comes with it -- find relief in surprisingly simple ways. Sometimes a nice, warm (but not hot) bath is enough to relieve stress and nerve pain. If you have neuropathy, by the way, you might want to have someone else test the water to make sure it's not too hot. A massage can also help. Other people turn to biofeedback, meditation, relaxation techniques, or hypnosis -- all of which have been proven to help. \" These methods of alternative medicine have shown tremendous promise,\" says Tom Elasy, MD, director of the Diabetes Clinic at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. \" I have many patients who have pursued alternative approaches, and I get very positive feedback about the results.\" It is possible, through biofeedback, to train the body to decrease the severity of diabetes nerve pain. This involves consciously controlling a body function that is normally regulated by the body -- like skin temperature, heart rate, or blood pressure. It may sound like science fiction, but evidence of the benefits of biofeedback is quite good. It's been used to help control migraine pain, epilepsy seizures, high blood pressure, and other common problems. How does it work? You wear sensors on your head and elsewhere that let you \"hear\" or \"see\" certain bodily functions such as pulse, digestion, body temperature, and muscle tension. The squiggly lines and/or beeps on the attached monitors reflect what's going on inside your body. Then you learn to control those beeps and squiggles. After a few sessions, your mind has trained your biological system to learn the skills. It is not hard to master, say experts. Meditation is a therapy offered in many pain treatment centers for diabetes and other painful disorders. Research shows that meditation can lower blood pressure and improve heart rate, breathing, and brain waves. Tension and tightness seep from muscles as the body receives a quiet message to relax. The soothing power of repetition is at the heart of meditation. Focusing on the breath, ignoring thoughts, and repeating a word or phrase -- a mantra -- makes the body relax. People describe feeling warmth, calm, even a sense of heaviness while they meditate. While you can learn meditation on your own, it helps to take a class. A teacher can guide you -- and help you reach that deeper, more relaxed state. Stress can make neuropathy pain worse, so it is important to learn to relax. Your breathing pattern is often affected by changes in emotions. That's why managing your breathing is an important tool for relaxation. By becoming familiar with your own breathing patterns, you can learn to control your breathing, stress level, and pain as well. First, find a quiet location, a comfortable body position, and a good state of mind. Try to block out worries and distracting thoughts. Relaxation techniques to help with diabetes nerve pain include: Rhythmic breathing: Take long, slow breaths. Inhale slowly, and then exhale slowly. Count slowly to five as you inhale. Then count slowly to five as you exhale. Pay attention to how your body naturally relaxes. This will help you relax even more. Deep breathing: Imagine a spot just below your navel. Breathe into that spot, filling the abdomen with air. Let the air fill you from the abdomen up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. Visualized breathing: Find a comfortable place where you can close your eyes. Picture relaxation entering your body -- and tension leaving the body. Breathe deeply, but in a natural rhythm. Visualize the breath coming into your nostrils, going into your lungs. Picture it expanding your chest and abdomen. Then, visualize the breath going out the same way. Each time you exhale, imagine you are getting rid of a little more tension. Relax to music: Put on some music that lifts your mood and that you find soothing and calming. There are specially designed relaxation audio tapes or CDs that are perfect for this. Mental imagery relaxation: This is also called guided imagery. It is a form of \"mental escape\" in which you create calming, peaceful images in your mind. You also identify self-talk -- your thoughts about your illness -- and focus on positive thoughts and emotions instead. Self-hypnosis is the path to training both mind and body to make a desired change such as controlling diabetes pain. It is a skill that must be learned from a trained therapist and involves focusing attention for a desired purpose. With practice, hypnotizing yourself can be easy. You focus your attention on an image that blocks the perception of pain -- and you feel less pain. Your subconscious has grabbed hold of that message, replaying it time and again. The mind has learned to control the body. Scientists say hypnosis seems to block nerve pain receptors in the brain. Those receptors control sensations of pain, anxiety, and discomfort. Studies have shown that pain related to cancer, surgery, back injuries, and migraines responds well to hypnosis. A growing number of people are using acupuncture to treat neuropathy pain linked with diabetes and other health-related problems. What is acupuncture? It is a practice in which fine needles are inserted into the skin to stimulate specific points in the body. Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the theory that energy flows through the body along certain pathways, called âchi'. Illness or pain results when that energy is blocked or out of balance. The Chinese theory holds that acupuncture unblocks or balances that flow of energy. Many Western researchers say acupuncture may alter brain chemicals that affect the body and mind. Translated into the language of Western medicine, the healing power of acupuncture may come from its effect on the nervous system, on hormones, and on \"feel good\" brain chemicals called endorphins. One landmark study found that patients have reduced pain and improved movement with acupuncture. The National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization have both approved certain uses of acupuncture related to pain. Acupuncture also appears to be very safe. Relatively few complications from the use of acupuncture have been reported to the FDA even though millions of people are treated with acupuncture each year, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Still, poorly sterilized needles or improper treatments have caused some complications. It's important to make sure you go to well-trained and experienced acupuncturist. Your doctor may be able to help you with a recommendation.\n",

It can also help you steer clear of diabetes-related problems like: Heart disease Stroke High blood pressure High cholesterol Blindness Kidney disease Skin problems Self- Checking: Give yourself a blood sugar test as often as your doctor advises. To do it, you use a gadget that pricks your finger with a tiny needle. You'll put a drop of blood onto a test strip. The strip goes into a handheld device that measures your blood sugar level. Record the test results, so you can share it with your doctor. Based on your results, the two of you may adjust your diet, exercise, or medication. A1c Test: This is a blood test you'll get in your doctor's office at least twice a year, or as often as he recommends. The results show your average blood sugar control for the past 2 to 3 months. You and your doctor need this test to see how well your diabetes treatment plan is working, so you can make changes if you need to. Think of it this way: Self-checking is like a daily snapshot of your blood sugar control. The A1c test gives you the big picture. Continuous Glucose Monitoring System: If you choose this method, your doctor will place a tiny sensor under your skin to check blood sugar levels every 5 minutes. It sends data to a monitor that you wear like a pager for a few days. You'll still need to check your levels throughout the day; continuous glucose monitoring doesn't replace that. It gives your doctor more information about trends that self-checking might not show.\n",

When your body has too much of it, the excess hormone can throw off your body's other systems. Most cases of Cushing's syndrome can be cured, though it may take some time for your symptoms to ease up. The condition, also known as hypercortisolism, is more common in women than men. It's most often seen in people ages 25 to 40. You can get Cushing's syndrome when there's too much cortisol in your body for too long. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys. The most common cause is related to medications called glucocorticoids, also commonly known as steroids or prednisone. These prescription steroids are used for conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or after an organ transplant. They are powerful anti-inflammatory medications. Taking too much, for too long, can lead to Cushing's syndrome. A tumor in your pituitary gland, found at the base of the brain, or a tumor in the adrenal glands, can also prompt your body to make too much cortisol, which can lead to Cushing's. It's not usually a condition that's passed in families. In some rare cases, though, people develop it because a problem in their genes makes them more likely to get tumors on their glands. Your case might be different than someone else's, but when the disease is full-blown, common symptoms are: Rounded, rosy face Weight gain, especially upper body A fat pad in the upper back or base of the neck (you may hear this called a \"buffalo hump\") Thinning skin that is easy to bruise Acne Being very tired Weak muscles, especially when using your shoulders and hip muscles High blood pressure High blood sugar levels Depression and anxiety Osteoporosis Kidney stones Sleep problems Extra hair growth on your body and face Irregular periods Low sex drive and problems having an erection Your skin could become thin, heal slowly, and bruise easily. You might get purple or pink stretch marks all over your body, especially your belly, thighs, arms, and chest. Your bones may get weak. Everyday movements like bending, lifting, or even getting out of a chair can cause backaches or breaks in your ribs or spine. Children with Cushing's syndrome are usually very heavy, what doctors call obese, and tend to grow slowly. It might take several appointments to settle on your diagnosis. When you go to your doctor, she'll do a physical exam and ask you questions. What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Are you feeling more emotional? What medications are you taking? Your doctor will probably also recommend some of these tests to help screen for Cushing's syndrome if she suspects you have it: 24-hour urinary free cortisol test. This common test collects your urine for 24 hours to measure how much cortisol is in it. Dexamethasone suppression test . You'll take a low-dose steroid pill at 11:00 p.m. and then take a blood test in the morning to see how much cortisol your body still makes. Late-night salivary cortisol level. This test measures cortisol in your saliva. As the name suggests, these tests happen at night. If you have Cushing's syndrome, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who will do other blood tests or imaging scans to find out what's causing it. Will my symptoms change? If so, how? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? How will we know if they're working? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? When will I start to feel better? Does this condition put me at risk for any others? The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. That will lead to how to treat your condition. For instance, if you have too much cortisol because you're taking steroid medicines, your doctor will check to see if you can stop taking the drugs, or take a lower dose. If a tumor is causing your Cushing's syndrome, you'll likely have other tests to determine the location of the tumor first before deciding on your treatment. Surgery to remove the tumor may be best. If not, your doctor may be able to shrink the tumor with radiation or medicine. Eating well is an important part of living with Cushing's. A healthy diet can ease some symptoms and prevent others. Protect your bones by eating foods with calcium and vitamin D. Limit how much sodium and fatty foods you eat. A nutritionist can help you make sure you're getting enough of the right nutrients. Let your family and friends know what you're going through. Ask for their support, and let them know how they can help. Take time for the people and activities you enjoy. It's OK to say no and set limits, so you keep your energy up. If you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to a counselor or therapist. Your doctor may be able to give you a referral. Your symptoms and how long they'll last depend on: The amount of extra cortisol you have The cause of your high cortisol How long you've had the condition Your overall health Most of the time Cushing's syndrome can be treated and cured. If your Cushing's syndrome isn't curable, you'll want to look for ways to manage your weight gain, muscle weakness, and tiredness. Partner with your doctor on that, and tell your doctor how you're feeling. If you get depressed, it's important to get treated for that. Look for ways to connect online and in person with people who have experience with Cushing's syndrome. You can learn more about living with the condition, and meet other people who have it, in forums on the Cushing's Support & Research Foundation web site.\n",

It's called varicella zoster. It can lie quietly in your nerves for decades after causing chickenpox but suddenly wake up and become active. The main symptom of shingles is a painful rash that comes up on one side of your body or face. See your doctor as soon as you can if you think you might have this condition. Your doctor may want to put you on medications to control your infection and speed up healing, cut inflammation, and ease your pain. They include: These medicines may slow down the progress of the shingles rash, especially if you take them within the first 72 hours of having symptoms. They can also lower your chance of having complications. Your doctor may prescribe: Acyclovir ( Zovirax) Famciclovir ( Famvir) Valacyclovir ( Valtrex) Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about side effects to watch for if you're put on one these. Shingles causes inflammation and pain. Your doctor can suggest over-the-counter medicines to relieve milder discomfort. They include: Acetaminophen Ibuprofen Naproxen These may also help you stave off postherpetic neuralgia, which is a burning pain that some people get after the rash and blisters of shingles go away. If you have severe pain after the rash clears or an infection during your shingles outbreak, your doctor might prescribe: Capsaicin cream: Be careful not to get it in your eyes. A numbing medicine: You might get lidocaine ( Lidoderm, Xylocaine) for pain. It can come in a variety of forms, such as creams, lotions, patches, powders, and sprays, among others. Antibiotics : You might need these medicines if bacteria infect your skin and rashes. But if bacteria aren't involved, then antibiotics won't help. Tricyclic antidepressants : There are many of these medications that might help ease the pain that lingers after your skin has healed, such as amitriptyline, desipramine ( Norpramin), and nortriptyline ( Aventyl, Pamelor). They may also help you with depression, if you have that in addition to shingles. Your doctor can tell you what the risks and benefits are. There aren't home remedies for shingles. But there are things you can do to help your skin heal. Keep the affected area clean, dry, and exposed to air as much as possible. The itching can be maddening at times, but try not to scratch or burst the blisters. Ask your doctor about creams and other things you can try to give yourself some relief. Some people find that acupuncture and other complementary treatments help with the pain that can linger after shingles. Let your doctor know first if you want to try these. There are two shingles vaccines. Shingrix ( RZV) is recommended over the older vaccine, Zostavax, because it is more than 90% effective in preventing a shingles outbreak Who should get it: The CDC recommends that you get this vaccine if you're 50 or older whether or not you remember having had chickenpox, because most people have been exposed to the virus. If you have had the Zostavax vaccine, you can also have Shingrix. How many shots do you need? You would need two shots for Shingrix. One initially, with a follow up in 6 months. What it does: Shingrix reduces your chance of getting shingles by more than 90%. Even if you still get shingles, the vaccine may help it be less painful. I never had chickenpox. Do I still need the shingles vaccine? Yes, you do. Shingrix is recommended for everyone age 50 and older, whether or not you remember having had chickenpox. If I've had shingles, can I still get the vaccine? Yes. It may help prevent you having another bout of shingles later on. If you have shingles right now, you should wait until the rash is gone before you get vaccinated. What are the side effects? The most common side effects with Shingrix include pain and swelling where you got the shot, muscle pain, tiredness, headache, chills, fever, and stomach troubles. With any vaccine there is a chance of a severe allergic reaction. Also since Zostavax is a live virus vaccine, it is also possible to get a small chicken-pox like rash around the spot where you got the shot. Don't get the Shingrix vaccine if: You're allergic to any of the ingredients. You have a weak immune system, either because of a condition or due to certain medicines. You're pregnant or nursing. You have tested negative for immunity to the chicken pox virus. Ask your doctor about the chicken pox vaccine instead. You have shingles now. Also, besides the conditions stated above, do not get the Zostavax vaccine if you have a weakened immune or you may become pregnant within the next 4 weeks following the shot.\n",

      "Bone tumors grow when cells in the bone divide without control, forming a mass of tissue. Most bone tumors are benign, which means they are not cancer and do not spread to other areas of the body. But they may still weaken bone and lead to broken bones or cause other problems. Bone cancer destroys normal bone tissue. It may start in the bone or spread from other parts of the body (called metastasis). Benign tumors are more common than tumors caused by cancer. These are a few common types of benign bone tumors: Osteochondroma is the most common benign bone tumor. It is more common in people under age 20. Giant cell tumor is a benign tumor, typically in the leg (malignant types of this tumor are uncommon). Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor, often found in long bones, that happens commonly in the early 20s. Osteoblastoma is a rare, benign tumor that grows in the spine and long bones, mostly in young adults. Enchondroma usually appears in bones of the hands and feet. It often has no symptoms. It is the most common type of hand tumor. Cancer that's in your bones has most often come from cancer elsewhere in your body. For example, if lung cancer has spread to your bones, that's secondary bone cancer. Any cancer that moves from one part of the body to another is called metastatic cancer. Cancers that commonly spread to bone include: Breast cancer Prostate cancer Lung cancer Primary bone cancer, or bone sarcoma, is a cancerous tumor that starts in the bone. The cause is not certain, but heredity may play a role. Radiation therapy or cancer drugs may raise your chances of getting this type of cancer. As with all cancer, if primary bone cancer spreads to other places in your body, it's called metastatic cancer. These are some of the most common types of primary bone cancer: Osteosarcoma is most common around the knee and upper arm. Most of the time, it is found in teens and young adults. There is an adult form of this tumor that is usually seen in people with Paget's disease of bone. Ewing's sarcoma also is seen in younger people between the ages of 5 and 20. The ribs, pelvis, leg, and upper arm are the most common sites. It usually shows up in bone, but it can also start in soft tissue around bones. Chondrosarcoma happens most often in people between 40 and 70. The hip, pelvis, leg, arm, and shoulder are common sites of this cancer, which begins in cartilage cells. Although almost always found in bone, multiple myelomais not a primary bone cancer. It is a bone marrow cancer. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones. You may have no symptoms of a bone tumor, whether it's cancer or not. This is common. Your doctor may find a tumor when looking at an X-ray of another problem, such as a sprain. But symptoms may include pain that: Is in the area of the tumor Is dull or achy May get worse with activity Wakes you at night Trauma does not cause a bone tumor, but a bone that is weakened by a tumor may break more easily. This can cause severe pain. Other symptoms related to bone tumors may include: Fevers Night sweats Swelling around a bone Limping If you think you might have a bone tumor, see your doctor right way. Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history and do a physical exam. You may need blood and imaging tests. To confirm a diagnosis, your doctor may remove tissue with a needle or through a cut and have it examined under a microscope for signs of cancer. This is called a biopsy. Cancerous bone tumors need more aggressive treatment. Benign tumors are watched or may be treated with medication. Your doctor may remove benign tumors that are more likely to spread or become cancer. In some cases, tumors come back, even after treatment. Tumors caused by bone cancer, whether primary or metastatic, may need the attention of several cancer specialists. Treatment depends on how far it has spread, called its stage. Cancer cells confined to the bone tumor and surrounding area are at a localized stage. Bone cancers that spread to or from other areas of the body are more serious and a cure is more difficult. Cancers of the bone are most often removed with surgery. These are the common types of treatment for bone cancer: Limb salvage surgery removes the part of the bone with cancer. Nearby muscles, tendons, and other tissues are not removed. A metallic implant replaces the portion of bone that was removed. Amputation may be done if a tumor is large or extends to nerves and blood vessels. You may get a prosthetic limb after amputation. Radiation therapy kills cancer cells and shrinks tumors with high-dose X-rays. It is often used in combination with surgery and may be used before or after surgery. Chemotherapy kills tumor cells with cancer drugs. Chemotherapy may be given before surgery, after surgery, or for metastatic disease. Your doctor may recommend that you join a clinical trial. They test new treatments. Regardless of your type of treatment, you will need regular follow-up visits with your doctor.\n",

      "Cora, a miller's daughter, earns extra money from working in a tavern. After chastely declining the flirtatious advances of patrons, she accidentally falls into Jonathan's lap. He, who has been coming to the pub for a week, offers her a seat since she has been working past the end of her shift. Jonathan compliments her for behaving with the grace of a lady, to which Cora talks about doing so due to her wish to be better than what she is. He mentions having to depart soon, and drops a handkerchief, which is embroidered with the royal crest. Citing that he had hoped for her to know him as a normal man rather than a prince, Jonathan proposes to her with a straw ring and promises, in two weeks' time, to return with a gold ring. Prior to his leaving, they consummate the marriage. After two weeks, Cora doesn't hear from Jonathan and finds him, two months later, at the royal estate, where she learns he is not a prince, but a gardener. When Cora admits being pregnant, she asks him to provide her with money for herself and the child to get by, and if not, she will tell the actual prince what he did to her. Jonathan doesn't care, so she calls for help, but he knocks her away and flees. She is found by Prince Leopold and later shows him how to build a campfire. As they bond, he tells her about his engagement to a princess, Eva, but decides to marry Cora instead. Two days before the wedding, Jonathan threatens to reveal their past and her pregnancy unless she provides him with riches. Before she can fulfill the deal, Eva, having overheard the conversation, exposes the truth to Leopold. With her lie exposed, Cora is hauled away by guards, and she gives birth to her child. Unable to give up on her dream to be more than a miller's daughter, Cora abandons her daughter to a passing cyclone, which whisks the infant to another world.

He was created by Dick Wolf and Michael S. Chernuchin and has been portrayed by Sam Waterston during the show's original run from 1994 to 2010 and again from 2022 until his retirement in 2024. He is the longest-tenured character on the show, appearing in 19 seasons. He has appeared in 405 episodes of Law & Order, four episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, two episodes of Law & Order: Trial by Jury, two episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street, and the made-for-TV movie Exiled.[citation needed] Waterston's performance as McCoy on the New York–based series was so popular that it resulted in him being declared a 'Living Landmark' by the New York Landmarks Conservancy, along with fellow longtime series cast member Jerry Orbach (who portrayed the popular police detective Lennie Briscoe for almost 12 years). Character overview McCoy is introduced as Executive Assistant District Attorney by Adam Schiff (Steven Hill) in the season five premiere episode 'Second Opinion'. He has been nicknamed 'Hang 'em High McCoy'. He describes himself as a 'junkyard dog'. He is well-respected in the legal community, once referred to as 'the top of the legal food chain' by a rival attorney during a trial. Following the 17th season (2006–2007), McCoy is appointed interim district attorney, taking over from Arthur Branch (Fred Thompson). McCoy's appearance on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit on the November 13, 2007, episode 'Blinded', marked his first appearance in the Law & Order universe as district attorney. Law & Order originally ceased production in 2010, but McCoy (though not seen) was still occasionally mentioned as being the Manhattan DA in the spin-off series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in several episodes through 2011. A reference to 'the new DA' in a 2013 SVU episode would indicate that McCoy had moved on from the position presumably sometime in 2012; his replacement was unnamed. However, McCoy was the DA again as of 2018, showing up in the SVU episode 'The Undiscovered Country'. In 2022, he appeared as the DA in the revival of the original Law & Order, with ADAs Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy) and Samantha Maroun (Odelya Halevi) working under him. \n",

Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 brought many countries into the war. This event, and the declaration of war by France and Britain two days later, mark the beginning of World War II. After the declaration of war, Western Europe saw minimal land and air warfare, leading to this time period being termed the 'Phoney War'. At sea, this time period saw the opening stages of the Battle of the Atlantic. In eastern Europe, however, the agreement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed on 23 August opened the way in September for the Soviet Union's invasion of eastern Poland, which was divided between the two countries before the end of the month.

In some instances, only a small portion of the total manufacturing costs are attributable to foreign processing, but that processing represents a significant amount of the product’s overall processing. The same could be true for some foreign parts. In these cases, the foreign content (processing or parts) is more than negligible, and, as a result, unqualified claims are inappropriate. \n",
      "Example: A company manufactures food processors in its U.S. plant, making most of the parts, including the housing and blade, from U.S. materials. The motor, which constitutes 50 percent of the food processor’s total manufacturing costs, is bought from a U.S. supplier. The food processor manufacturer knows that the motor is assembled in a U.S. factory. Even though most of the parts of the food processor are of U.S. origin, the final assembly is in the U.S., and the motor is assembled in the U.S., the food processor is not considered 'all or virtually all' American-made if the motor itself is made of imported parts that constitute a significant percentage of the appliance’s total manufacturing cost. Before claiming the product is Made in USA, this manufacturer should look to its motor supplier for more specific information about the motor’s origin. \n",

      "where did the violin get its name from\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 'violin' comes from \u001b[92m\"Italian violino, [a] diminutive of viola\" [1]\u001b[0m. The term 'viola' itself originates from \u001b[92m\"Medieval Latin vitula as a term which means 'stringed instrument', perhaps [coming] from Vitula, Roman goddess of joy\" [2]\u001b[0m..., or from related Latin verb vitulari, 'to cry out in joy or exaltation.'\n",
      "Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it. Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed. Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial 'trade violins' coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker. Etymology The word 'violin' was first used in English in the 1570s. The word 'violin' comes from 'Italian violino, [a] diminutive of viola. The term 'viola' comes from the expression for 'tenor violin' in 1797, from Italian and Old Provençal viola, [which came from] Medieval Latin vitula as a term which means 'stringed instrument', perhaps [coming] from Vitula, Roman goddess of joy..., or from related Latin verb vitulari, 'to cry out in joy or exaltation.' The related term Viola da gamba meaning 'bass viol' (1724) is from Italian, literally 'a viola for the leg' (i.e. to hold between the legs).' A violin is the 'modern form of the smaller, medieval viola da braccio.' ('arm viola') \n",

In his biography of Orwell, George Orwell: A Life, Bernard Crick cast doubt on the idea that Orwell himself actually shot an elephant.

      "The women's singles competition in figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 15 February (short program) and 17 February (free skating), at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Haidian District of Beijing. Anna Shcherbakova, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, won the event, and her teammate, Alexandra Trusova, the silver medal. Kaori Sakamoto of Japan won bronze. For all, it was their first individual Olympic medals; Sakamoto had earlier won a medal in the team event. Event summary \n",
      "The results of the 2022 team event were fraught with controversy. The medal ceremony originally scheduled for February 8 was delayed over what International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required 'legal consultation' with the International Skating Union. Several media outlets reported that the issue was over a positive test from December 2021 that showed the presence of trimetazidine in a sample given by Kamila Valieva from the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), which was officially confirmed on February 11. The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), under suspension from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2015 for its years of serving solely to hide the positive doping results of Russian athletes, cleared Valieva on February 9, a day after the December test results were released and two months after the test. The IOC, WADA, and the ISU appealed the RUSADA's decision. On February 14, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that Valieva be allowed to compete in the women's single event, stating that preventing her from competing 'would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances', although her gold medal in the team event was still under consideration. The favorable decision from the court was made in part due to her age, as minor athletes are subject to different rules than adult athletes. The IOC announced that the medal ceremony would not take place until the investigation was over and there was a concrete decision whether to strip Russia of their medals. On 29 January 2024, the CAS disqualified Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation which they found her to have committed. On 30 January 2024, the ISU, among other actions, re-allocated the medals in the figure skating team event, upgrading the United States and Japan to gold and silver while downgrading the ROC to bronze.

At nighttime, Edd wears a yellow onesie and his ever-present hat. Season 5 shows him sleeping with a light blue and white nightcap instead. Edd has three black hairs that stick out of his hat in a similar style to Eddy's, but facing downwards instead of upwards. His two most notable physical features are his big chin (said to be similar to Kevin's), and the gap between his teeth. In the first season, his skin was light yellow, but it progressively became more desert sand-beige. His eye color was shown to be blue-green on the front cover of Ed, Edd n Eddy - The Mis-Edventures. His tongue is a mint-green color. Two frames in 'Fool on the Ed' reveals Edd's eye color to be a light green in the first instance and a very light gold color in the second instance. In the later seasons, Edd wears a yellow tie over his shirt when attending school. When going outside, he wears a brown cardigan with olive drab trimmings. When it is snowing, he wears an orange snow jacket, light green scarf, earmuffs, and purple snow pants with a white stripe on both sides. Personality[] \n",

      "Major federal programs and agencies, including the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Civil Works Administration (CWA), the Farm Security Administration (FSA), the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA) and the Social Security Administration (SSA), provided support for farmers, the unemployed, youth, and the elderly. The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply. New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. \n",
      "The New Deal policies drew from many different ideas proposed earlier in the 20th century. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold led efforts that hearkened back to an anti-monopoly tradition rooted in American politics by figures such as Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, an influential adviser to many New Dealers, argued that 'bigness' (referring, presumably, to corporations) was a negative economic force, producing waste and inefficiency. However, the anti-monopoly group never had a major impact on New Deal policy. Other leaders such as Hugh S. Johnson of the NRA took ideas from the Woodrow Wilson Administration, advocating techniques used to mobilize the economy for World War I. They brought ideas and experience from the government controls and spending of 1917–1918. Other New Deal planners revived experiments suggested in the 1920s, such as the TVA. The 'First New Deal' (1933–1934) encompassed the proposals offered by a wide spectrum of groups (not included was the Socialist Party, whose influence was all but destroyed). This first phase of the New Deal was also characterized by fiscal conservatism (see Economy Act, below) and experimentation with several different, sometimes contradictory, cures for economic ills. \n",
      "On June 16, 1933, this act established the National Recovery Administration, which supervised fair trade codes and guaranteed laborers a right to collective bargaining. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was enacted by Congress in June 1933 and was one of the measures by which President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to assist the nation's economic recovery during the Great Depression. The passage of NIRA ushered in a unique experiment in U.S. economic history – the NIRA sanctioned, supported, and in some cases, enforced an alliance of industries. Antitrust laws were suspended, and companies were required to write industry-wide 'codes of fair competition' that effectively fixed prices and wages, established production quotas, and imposed restrictions on entry of other companies into the alliances. \n",

Roosevelt’s successor, President William Howard Taft, had the Oval Office constructed within an enlarged office wing. Less than fifty years after the Roosevelt renovation, the White House was already showing signs of serious structural weakness. President Harry S.

It was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was structurally completed by 1436, with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi. The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink, bordered by white, and has an elaborate 19th-century Gothic Revival façade by Emilio De Fabris. \n",
      "After Arnolfo died in 1302, work on the cathedral slowed for almost 50 years. When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata, the project gained a new impetus. In 1331, the Arte della Lana, the guild of wool merchants, took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work. Assisted by Andrea Pisano, Giotto continued di Cambio's design. His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile. When Giotto died on 8 January 1337, Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348.

      "The ceiling of the dome is decorated with a representation of The Last Judgment. Originally left whitewashed following its completion it was the Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici who decided to have the ceiling of the dome painted. This enormous work, 3,600 metres² (38 750 ft²) of painted surface, was started in 1572 by Giorgio Vasari and would not be completed until 1579. The upper portion, near the lantern, representing The 24 Elders of Apocalypse was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574. Federico Zuccari with the assistance of Bartolomeo Carducci, Domenico Passignano and Stefano Pieri finished the other portions: (from top to bottom) Choirs of Angels; Christ, Mary and Saints; Virtues, Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes; and at the bottom of the cupola: Capital Sins and Hell. These frescoes are considered Zuccari's greatest work. But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques. Vasari had used true fresco, while Zuccari had painted in secco. During the restoration work, which ended in 1995, the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue. All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system. \n",

      "who said the poison is in the dose\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[92m\"It is credited to Paracelsus who expressed the classic toxicology maxim 'All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison.'\" [1]\u001b[0m\n",
      "Alle Dinge sind Gift, und nichts ist ohne Gift; allein die Dosis macht, dass ein Ding kein Gift ist.All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison. —Paracelsus, 1538 'The dose makes the poison' (Latin: dosis sola facit venenum 'only the dose makes the poison') is an adage intended to indicate a basic principle of toxicology. It is credited to Paracelsus who expressed the classic toxicology maxim 'All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison.' This is often condensed to: 'The dose makes the poison' or in Latin, 'Sola dosis facit venenum'. It means that a substance can produce the harmful effect associated with its toxic properties only if it reaches a susceptible biological system within the body in a high enough concentration (i.e., dose). \n",
      "How effective was this concoction? According to the legend, very. When Mithridates was defeated by the Roman general Pompey, he tried to commit suicide by taking poison. It didn’t work! Why? Because the king had become immune to poisons, destined to die by the sword of his foes. With the passing of years, the legend of Mithridates grew, as did the number of ingredients in the 'antidote.' Celsus, the Roman physician, recommended a mithridatum with thirty-six ingredients including acacia juice, rhubarb root, saffron and ginger. Pliny the Elder described a version that had fifty-four ingredients, and Emperor Nero’s physician, Andromachus, improved on this by adding another ten, including viper flesh, believing that there must be something in it that protected the snake from its own venom. \n",
      "The principle that the dose makes the poison is paramount. It means that all chemicals, from whatever source – human manufacture or natural – are potentially toxic at some dose. This fundamental concept underlies toxicology and is crucial to the assessment of risk from chemicals and their safe use. It is known as the dose-response relationship – it is the amount of the substance that causes it to be toxic, not the substance itself. Dose-response relationship Some years ago, a death occurred due to the overconsumption of carrots. People have died from drinking too much water (water intoxication). Too much oxygen (vital for life) results in cell damage and can lead to death (oxygen toxicity). Likewise, even for extremely toxic substances such as snake venom, there is a dose below which there is no detectable toxic effect. The dose-response relationship is fundamental in determining safe concentrations. The dose is the total amount of a substance administered to, taken or absorbed by an organism. \n",

      "A major depressive episode may occur just once in a person's life or may return repeatedly. People who have many episodes of major depression may also have periods of persistent but milder depressed mood. During a major depressive episode, thinking can get out of step with reality. The person has 'psychotic symptoms' such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations). Some people who have episodes of major depression also have episodes of relatively high energy or irritability. They may sleep far less than normal, and may dream up grand plans that could never be carried out. The severe form of this is called 'mania' or a manic episode. Psychotic symptoms also occur in mania. If a person has milder symptoms of mania and does not lose touch with reality, it is called 'hypomania' or a hypomanic episode. \n",

      "Its association with France dates back from the Middle Ages and is due to the play on words in Latin between Gallus, meaning an inhabitant of Gaul, and gallus, meaning rooster, or cockerel. Its use, by the enemies of France, dates to this period, originally a pun to make fun of the French, the association between the rooster and the Gauls/French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents: prior to being arrested, Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning. At the rooster's crowing, Peter remembered Jesus's words. Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil. It is also an emblem of the Christian's attitude of watchfulness and readiness for the sudden return of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment of humankind. That is why, during the Renaissance, the rooster became a symbol of France as a Catholic state and became a popular Christian image on weather vanes, also known as weathercocks.[citation needed] Gallic rooster atop a World War I memorial, Liomer (Somme). The popularity of the Gallic rooster as a national personification faded away until its resurgence during the French Revolution (1789). The republican historiography completely modified the traditional perception of the origins of France. Until then, the royal historiography dated the origins of France back to the baptism of Clovis I in 496, the 'first Christian king of France'. The republicans rejected this royalist and Christian origin of the country and trace the origins of France back to the ancient Gaul. Although purely apocryphal, the rooster became the personification of the early inhabitants of France, the Gauls. The Gallic rooster, colloquially named Chantecler, had been a national emblem ever since, especially during the Third Republic. The rooster was featured on the reverse of French 20-franc gold pieces from 1899 to 1914. After World War I it was depicted on countless war memorials. \n",

      "Antigone was addressed by the fifth-century BC Greek playwright Sophocles. \u001b[92m\"In Sophocles The story of Antigone was addressed by the fifth-century BC Greek playwright Sophocles in his Theban plays\" [1]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "In Greek mythology, Antigone (/ænˈtɪɡəni/ ann-TIG-ə-nee; Ancient Greek: Ἀντιγόνη, romanized: Antigónē) is a Theban princess and a character in several ancient Greek tragedies. She is the daughter of Oedipus, king of Thebes; her mother is either Jocasta or, in another variation of the myth, Euryganeia. She is a sister of Polynices, Eteocles, and Ismene. The meaning of the name is, as in the case of the masculine equivalent Antigonus, 'in place of one's parents' or 'worthy of one's parents'. Antigone appears in the three 5th century BC tragic plays written by Sophocles, known collectively as the three Theban plays, being the protagonist of the eponymous tragedy Antigone. She makes a brief appearance at the end of Aeschylus' Seven against Thebes, while her story was also the subject of Euripides' now lost play with the same name. In Sophocles The story of Antigone was addressed by the fifth-century BC Greek playwright Sophocles in his Theban plays: Oedipus Rex Main article: Oedipus Rex \n",
      "Antigone is brought before Creon, and admits that she knew of Creon's law forbidding mourning for Polynices but chose to break it, claiming the superiority of divine over human law, and she defies Creon's cruelty with courage, passion, and determination. Creon orders Antigone buried alive in a tomb. Although Creon has a change of heart, due to a visit from soothsayer Tiresias, and tries to release Antigone, he finds she has hanged herself. Creon's son Haemon, who was engaged to Antigone, commits suicide with a knife, and his mother Queen Eurydice also kills herself in despair over her son's death. She had been forced to weave throughout the entire story, and her death alludes to The Fates. By her death Antigone ends up destroying the household of her adversary, Creon. Other representations In the oldest version of the story, the burial of Polynices takes place during Oedipus' reign in Thebes, before Oedipus marries his mother, Jocasta. However, in other versions such as Sophocles' tragedies Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, it occurs in the years after the banishment and death of Oedipus and Antigone's struggles against Creon.[citation needed] Seven Against Thebes Antigone appears briefly in Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes.[citation needed] Euripides's Lost Play The dramatist Euripides also wrote a play called Antigone, which is lost, but some of the text was preserved by later writers and in passages in his Phoenissae. In Euripides, the calamity is averted by the intercession of Dionysus and is followed by the marriage of Antigone and Hæmon. Antigone also plays a role in the Phoenissae.[citation needed] Appearances Elsewhere \n",

      "In 1977, Waldron was approached by Warner Bros. with the idea of developing Moonrunners into a television series. Waldron reworked various elements from Moonrunners, ultimately devising what became The Dukes of Hazzard. Production began in October 1978 with the original intention of only nine episodes for a mid-season filler. The first five episodes were filmed in Covington and Conyers, Georgia and surrounding areas, including some location work in nearby Atlanta. After completing production on the fifth episode, 'High Octane', the cast and crew broke for Christmas break, expecting to return in several weeks to complete the ordered run of episodes. In the meantime, executives at Warner Bros. were impressed by the rough preview cuts of the completed episodes and saw potential in developing the show into a full-running series. Part of this plan was to move production from Georgia to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, to simplify production as well as develop a larger workshop to service the large number of automobiles needed for the series. \n",
      "As well as car chases, jumps and stunts, The Dukes of Hazzard relied on character familiarity, with each character effectively serving the same role within a typical episode. Deputy Cletus replaced Deputy Enos in Seasons 3 and 4, and Coy and Vance Duke temporarily replaced Bo and Luke (due to a salary dispute) for most of Season 5, but these were the only major cast changes through the show's run. Only Uncle Jesse and Boss Hogg appeared in all 145 episodes; Daisy appears in all but one, the third season's 'To Catch a Duke.' The General Lee also appears in all episodes except 'Mary Kaye's Baby'. The show was largely filmed in Hidden Valley in Thousand Oaks, California, with scenes also shot at nearby Lake Sherwood and also at Paramount Ranch in nearby Agoura Hills.

      "The university scene in the movie Dukes of Hazzard features a high-speed car chase in Luke and Bo's iconic 1969 Dodge Charger stock car through Louisiana University. The sequence is iconic and is an excellent example of the action-packed adventures that the Duke boys often find themselves on. It was filmed on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Louisiana State University has a rich history dating back to 1920, exemplified by its unique Spanish-Mexican design crafted by the renowned Olmsted firm. Highland Road and Dalrymple Drive were chosen for filming purposes due to their awe-inspiring features, such as stucco walls and red-tiled roofs with porticoes reminiscent of Andrea Palladio's timeless architecture.Visitors can fly to Louisiana State University into Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport (BTR). From there, it is about 15 minutes to drive to the university by car. If you're taking public transportation, there are several bus lines that run throughout Baton Rouge that will take you close to the campus as well. \n",

      "Each year, before a joint session of Congress, the president fulfills his or her constitutional duty to 'give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union' (Article II, section 3). Presidents George Washington and John Adams delivered their messages in person, but in 1801 Thomas Jefferson chose to send his in writing. That precedent held until Woodrow Wilson decided to deliver his message in person in 1913, a tradition that continues today. Franklin Roosevelt referred to it as the 'State of the Union Address,' a title that became official during the Harry Truman administration. The first national radio broadcast of the message occurred in 1923, following a limited but successful experimentation with radio in 1922. Truman's 1947 address was the first to be televised, and in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson began the tradition of delivering the address in prime time. In 1966 the opposition party began offering a televised response to the president's speech, a tradition that has continued.

      "In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times. \n",
      "Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million. After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by 'mutual agreement'. On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as 'La Décima' (Spanish: 'The Tenth,' [la ˈðeθima]). Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals. After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, 'If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, 'We must start again from zero.' After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season. In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals. Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012. Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals, several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015. Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as 'La Duodécima'. The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season. Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season. On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy. In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's 'need for change' as his rationale for departing. Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history, and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage. Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners. \n",
      "Real Madrid has had the most success in the European Cup, winning the trophy for a record fifteen times. Real was the winner of the inaugural edition of the tournament and remains the only club to win the trophy five times in a row (the first five editions). It also holds the distinction of being the only club to defend the title in the Champions League era, as well as to win it three times in a row. The club has also won the UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986, the Super Cup five times, in 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2022, the Intercontinental Cup three times, in 1960, 1998, and 2002, and the FIFA Club World Cup five times, in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022. Real Madrid, with 30 continental and worldwide trophies, is the most successful team in international club football. Latin Cup \n",

      "The Games featured a record 109 events across 15 disciplines, with big air freestyle skiing and women's monobob making their Olympic debuts as medal events, as well as several new mixed competitions. A total of 2,871 athletes representing 91 teams competed in the Games, with Haiti and Saudi Arabia making their Winter Olympic debut. Beijing's hosting of the Games was subject to various concerns and controversies including those related to human rights violations in China, such as the persecution of Uyghurs in China, which led to calls for a boycott of the games. Like the Summer Olympics held six months earlier in Tokyo, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of health and safety protocols, and, for the second Games in a row, the Games being closed to the public (with selected events open to invited guests at a reduced capacity). \n",
      "On 17 January 2022, amid increasing lockdowns across China and the first detected case of the Omicron variant in Beijing, it was announced that ticket sales to the general public were cancelled, and that limited numbers of spectators would be admitted by invitation only. These, therefore, became the second Olympics in a row that were closed to the general public. In the lead-up to the Games, organizers stated that they had aimed for at least 30% capacity at each venue, divided equally between spectators from within the 'closed loop' (including dignitaries, delegations, and the press), and invited guests from outside of it (including local residents, school students, winter sports enthusiasts, and marketing partners). At least 150,000 spectators from outside the 'closed loop' were expected to attend. Spectators were only present at events held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou; all events in Yanqing were held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. \n",
      "Key event timeline In October 2018, American senator Marco Rubio, Senator Jeff Merkley, and Congressmen Jim McGovern and Chris Smith sent a letter, on behalf of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requesting the revocation of China's host right on the 2022 Winter Olympics. The letter stated that 'no Olympics should be held in a country whose government is committing genocide and crimes against humanity.' In November 2021, President Biden proposed 'a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.' The United States was aware of the prospective harsh punishment of being suspended by the National Olympic Committee and was careful regarding the scale and severity of the boycott. \n",
      "The Olympic Games are a mega-event that is held every four years and draws millions of viewers around the world; at the Rio Olympic Games for instance, 7.5 million tickets were sold, and local fans had to enter a drawing to be qualified for tickets (Xinhua, 2015). Besides, the 2012 London Olympic Games attracted over 900,000 additional tickets over previous Games in popular sports (Flint, 2012). The interests in bidding and holding the Olympics are growing among the most populated and prominent cities (Dansero & Puttilli, 2010). This article mainly analyzes what the future of Chinese winter sports will be, and what would be the future impacts on tourism, the regional economy and sports marketing practices on China and Beijing in becoming the host of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing will become the first city that hosts both the Summer and Winter Olympics in sports history despite there being several countries that have already hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics (i.e. United States, France, Italy, Canada, Germany and Japan). Although most winter sports have not been overly popular in China, skiing is a different story, the number of participants in skiing in China were 12.5 million person-times, and the growth margin was 21.36% compared to 2013-2014 and 98.41% in 2009-2010 respectively (You, 2016). According to You, the core participants of winter sports in China are only 1 million, and most of those participants are experiencing winter sports or participating because of the local environment.

      "The Beijing Winter Olympics open in a month and the FIFA World Cup kicks off in November in Qatar. With the world’s two biggest sporting events being hosted by major human rights abusers, this year is forcing an overdue reckoning for powerful sports bodies that for years have sidelined their formal commitments to human rights. The Olympics and the World Cup each have audiences of more than 3 billion people worldwide — almost half the global population — which is why China and Qatar so badly want to refashion their images as glamorous sporting hosts in good standing in the world. And why they are effectively 'sportswashing' their abysmal human rights records. \n",
      "The IOC failed to punish Chinese leaders for breaking their empty Olympic promises — and in 2015 awarded Beijing the 2022 Winter Games. Since then, President Xi Jinping’s government has arrested journalists, women’s rights activists and lawyers; dismantled freedoms in Hong Kong; and committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, including mass detentions, torture, sexual abuse and cultural persecution of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. Crimes against humanity are among the gravest human rights abuses under international law, making the Chinese government the wrong host for an event the IOC claims will 'celebrate humanity.' The IOC has uttered not a word about these abuses. \n",

Unfortunately, this historic Games was marked by tragedy when a terrorist bomb exploded in the Centennial Olympic Park, killing two people and injuring 110 more. 2002 Winter Olympics: Salt Lake City, Utah The most recent Olympics to be held in the United States was in 2002 when Salt Lake City, Utah, hosted the Winter Games. The Salt Lake City Olympics was a historic one for the Black community.

A small, but enthusiastic, group of spectators sat in the stands at Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium during the bitterly cold night in the host city.

      "Cartilaginous joints are those in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints: synchondroses and symphyses. In a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. In symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone, but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae and between the pubic bones. Amphiarthroses allow only slight movement; therefore, either type of cartilaginous joint is an amphiarthrosis. Synovial Joints Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones. This space, referred to as the synovial (or joint) cavity, is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage. The entire joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue. This allows movement of the joint as well as resistance to dislocation. Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint. Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints. Since they allow for free movement, synovial joints are classified as diarthroses. \n",
      "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Slightly movable joint Cartilaginous jointCartilaginous jointsDetailsIdentifiersLatinjunctura cartilagineaTA98A03.0.00.015TA21528FMA7496Anatomical terminology[edit on Wikidata] Cartilaginous joints are connected entirely by cartilage (fibrocartilage or hyaline). Cartilaginous joints allow more movement between bones than a fibrous joint but less than the highly mobile synovial joint. Cartilaginous joints also forms the growth regions of immature long bones and the intervertebral discs of the spinal column. Primary cartilaginous joints Primary cartilaginous joints are known as 'synchondrosis'. These bones are connected by hyaline cartilage and sometimes occur between ossification centers. This cartilage may ossify with age. Some examples of primary cartilaginous joints in humans are the 'growth plates' between ossification centers in long bones. These joints allow very little movement, such as in the spine or ribs. Secondary cartilaginous joints Secondary cartilaginous joints are known as 'symphysis'. These include fibrocartilaginous and hyaline joints, which usually occur at the midline. Some examples of secondary cartilaginous joints in human anatomy would be the manubriosternal joint (between the manubrium and the body of the sternum), intervertebral discs, and the pubic symphysis. Articulating bones at a symphysis are covered with hyaline cartilage and have a thick, fairly compressible pad of fibrocartilage between them. Cartilaginous joints allow little movement, as summarized above. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the manubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum. \n",
      "Figure 9.4.3 – Types of Synovial Joints: The six types of synovial joints allow the body to move in a variety of ways. (a) Pivot joints allow for rotation around an axis, such as between the first and second cervical vertebrae, which allows for side-to-side rotation of the head. (b) The hinge joint of the elbow works like a door hinge. (c) The articulation between the trapezium carpal bone and the first metacarpal bone at the base of the thumb is a saddle joint. (d) Plane joints, such as those between the tarsal bones of the foot, allow for limited gliding movements between bones. (e) The radiocarpal joint of the wrist is a condyloid joint. (f) The hip and shoulder joints are the only ball-and-socket joints of the body. Pivot Joint \n",
      "Ball-and-Socket Joint The joint with the greatest range of motion is the ball-and-socket joint. At these joints, the rounded head of one bone (the ball) fits into the concave articulation (the socket) of the adjacent bone (see Figure 9.4.3f). The hip joint and the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint are the only ball-and-socket joints of the body. At the hip joint, the head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone, and at the shoulder joint, the head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. \n",
      "Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints: synchondroses and symphyses. In a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. In symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae. Either type of cartilaginous joint allows for very little movement. Synovial Joints \n",
      "A cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage is called a symphysis ('growing together'). Fibrocartilage is very strong because it contains numerous bundles of thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much greater ability to resist pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage. This gives symphyses the ability to strongly unite the adjacent bones, but can still allow for limited movement to occur. Thus, a symphysis is functionally classified as an amphiarthrosis. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the manubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum. \n",
      "There are two types of cartilaginous joints. A synchondrosis is formed when the adjacent bones are united by hyaline cartilage. A temporary synchondrosis is formed by the epiphyseal plate of a growing long bone, which is lost when the epiphyseal plate ossifies as the bone reaches maturity. The synchondrosis is thus replaced by a synostosis. Permanent synchondroses that do not ossify are found at the first sternocostal joint and between the anterior ends of the bony ribs and the junction with their costal cartilage. A symphysis is where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage and the gap between the bones may be narrow or wide. A narrow symphysis is found at the manubriosternal joint and at the pubic symphysis. A wide symphysis is the intervertebral symphysis in which the bodies of adjacent vertebrae are united by an intervertebral disc. Interactive Link Questions \n",

The epiphyseal plate of growing long bones and the first sternocostal joint that unites the first rib to the sternum are examples of synchondroses. At a symphysis, the bones are joined by fibrocartilage, which is strong and flexible. Symphysis joints include the intervertebral symphysis between adjacent vertebrae and the pubic symphysis that joins the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones. Both functional and structural classifications can be used to describe an individual joint. Define the first sternocostal joint and the pubic symphysis using both functional and structural characteristics. \n",

His power was confirmed by the new Constitution of 1799, which preserved the appearance of a republic but in reality established a dictatorship. Key Terms Thermidorian Reaction A 1794 coup d’état within the French Revolution against the leaders of the Jacobin Club that dominated the Committee of Public Safety. It was triggered by a vote of the National Convention to execute Maximilien Robespierre, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, and several other leaders of the revolutionary government. It ended the most radical phase of the French Revolution.

      "Napoleon’s rule became increasingly authoritarian. The constant wars between France and her neighbours weakened the Empire. In 1814 Napoleon abdicated, paving the way for the ascension of Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI, to the throne (see below); but he subsequently returned for a period known as the 'Hundred Days,' ruling from 1st March to 7 July 1815.

      "The French Revolution[a] was a period of political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789, and ended with the coup of 18 Brumaire in November 1799 and the formation of the French Consulate. Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy, while its values and institutions remain central to modern French political discourse. Its causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political, and economic factors, which the Ancien Régime proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and widespread social distress led in May 1789 to the convocation of the Estates General, which was converted into a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and a declaration of rights. The next three years were dominated by the struggle for political control, exacerbated by economic depression. Military defeats following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 resulted in the insurrection of 10 August 1792. The monarchy was abolished and replaced by the French First Republic in September, while Louis XVI was executed in January 1793. After another revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended and effective political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety. About 16,000 people were executed in a Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in 1795 by the Directory. Four years later in 1799, the Consulate seized power in a military coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte. This is generally seen as marking the end of the Revolutionary period. Causes Part of a series on the History of France \n",
      "Despite calls to replace the monarchy with a republic, Louis retained his position but was generally regarded with acute suspicion and forced to swear allegiance to the constitution. A new decree stated retracting this oath, making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would be considered abdication. However, radicals led by Jacques Pierre Brissot prepared a petition demanding his deposition, and on 17 July, an immense crowd gathered in the Champ de Mars to sign. Led by Lafayette, the National Guard was ordered to 'preserve public order' and responded to a barrage of stones by firing into the crowd, killing between 13 and 50 people. \n",
      "The Girondins hoped war would unite the people behind the government and provide an excuse for rising prices and food shortages, but found themselves the target of popular anger. Many left for the provinces. The first conscription measure or levée en masse on 24 February sparked riots in Paris and other regional centres. Already unsettled by changes imposed on the church, in March the traditionally conservative and royalist Vendée rose in revolt. On 18th, Dumouriez was defeated at Neerwinden and defected to the Austrians. Uprisings followed in Bordeaux, Lyon, Toulon, Marseilles and Caen. The Republic seemed on the verge of collapse. \n",
      "The Law of 22 Prairial (10 June) denied 'enemies of the people' the right to defend themselves. Those arrested in the provinces were now sent to Paris for judgement; from March to July, executions in Paris increased from five to twenty-six a day. Many Jacobins ridiculed the festival of the Cult of the Supreme Being on 8 June, a lavish and expensive ceremony led by Robespierre, who was also accused of circulating claims he was a second Messiah. Relaxation of price controls and rampant inflation caused increasing unrest among the sans-culottes, but the improved military situation reduced fears the Republic was in danger. Fearing their own survival depended on Robespierre's removal, on 29 June three members of the Committee of Public Safety openly accused him of being a dictator. The execution of Robespierre on 28 July 1794 marked the end of the Reign of Terror. \n",
      "The Revolution initiated a series of conflicts that began in 1792 and ended only with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815. In its early stages, this seemed unlikely; the 1791 Constitution specifically disavowed 'war for the purpose of conquest', and although traditional tensions between France and Austria re-emerged in the 1780s, Emperor Joseph II cautiously welcomed the reforms. Austria was at war with the Ottomans, as were the Russians, while both were negotiating with Prussia over partitioning Poland. Most importantly, Britain preferred peace, and as Emperor Leopold II stated after the Declaration of Pillnitz, 'without England, there is no case'. \n",
      "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite! The following summer, the National Assembly created a new constitution. While King Louis XVI remained the nominal head of state, the National Assembly held all legislative power. On June 20, 1791, Louis and his family, including his despised Austrian queen, Marie-Antoinette, attempted to flee France and were captured. The newly created Legislative Assembly wanted to spread the revolution across Europe. In April 1792, France declared war on Austria. The war went badly, and Louis XVI was blamed. Accused of treason, he was stripped of his title and imprisoned. In September 1792 a new National Convention declared France a republic and abolished the monarchy. On January 21, 1793, Louis XVI was marched to the guillotine. His severed head was paraded for the gathered thousands and met with cries of 'Vive la Republique!' Maximilien Robespierre, Courtesy: Library of Congress Madame Guillotine On September 5, 1793, Maximilien Robespierre began the Reign of Terror in response to the invasion of France by foreign troops. Thousands of so-called counterrevolutionaries were slaughtered; estimates range from 14,000 to 40,000. France remained in Robespierre's bloody grip for 10 months until he too was captured and beheaded. With the Reign of Terror over, France found some peace, but the country remained at war with Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Spain following Louis XVI's execution.

      "A Christmas card is a greeting card sent as part of the traditional celebration of Christmas in order to convey between people a range of sentiments related to Christmastide and the holiday season. Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including some non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads 'wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year'. There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer, Christmas song lyrics or Biblical verse; others focus on the general holiday season with an all-inclusive 'Season's greetings'. The first modern Christmas card was by John Calcott Horsley. A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves. History The world's first commercially produced Christmas card, designed by John Callcott Horsley for Henry Cole in 1843 Children looking at Christmas cards in New York 1910 Christmas card by Louis Prang, showing a group of anthropomorphized frogs parading with banner and band. The first known Christmas card was sent by Michael Maier to James I of England and his son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1611. It was discovered in 1979 by Adam McLean in the Scottish Record Office. It was hand-made and incorporated Rosicrucian imagery, with the words of the greeting – 'A greeting on the birthday of the Sacred King, to the most worshipful and energetic lord and most eminent James, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Defender of the true faith, with a gesture of joyful celebration of the Birthday of the Lord, in most joyand fortune, we enter into the new auspicious year 1612' – being laid out to form a rose. The first commercially available card was commissioned by Sir Henry Cole and designed by John Callcott Horsley in London 1843. The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor. Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each. Early British cards rarely showed winter or religious themes, instead favoring flowers, fairies and other fanciful designs that reminded the recipient of the approach of spring. Humorous and sentimental images of children and animals were popular, as were increasingly elaborate shapes, decorations and materials. At Christmas 1873, the lithograph firm Prang and Mayer began creating greeting cards for the popular market in Britain. The firm began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874, thus becoming the first printer to offer cards in America. Its owner, Louis Prang, is sometimes called the 'father of the American Christmas card.' By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the chromolithography process of printmaking. However, the popularity of his cards led to cheap imitations that eventually drove him from the market. The advent of the postcard spelled the end for elaborate Victorian-style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day, including Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card. The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand Hallmark Cards was established in 1913 by Joyce Hall with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards. The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of World War I increased demand for cards to send to soldiers. The World Wars brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic 'studio cards' with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of Victorian and Edwardian cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004. Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters – especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone. Some card manufacturers now provide E-cards. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period. In mostly non-religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are called New Year Cards; they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols. Official Christmas cards President Johnson's 1967 White House Christmas card 'Official' Christmas cards began with Queen Victoria in the 1840s. The British royal family's cards are generally portraits reflecting significant personal events of the year. There is a long-standing custom for the American President and First Lady to send White House Christmas Cards each holiday season. The practice originated with President Calvin Coolidge, who was the first president to issue a written statement of peaceful tidings during the holidays in 1927. President Herbert Hoover was the first to give Christmas notes to the White House staff, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to utilize the card format (rather than the previously used notes or a written statement) that most closely resembles the Christmas cards of today. In 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first official White House card. The cards usually depict White House scenes as rendered by prominent American artists. The number of recipients has snowballed over the decades, from just 2,000 in 1961 to 1.4 million in 2005. Commercial Christmas cards Tucker Corporation Christmas Card, 1947 Many organizations produce special Christmas cards as a fundraising tool. The most famous of these enterprises is probably the UNICEF Christmas card program, launched in 1949, which selects artwork from internationally known artists for card reproduction. The UK-based Charities Advisory Trust used to give out an annual 'Scrooge Award' to the cards that return the smallest percentage to the charities they claim to support although it is not universally well received by the Christmas card producers. The RSPB produced the first ever charity Christmas card in 1898, selling 4,500 that year  Christmas stamps and stickers Santa Coming Down the Chimney Many countries produce official Christmas stamps, which may be brightly coloured and depict some aspect of Christmas tradition or a Nativity scene. Small decorative stickers are also made to seal the back of envelopes, typically showing a trinket or some symbol of Christmas. From the beginning, Christmas cards have been avidly collected. Queen Mary amassed a large collection that is now housed in the British Museum. The University College London's Slade School of Fine Art houses a collection of handmade Christmas Cards from alumni such as Paula Rego and Richard Hamilton and are displayed at events over the Christmas season, when members of the public can make their own Christmas cards in the Strang Print Room. Specimens from the 'golden age' of printing (1840s–1890s) are especially prized and bring in large sums at auctions. In December 2005, one of Horsley's original cards sold for nearly £9,000. Collectors may focus on particular images like Santa Claus, poets, or printing techniques. The Christmas card that holds the world record as the most expensive ever sold was a card produced in 1843 by J. C. Horsley and commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole. The card, one of the world's first, was sold in 2001 by UK auctioneers Henry Aldridge to an anonymous bidder for a record breaking £22,250. \n",

      "He reads from a book. 'Every one of us is a fiddler on the roof, trying to scratch out a pleasant simple tune without breaking his neck. It isn’t easy….' He sheds the parka and a century or more, puts on a cap and a prayer shaw, and sings Tradition. There he is, Tevye, in the wonderfully comic and soulful performance by Jonathan Hashmonay the loveable beleaguered Jewish dairyman of the classic musical, in a Russian shtetl in the early 20th century.

Randa Meierhenry, GraceAnn Kontak and Yardén Barr as Tzeitel, Hodel and the bookish Chava have great charm and sisterly chemistry. And their shared song Matchmaker Matchmaker, as they dream of romantic happiness, is a knockout. So is Hodel’s delivery of Far From The Home I Love, a heartbreaking lament of displacement.

      "'Far From The Home I Love' was more heartfelt than the rest which is what makes it one of my favorites. It’s sung by Hodel and my favorite part is when she sings: 'Hopeless now I stand with him, watching older dreams grow dim. Oh, what a melancholy choice this is, wanting home, wanting him. Closing my heart to every hope but his, leaving the home I love.' From the sets, to the performances and music I loved every second. I would recommend this extremely captivating musical to anyone. #amarillocollge#musical#rangerstaff#theranger PreviousCorey Kent Paves His Career With Third Album NextJason Michael Carroll Releases New Summer Song Be the first to comment Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.CommentName * Email * Website Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

      "Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and book by Joseph Stein, set in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia in or around 1905. It is based on Tevye and his Daughters (or Tevye the Dairyman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. The story centers on Tevye, a milkman in the village of Anatevka, who attempts to maintain his Jewish religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon his family's lives. He must cope with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters who wish to marry for love; their choices of husbands are successively less palatable for Tevye. An edict of the tsar eventually evicts the Jews from their village. \n",
      "Fiddler on the Roof is based on Tevye (or Tevye the Dairyman) and his Daughters, a series of stories by Sholem Aleichem that he wrote in Yiddish between 1894 and 1914 about Jewish life in a village in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia at the turn of the 20th century. The stories are based on Aleichem's own upbringing near modern-day Kyiv (fictionalized as Yehupetz). It is also influenced by Life is with People, by Mark Zborowski and Elizabeth Herzog. Aleichem wrote a dramatic adaptation of the stories that he left unfinished at his death, but which was produced in Yiddish in 1919 by the Yiddish Art Theater and made into a film in the 1930s. In the late 1950s, a musical based on the stories, called Tevye and his Daughters, was produced off-Broadway by Arnold Perl. Rodgers and Hammerstein and then Mike Todd briefly considered bringing this musical to Broadway but dropped the idea. The Fiddler by Marc Chagall, c. 1912 Investors and some in the media worried that Fiddler on the Roof might be considered 'too Jewish' to attract mainstream audiences. Other critics considered that it was too culturally sanitized, 'middlebrow' and superficial; Philip Roth, writing in The New Yorker, called it shtetl kitsch. For example, it portrays the local Russian officer as sympathetic, instead of brutal and cruel, as Sholom Aleichem had described him. Aleichem's stories ended with Tevye alone, his wife dead and his daughters scattered; at the end of Fiddler, the family members are alive, and most are emigrating together to America. The show found the right balance for its time, even if not entirely authentic, to become 'one of the first popular post-Holocaust depictions of the vanished world of Eastern European Jewry'. Harold Prince replaced the original producer Fred Coe and brought in director/choreographer Jerome Robbins. The writers and Robbins considered naming the musical Tevye, before landing on a title suggested by various paintings by Marc Chagall (Green Violinist (1924), Le Mort (1924), The Fiddler (1912)) that also inspired the original set design. Contrary to popular belief, the 'title of the musical does not refer to any specific painting'. \n",
      "The Santa Clara Vanguard Drum and Bugle Corps performs the 'Bottle Dance' from Fiddler as a 'recurring trademark', including at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Other The song 'Sunrise, Sunset' is often played at weddings, and in 2011 Sheldon Harnick wrote two versions of the song, suitable for same-sex weddings, with minor word changes. For example, for male couples, changes include 'When did they grow to be so handsome'. In 2015 a displaced persons camp southwest of Kyiv named Anatevka was built by Chabad Rabbi Moshe Azman to house the Jews fleeing the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Awards Main article: List of awards and nominations for Fiddler on the Roof Fiddler's original Broadway production in 1964 was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning nine, including Best Musical, score, and book, and Robbins won for best direction and choreography. \n",
      "Fiddler on the Roof is set in the small town of Anatevka during the last days of czarist Russia. Tevye, a poor milkman, lives with his five daughters and his wife, Golde, as they try to uphold the traditions and culture of the Jewish people in their community. Tevye and Golde’s daughters begin to rebel against these traditions as they forge their paths in life by following their hearts. As word spreads of Jewish people being forced out of their homes and towns, worry spreads that the same fate will befall Anatevka. Set against the pogroms that displaced countless Jewish people in the late 19th and early 20th century, Fiddler on the Roof highlights the cruelty Jewish people faced during this time. \n",

      "The eighth and final season of The CW’s supernatural teen drama wrapped four years years ago, but will fans ever get to see The Vampire Diaries season 9? Based on the best-selling book series by L.J. Smith, The Vampire Diaries was developed for the small screen by Dawson’s Creek creator Kevin Williamson with his long-time collaborator Julie Plec and premiered on The CW in 2009. Set in the picturesque, but paranormal town of Mystic Falls, the long-running series focused on the vampire love triangle between protagonists Elena (Nina Dobrev), Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) and his brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder), alongside the town’s other human and not-so-human inhabitants. The Vampire Diaries spawned not one, but two spinoffs – The Originals and Legacies – and developed a loyal fan following over its eight seasons on the air. The show enjoyed a good run and its season 8 finale wrapped up most of its unresolved storylines nicely in an epic episode that featured some major character deaths and a few happy endings. Related: Preacher Finally Reveals How Cassidy Became A Vampire Despite its satisfying finale fans of the show still hope another season might be on the cards, but could The Vampire Diaries season 9 ever happen? The CW Canceled The Vampire Diaries In 2017 Just a few months after The CW renewed the show for its eighth season, showrunner Julie Plec announced The Vampire Diaries would end with season 8, feeling the show had come to a natural end. Fans may have been disappointed then, but the knowledge that season 8 would be the show’s last allowed its makers to craft a final season that tied up loose ends and bid a proper farewell to its characters. The Vampire Diaries Season 9 Isn’t Likely Star Ian Somerhalder has stated several times he feels The Vampire Diaries chapter of his career is closed and seeing as Nina Dobrev left the show in season 6 and only returned for the finale, it doesn’t seem likely she’d be interested in filming a ninth season. More recently, Somerhalder appeared on Andy Cohen Live and seemed to lay the rumors to rest regarding his and Dobrev's return for a season 9. In his words: 'I have not heard anything about a season nine…I mean, like, what would happen? Stefan and Damon…Damon has, like, gray hair and…they have canes?... Listen, it ran a great course and now it’s still living. That’s what’s so amazing. It’s still living.' \n",
      "Based on the book series by L. J. Smith, the fan-favorite series aired from 2009 to 2017 and starred Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley, Candice King, Steven R. McQueen, Ian Somerhalder, Kat Graham, Zach Roerig, Michael Trevino and Matthew Davis. Throughout its reign on The CW, The Vampire Diaries‘ success spawned two spinoff series, The Originals and Legacies. While the original stars have since moved on from their time in the fictional supernatural town, is there any chance for some of them to return? In June 2021, following a viral photo of Nina and Kat’s sweet reunion shared via Instagram, the 17 Again alum shared her thoughts on fans’ hope for a reboot. 'I don’t think Nina and I are interested in that, but I think our friendship will be forever,' Kat told TMZ. 'Seasons end but some friendships will be forever. She’s a really great person, and she’s really strong and she always really had my back on that show.' \n",

(2014-present)Websitebeatsbydre.com Beats Electronics LLC (also known as Beats by Dr. Dre, or simply Beats by Dre) is an American consumer audio products manufacturer headquartered in Culver City, California. The company was founded in 2006 by music producer Dr. Dre and record company executive Jimmy Iovine. Since 2014, it has been an Apple subsidiary. The subsidiary's product line is primarily focused on headphones and speakers. The company's original product line was manufactured in partnership with the AV equipment company Monster Cable Products. Following the end of its contract with the company, Beats took further development of its products in-house. In 2014, the company expanded into the online music market with the launch of a subscription-based streaming service, Beats Music. In 2011, NPD Group reported that Beats' market share was 64% in the U.S. for headphones priced higher than $100, and the brand was valued at $1 billion in September 2013. \n",
      "Beats was established in 2006 by music producer Dr. Dre and record company executive Jimmy Iovine.[citation needed] Iovine perceived two key problems in the music industry: the impact of piracy on music sales and the substandard audio quality provided by Apple's plastic earbuds. Iovine recalled that Dre said to him: 'Man, it's one thing that people steal my music. It's another thing to destroy the feeling of what I've worked on.' Iovine sought the opinions of musicians with 'great taste', such as M.I.A., Pharrell Williams, will.i.am, and Gwen Stefani during the early developmental stage. Beats initially partnered with inventor Noel Lee and his company Monster Cable, an audio and video component manufacturer based in Brisbane, California, to manufacture and develop the first Beats-branded products, and debuted its first product, Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones, on July 25, 2008. Jimmy Iovine and David Guetta \n",
      "In October 2012, Beats unveiled its first two self-developed products, 'Beats Executive' headphones and 'Beats Pill' wireless speakers—Iovine believed that the company would now have to 'control [its] own destiny' in order to continue its growth. Iovine also commented on how other headphone makers had attempted to emulate Beats' celebrity endorsement business model (including Monster themselves, who unveiled Earth, Wind and Fire and Miles Davis-themed headphones at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show), stating that 'some of our competitors are cheap engineers who have never been to a recording studio. You can't just stick someone's name on a headphone that doesn't know anything about sound.' Following the decision to transform Beats into an autonomous entity, the company's revenues reached the $1 billion mark, according to Iovine. HTC sale and Beats Music Logo for Beats Music \n",
      "Changing the way we listen to music, then and now. Beats headphones: A sonic revolution In 2006, famed hip-hop producer Dr. Dre felt listening audiences all deserved the same high-quality sound that he experienced  in the studio. So he partnered with industry mogul Jimmy Iovine to create Beats by Dre. Their goal was simple: create headphones that help people hear all the music. Achieving their goal meant creating electronics that could bring the experience and emotion of hearing music in a professional recording studio to the headphones used by everyday music fans. And it worked. Just as Dre imagined,  Beats Electronics has become known for its unparalleled audio quality, as well as its supreme style. In 2014, Apple acquired the brand, elevating Beats’ tech capabilities even further. Over the years Beats has evolved and expanded its product line to cater to the diverse needs of many listening audiences. Here’s a wrap-up of Beats’ sonic journey. Beats by Dr. Dre Studio: Redefining audio luxury. July 2008—Beats headphones took the world by storm with the release of Beats by Dr. Dre Studio, the company’s first product.

Updated versions of these original Beats headphones are available through Verizon and include Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones and Beats Studio3 Wireless Over-Ear Headphones. Beats by Dr. Dre Executive: Elevated sophistication. October 2012—Building on the success of its inaugural line, Beats introduced the Executive headphones. These wireless Beats headphones catered more to music professionals and discerning audiophiles. With their sleek aluminum design, noise-canceling technology and impressive battery life, they became the go-to choice for those who demanded both performance and style. Beats Pill: A portable speaker in a capsule. October 2012—The Beats Pill was the brand’s first, non-headset-related product release. This sleek, easily transportable speaker had a capsule-based design with a curved appearance and used Bluetooth to connect to other devices. In 2013, the Beats Pill 2.0 was released, which featured longer battery life and a port for charging other USB devices. Other features included the ability to pair Pills together with near-field communication (NFC) to play the same audio either individually on other devices or to be able to play left and right stereo channels simultaneously. Beats Solo2: The beat goes on. \n",
      "September 2016—The Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones brought a game-changing feature: the Apple W1 chip. This technology made pairing the headphones with Apple devices seamless.

They also featured Quick Charge, allowing for new buds to last up to two hours from a single five-minute charge. Beats Studio3 Wireless: Sound for any surrounding. June 2017—Beats Studio3 Wireless raised the bar yet again by introducing Pure Adaptive Noise Canceling (Pure ANC). This innovation ensured that the headphones adjusted their noise cancellation in real-time to match the listener's surroundings.

      "Johnny Depp plays Whitey Bulger in \u001b[92m\"Black Mass\" [1]\u001b[0m. Dakota Johnson plays Bulger's girlfriend, Lindsey Cyr.\n",
      "Black Mass, unfortunately, is not a film noir. It could have been, perhaps even a great one, but instead it’s resolutely a gangster film, chronicling the rise and fall of Boston’s notorious Winter Hill gang, using a flashback structure that’s largely dispassionate and aloof. Except, that is, when it zeroes in on the evil malevolence of gang leader James 'Whitey' Bulger—then Black Mass becomes something unique and perversely unsettling—a gangster film-horror movie hybrid. As portrayed by Johnny Depp, Bulger is the Devil incarnate, a psychotic manipulator whose notions of loyalty—and his (perhaps) chemically enhanced paranoia—drive him to compulsively murder the suspected traitors in his midst. \n",
      "Sienna Miller’s role as Bulger’s girlfriend Christine Greig was cut entirely, which makes me suspect the filmmakers had intended to broaden and deepen the story, only to be cut off at the knees by the moneymen: a fast-paced gangster-horror hybrid was probably just what they wanted—character studies and moral dilemmas don’t make for boffo box office. Personally, I’d have preferred more screen time for the women in Black Mass, all of whom give indelible performances—before each vanishes completely. A distaff perspective would have been such welcome respite from yet more scenes of guys shouting (albeit with Boston accents) 'No, fuck you!' at each other. (Note: the guys in the shitty suits shouting 'No, fuck you!' are the good guys; the guys in the horrible pleather jackets shouting 'No, fuck you!' are the bad guys.) \n",
      "Black Mass is a 2015 American biographical crime drama film about American mobster Whitey Bulger. Directed by Scott Cooper and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth, it is based on Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill's 2001 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob. The film features an ensemble cast led by Johnny Depp as Bulger, alongside Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Peter Sarsgaard, Dakota Johnson, and Corey Stoll. Principal photography of the film took place in Boston between May and August 2014. The film had its world premiere at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival and was released by Warner Bros. worldwide on September 18, 2015. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $100 million on a $53 million budget. Plot \n",
      "Johnny Depp's involvement with Black Mass dates back to February 2013, when he was attached to star in the film, while Barry Levinson was still slated to direct and principal photography was scheduled to begin in May 2013. Depp briefly exited the project shortly after its sale at the 66th annual Cannes Film Festival, because of a salary dispute with Cross Creek Pictures. He later rejoined at around the same time Scott Cooper was attached to replace Levinson as director, and his signing for the film was made official in February 2014. Jesse Plemons and Juno Temple joined the cast to play as Kevin Weeks (a cohort of Bulger) and Deborah Hussey, one of Bulger's victims, respectively, around April 2014. Plemons reportedly prepared for his role by hiring a dialect coach and studying video of the actual Kevin Weeks. \n",
      "The roles of Connolly – who was Whitey Bulger's FBI handler – and his first wife Marianne, were filled by Joel Edgerton and Julianne Nicholson, respectively. Cooper chose Nicholson for the part after her performance as Sally in Sam Shepard's off-Broadway play Heartless (before Claire van der Boom succeeded her for the play's two-week extension). Edgerton developed his portrayal of Connolly by studying past footage of the FBI agent before his imprisonment, some of which include his appearances on talk shows and in courtrooms. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Edgerton stated that he declined trying to meet with the actual Connolly, reasoning that Connolly 'has one version of events and the film has a different version'. Edgerton originally dropped out of the project when Depp agreed to return, and Tom Hardy was in early talks for the role. However, Edgerton returned in the role. \n",
      "On June 9, Depp's 51st birthday, he was filming scenes on location in Quincy, while Dakota Johnson was in Back Bay, playing Whitey Bulger's longtime former girlfriend, Lindsey Cyr. On June 11, shooting was underway in Lynn, where the crew was filming scenes in which Bulger and Stephen Flemmi pick up a prostitute named Deborah Hussey (played by Juno Temple) from the police station. Temple was seen on the set. On June 16, Depp and Plemons were spotted on the set of the film in South Boston. \n",
      "On July 15, Cumberbatch wrapped filming for his part in Boston. On July 21, Depp filmed some scenes at the former Anthony's Hawthorne restaurant, located at Oxford Street and Central Avenue in Lynn, which wrapped up filming for his role. In July, director Cooper told The Boston Globe that filming had to take place for two more weeks in Boston, focusing on the FBI's role in the Bulger story. On July 25, Kevin Bacon was in Boston, filming some remaining scenes for the film. According to The Boston Globe, filming for Black Mass wrapped up on August 1, 2014, in Boston. Post-production Sienna Miller was cast and filmed scenes as Catherine Greig, Bulger's companion while a fugitive, but her scenes ended up getting cut from the film due to 'narrative choices'. Erica McDermott was cast as Mary Bulger, wife of Billy Bulger, but the majority of her scenes were cut out. Release \n",
      "In Black Mass, Johnny Depp transforms into notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. Black Mass is based on the true story of gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. Author: Kim Holcomb and KING 5 Evening (KING) Published: 8:24 PM PDT September 17, 2015 Updated: 8:24 PM PDT September 17, 2015 SEATTLE - He's known for being something of a shape-shifter, and in Black Mass Johnny Depp transforms into notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. 'I had done so much research and had seen photos of Jimmy Bulger, and to see him, the resemblance is uncanny,' said actress Dakota Johnson. The Fifty Shades of Grey star plays Bulger's girlfriend. She's just one member of an all-star cast who recreate the era when the gangster worked as an FBI informant in exchange for the agency turning a blind eye to his own criminal enterprise. \n",
      "'Black Mass,' about the tangled criminal history of Boston gang boss James 'Whitey' Bulger, is a bizarre movie. It really doesn't work until you tune into its wavelength. But if can do that, you may start to see method behind the film's madness and end up feeling as I did—that for all of its flaws, it's the first film since 'Eastern Promises' that has added anything truly fresh to the old school street-level gangster story.The general outlines wouldn't seem to promise anything like that sort of experience, and Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk's screenplay sometimes treats its flashback structure (articulated through FBI interrogations of key Bulger associates) as an excuse to tell, even summarize, rather than show. Testimonials become voice-over narration that papers over holes in the chronology. We meet Bulger and two powerful people who shield and enable him: his senator brother William 'Billy' Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his childhood friend turned FBI agent James Connolly (Joel Edgerton). We watch as Connolly hatches a plan to pay back Bulger, who protected him when they were kids, by helping the gangster inform on the Italian mob that's muscling in on his turf—essentially offering up the FBI as Bulger's unwitting private army, waging war on rivals. We meet Bulger's doting girlfriend Lindsey Cyr (Dakota Johnson) and his adorable son, Douglas Cyr (Luke Ryan), and of course Bulger's criminal gang; their ranks include Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, and the great W. Earl Brown, who's turning into the Warren Oates of modern urban potboilers. All of the performers are superb and have at least one indelible moment, but remain rather undefined as individuals. They fade in and out of the story willy-nilly, and sometimes when one of them shows up again you're surprised to see him because you forgot he was still alive. The sole exception is Peter Sarsgaard, whose supporting turn as a jumpy cokehead sums up a man's pathetic life in just four scenes. \n",
      "Cyr dated Bulger for 12 years and said she knew nothing of his murderous dark side. She said she only saw a loving father to their son, Douglass.Dakota Johnson plays Cyr in Black Mass, but Cyr said scenes from the film misrepresent Bulger's relationship with his son, who died at age six after a severe reaction to medicine.''If you do something and no one sees it, you didn't do it,'' Cyr repeated a line from the movie. 'I would have smacked him in the back of the head and said, 'What the hell are you talking about?''Cyr does not give the movie high praise and said she's also critical of the U.S. attorney's new attempt to tack more time onto Catherine Greig's sentence as they try to determine how she and Bulger managed to elude capture for 16 years.'That woman never had a choice in anything that happened from the minute she said 'Yes dear I'll go with you,'' Cyr said.

      "Story structure is essential to the psychological appeal of a narrative. It engages readers, builds anticipation, and creates a desire to know what happens next. This blog post aims to demonstrate the creative universality of story structure with a plot analysis of the classic novel Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery. By David G Brown Anne of Green Gables tells the story of a young orphan girl named Anne Shirley who is mistakenly sent to live with a pair of elderly siblings, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, on Prince Edward Island. Despite Marilla’s initial reluctance to keep her, Anne's charm, intelligence, and imaginative spirit soon win over their hearts and those of the entire community. Coming of Age A coming-of-age narrative, also known as a bildungsroman, is often structured differently than most novels. The overall trajectory involves the character growing up through a series of formative experiences, but if we dig into the different relationship threads, it’s usually possible to find the one goal that forms the story’s backbone. To put that another way, the primary narrative goal is an arrow fired in the inciting incident which will hit a target in the climax. However, in a coming-of-age story, that goal isn’t necessarily something the protagonist pursues on every page. Anne of Green Gables offers many episodic threads that work together to deeply characterize herself, her adoptive parents, and many of the other residents of Avonlea. There is one thread, however, that directly connects the inciting incident with the climax: her relationship with Matthew. Narrative Goal Anne’s narrative journey is primarily relational—she wants to be accepted and loved, but she also has an irrepressible desire to speak her mind and express herself. Therefore, the plot grows out of several relationship threads in which Anne strives for love and acceptance. Her obstacles include the town’s initial prejudices toward orphans and Anne’s blunt tongue and temper. Anne’s narrative goal crystalizes in her cart ride from the train station to her new home in Avonlea—a scene in which it’s clear Anne and Matthew have an instant bond. Quite simply, Anne’s goal is that she doesn’t want to lose Matthew. Plot Points Stasis Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, aging and unmarried siblings, decide to adopt a boy to help them around the farm. Anne is an orphan and has been moving from one foster home to another before she is sent by mistake to the Green Gables farm in Avonlea. Inciting incident Since the primary trajectory grows out of Anne’s desire to become Matthew’s adopted daughter, the point of no return is when Matthew confesses to Marilla that he doesn’t mind that they were sent a girl in error—he likes Anne and would like to keep her. There is no returning from this declaration of affection. With their bond established, the stakes are set. The reader knows exactly what they both stand to lose—each other. Rising action?! Anne of Green Gables has an unusual story shape not only because it’s a coming-of-age narrative but also because it’s a tragedy. So while there is episodic rising action as Anne moves through various challenges, conflicts, and learning experiences, there is also an easing of tension as the original threat—that she might be sent back to the orphanage—fades from possibility. \n",
      "Anne of Green Gables is a 1908 novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery (published as L. M. Montgomery). Written for all ages, it has been considered a classic children's novel since the mid-20th century. Set in the late 19th century, the novel recounts the adventures of 11-year-old orphan girl Anne Shirley sent by mistake to two middle-aged siblings, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, who had originally intended to adopt a boy to help them on their farm in the fictional town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The novel recounts how Anne makes her way through life with the Cuthberts, in school, and within the town. Since its publication, Anne of Green Gables has been translated into at least 36 languages and has sold more than 50 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books worldwide. It was the first of many novels; Montgomery wrote numerous sequels, and since her death another sequel has been published, as well as an authorized prequel titled Before Green Gables. This prequel was written in 2008 by Budge Wilson to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the book series. The original book is taught to students around the world. The book has been adapted as films, television films, and animated and live-action television series. Musicals and plays have also been created, with productions annually in Canada, Europe and Japan. Background The portrait of Evelyn Nesbit by Rudolf Eickemeyer Jr. which inspired Montgomery In writing the novel, Montgomery was inspired by notes she had made as a young girl about two siblings who were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of the boy they had requested, yet decided to keep her. She drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island, Canada. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New York's Metropolitan Magazine and put on the wall of her bedroom as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her 'youthful idealism and spirituality.' Montgomery was inspired by the 'formula Ann' orphan stories (called such because they followed such a predictable formula) that were popular at the time, but distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra 'e'. She based other characters, such as Gilbert Blythe, in part on people she knew. She said she wrote the novel in the twilight of the day, while sitting at her window and overlooking the fields of Cavendish. Summary \n",
      "Publication history Anne of Green Gables was first published by L.C. Page & Co. of Boston on June 13, 1908. The book quickly became a best-seller, selling over 19,000 copies in the first five months. Since then, over 50 million copies have been sold worldwide. A full scan of the first edition, first impression is provided by the L. M. Montgomery Institute. Montgomery's original manuscript is preserved by the Confederation Centre of the Arts, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Since 2022, the Centre has hosted a project in which digital images of the entire manuscript can be examined online. A transcript of the manuscript was published by Nimbus Publishing in 2019. Montgomery's original typescript and the corrected proofs are lost. \n",
      "In case you haven’t seen the show or read the books—if you’re not a woman about my age or Canadian—here’s the plot in brief: Anne Shirley is a scrawny, redheaded orphan who has been passed between unwelcoming orphanages and adoptive homes (where she tended to serve as a caretaker for the family’s birth children) throughout her childhood. Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert are aging siblings who decide to adopt a young boy to help them run their farm (the titular Green Gables) on Prince Edward Island. Through a misunderstanding, they end up with Anne instead. Marilla immediately wants to send her back, as they have 'no use' for a girl, but Anne has already fallen in love with the place, and Matthew is immediately taken with her. They opt for a kind of trial run. The ill-bred, outspoken Anne gets into a series of near deal-breaking mishaps but eventually wins Marilla over and stays. \n",
      "Anne of Green GablesOriginal Off-Broadway Version (2007)Anne of Green Gables follows the misadventures of a wildly independent orphan with fiery red hair and a temper to match. Cherished by generations, L.M. Montgomery's timeless classic comes to life in a new musical commissioned by the award-winning Theatreworks USA. Anne Shirley is mistakenly sent to live with a plainspoken farmer and his spinster sister, who thought they were adopting a boy! She wins over the Cuthberts and all of Prince Edward Island with her irrepressible spirit and imagination — and wins over audiences with this warm, poignant story about love, home and family. \n",

      "This is a major consideration that needs to be taken into account. The worldwide, catastrophic Flood of Noah’s day would have destroyed the surface of the earth. If most of the sedimentary strata over the earth’s surface (many thousands of feet thick in places) is the result of this global catastrophe as creationists believe, then we would have no idea where the Garden of Eden was originally located—the earth’s surface totally changed as a result of the Flood. Not only this, but underneath the region where the present Tigris and Euphrates Rivers are located, there exists hundreds of feet of sedimentary strata—a significant amount of which is fossiliferous. Such fossil-bearing strata had to be laid down at the time of the Flood. \n",
      "Fertile river valleys were cradles to four of the earliest civilizations: the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in South Asia, and the Yangtze and Yellow in China, explained Brown University geographer Laurence Smith. At the same time, rivers have long been used to divide lands. After visiting multiple rivers around the world, Smith became fascinated by the concept of the waterways as political borders. However, he also was surprised to find that little quantitative research on river borders is available—and even less that makes use of modern geospatial mapping techniques. With the help of Sarah Popelka, a student at UCLA, he set out to change that. \n",
      "North America (28 percent), Africa (26 percent), and Europe (21 percent) also have sizable percentages of borders defined by rivers. For North America, the Rio Grande, which separates Mexico and Texas, accounts for much of that. But the Pigeon River serves as the boundary between parts of Ontario and Minnesota; the Saint Lawrence divides Ontario and New York; and the Saint John River forms part of the boundary between New Brunswick and Maine. Rivers also serve as borders in several African countries: Benin, Nigeria, Senegal, Mauritania, and Niger in West Africa; the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, and Mozambique in Central Africa; and Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Namibia in Southern Africa. In Europe, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Poland, Norway, Bosnia, Romania, and Ukraine are just some of the many countries with international border rivers. \n",
      "The Tigris passes through historical cities like Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad. In ancient times, the Tigris nurtured the Assyrian Empire, with remnants like the relief of King Tiglath-Pileser. The Tigris is home to archaeological sites and ancient religious communities, including the Mandaeans, who use it for baptism. Today, the Tigris faces modern threats from geopolitical instability, dam projects, poor water management, and climate change, leading to concerns about its sustainability. Efforts to protect and preserve the river's legacy are ongoing, with local archaeologists and activists working to safeguard its future. Etymology Bedouin crossing the river Tigris with plunder (c. 1860) The Tigris is 1,750 km (1,090 mi) long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about 25 km (16 mi) southeast of the city of Elazığ and about 30 km (19 mi) from the headwaters of the Euphrates. The river then flows for 400 km (250 mi) through Southeastern Turkey before forming part of the Syria-Turkey border. This stretch of 44 km (27 mi) is the only part of the river that is located in Syria. Some of its affluences are Garzan, Anbarçayi, Batman, and the Great and the Little Zab. Close to its confluence with the Euphrates, the Tigris splits into several channels. First, the artificial Shatt al-Hayy branches off, to join the Euphrates near Nasiriyah. Second, the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir branch off to feed the Central Marshes. Further downstream, two other distributary channels branch off (the Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla), to feed the Hawizeh Marshes. The main channel continues southwards and is joined by the Al-Kassarah, which drains the Hawizeh Marshes. Finally, the Tigris joins the Euphrates near al-Qurnah to form the Shatt-al-Arab. According to Pliny and other ancient historians, the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris. Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, stands on the banks of the Tigris. The port city of Basra straddles the Shatt al-Arab. In ancient times, many of the great cities of Mesopotamia stood on or near the Tigris, drawing water from it to irrigate the civilization of the Sumerians. Notable Tigris-side cities included Nineveh, Ctesiphon, and Seleucia, while the city of Lagash was irrigated by the Tigris via a canal dug around 2900 B.C. Navigation The Tigris has long been an important transport route in a largely desert country. Shallow-draft vessels can go as far as Baghdad, but rafts have historically been needed for transport downstream from Mosul. Management and water quality Batman River The Tigris is heavily dammed in Iraq and Turkey to provide water for irrigating the arid and semi-desert regions bordering the river valley. Damming has also been important for averting floods in Iraq, to which the Tigris has historically been notoriously prone following April melting of snow in the Turkish mountains. Mosul Dam is the largest dam in Iraq. Recent Turkish damming of the river has been the subject of some controversy, for both its environmental effects within Turkey and its potential to reduce the flow of water downstream. Water from both rivers is used as a means of pressure during conflicts. In 2014 a major breakthrough in developing consensus between multiple stakeholder representatives of Iraq and Turkey on a Plan of Action for promoting exchange and calibration of data and standards pertaining to Tigris river flows was achieved. The consensus, known as the 'Geneva Consensus On Tigris River', was reached at a meeting organized in Geneva by the think tank Strategic Foresight Group. In February 2016, the United States Embassy in Iraq as well as the Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi issued warnings that Mosul Dam could collapse. The United States warned people to evacuate the floodplain of the Tigris because between 500,000 and 1.5 million people were at risk of drowning due to flash flood if the dam collapses, and that the major Iraqi cities of Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad were at risk. Religion and mythology In Sumerian mythology, the Tigris was created by the god Enki, who filled the river with flowing water. In Hittite and Hurrian mythology, Aranzah (or Aranzahas in the Hittite nominative form) is the Hurrian name of the Tigris River, which was deified. He was the son of Kumarbi and the brother of Teshub and Tašmišu, one of the three gods spat out of Kumarbi's mouth onto Mount Kanzuras. Later he colluded with Anu and the Teshub to destroy Kumarbi (The Kumarbi Cycle). The Tigris appears twice in the Old Testament. First, in the Book of Genesis, it is the third of the four rivers branching off the river issuing out of the Garden of Eden. The second mention is in the Book of Daniel, wherein Daniel states he received one of his visions 'when I was by that great river the Tigris'. \n",

Extracellular fluid has two primary constituents: the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and the interstitial fluid (IF) that surrounds all cells not in the blood. Intracellular Fluid \n",
      "In cell biology, extracellular fluid (ECF) denotes all body fluid outside the cells of any multicellular organism. Total body water in healthy adults is about 50–60% (range 45 to 75%) of total body weight; women and the obese typically have a lower percentage than lean men. Extracellular fluid makes up about one-third of body fluid, the remaining two-thirds is intracellular fluid within cells. The main component of the extracellular fluid is the interstitial fluid that surrounds cells. Extracellular fluid is the internal environment of all multicellular animals, and in those animals with a blood circulatory system, a proportion of this fluid is blood plasma. Plasma and interstitial fluid are the two components that make up at least 97% of the ECF. Lymph makes up a small percentage of the interstitial fluid. The remaining small portion of the ECF includes the transcellular fluid (about 2.5%). The ECF can also be seen as having two components – plasma and lymph as a delivery system, and interstitial fluid for water and solute exchange with the cells. The extracellular fluid, in particular the interstitial fluid, constitutes the body's internal environment that bathes all of the cells in the body. The ECF composition is therefore crucial for their normal functions, and is maintained by a number of homeostatic mechanisms involving negative feedback. Homeostasis regulates, among others, the pH, sodium, potassium, and calcium concentrations in the ECF. The volume of body fluid, blood glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels are also tightly homeostatically maintained. The volume of extracellular fluid in a young adult male of 70 kg (154 lbs) is 20% of body weight – about fourteen liters. Eleven liters are interstitial fluid and the remaining three liters are plasma. Components The main component of the extracellular fluid (ECF) is the interstitial fluid, or tissue fluid, which surrounds the cells in the body. The other major component of the ECF is the intravascular fluid of the circulatory system called blood plasma. \n",
      "Intracellular compartment The intracellular fluid (ICF) is all fluids contained inside the cells, which consists of cytosol and fluid in the cell nucleus. The cytosol is the matrix in which cellular organelles are suspended. The cytosol and organelles together compose the cytoplasm. The cell membranes are the outer barrier. In humans, the intracellular compartment contains on average about 28 liters (6.2 imp gal; 7.4 U.S. gal) of fluid, and under ordinary circumstances remains in osmotic equilibrium. It contains moderate quantities of magnesium and sulfate ions. In the cell nucleus, the fluid component of the nucleoplasm is called the nucleosol. Extracellular compartment The interstitial, intravascular and transcellular compartments comprise the extracellular compartment. Its extracellular fluid (ECF) contains about one-third of total body water. Intravascular compartment \n",
      "The interstitial compartment (also called 'tissue space') surrounds tissue cells. It is filled with interstitial fluid, including lymph. Interstitial fluid provides the immediate microenvironment that allows for movement of ions, proteins and nutrients across the cell barrier. This fluid is not static, but is continually being refreshed by the blood capillaries and recollected by lymphatic capillaries. In the average male (70-kilogram or 150-pound) human body, the interstitial space has approximately 10.5 liters (2.3 imp gal; 2.8 U.S. gal) of fluid. Transcellular compartment \n",
      "While fluid compartments may share some characteristics with the divisions defined by the anatomical compartments of the body, these terms are not one in the same. Fluid compartments are defined by their position relative to the cellular membrane of the cells that make up the body’s tissues. Intracellular Fluid The intracellular fluid of the cytosol or intracellular fluid (or cytoplasm ) is the fluid found inside cells. It is separated into compartments by membranes that encircle the various organelles of the cell. For example, the mitochondrial matrix separates the mitochondrion into compartments. The contents of a eukaryotic cell within the cell membrane, excluding the cell nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles (e.g., mitochondria, plastides, lumen of endoplasmic reticulum, etc.), is referred to as the cytoplasm. The cytosol: The cytosol (11) is the fluid within the plasma membrane of a cell and contains the organelles. The cytosol includes dissolved molecules and water. \n",
      "Body fluids can be discussed in terms of their specific fluid compartment, a location that is largely separate from another compartment by some form of a physical barrier. The intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment is the system that includes all fluid enclosed in cells by their plasma membranes. Extracellular fluid (ECF) surrounds all cells in the body. Extracellular fluid has two primary constituents: the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and the interstitial fluid (IF) that surrounds all cells not in the blood (Figure 26.1.2). Figure 26.1.2 – Fluid Compartments in the Human Body: The intracellular fluid (ICF) is the fluid within cells. The interstitial fluid (IF) is part of the extracellular fluid (ECF) between the cells. Blood plasma is the second part of the ECF. Materials travel between cells and the plasma in capillaries through the IF. Intracellular Fluid \n",
      "Total body water and fluid compartments For the average adult, nonobese dog or cat, total body water is approximately 60% of body weight. Geriatric pets will have less while neonates have considerably more, up to 75% of body weight total body water. Body water is distributed between two compartments known as intracellular fluid (ICF) space and extracellular fluid (ECF) space. The larger of the two is the intracellular compartment comprising two-thirds of total body water and 40% of body weight. The extracelluar compartment holds the remaining one-third of total body water and 20% of body weight. The extracellular compartment is further divided into intravascular fluid (plasma within the vessels) and interstitial fluid (between the cells). The interstitium, simply defined, is the connective structures and lubricating fluids located between cells. The majority of extracellular fluid is contained within the interstitium. \n",

      "Hot zones, which can be detected with a gloved hand, for example by touching a door before opening it; Soot on windows, which usually means that combustion is incomplete, and thus, a lack of air in the room; Smoke pulsing in and out around a door frame, as if the fire were breathing, which usually also means a lack of air to support combustion. Spraying water on the ceiling in short pulses of a diffused spray (e.g., a cone with an opening angle of 60°) can be undertaken to test the heat of smoke: If the temperature is moderate, the water falls down in drops with a sound like rain; if the temperature is high, the water vaporizes with a hiss—the sign of a potentially extremely dangerous impending flashover. Ideally, part of reconnaissance is consulting a plan for the building that provides information about structures, firefighter hazards, and in some cases the most appropriate strategies and tactics for fighting a fire in that context. \n",
      "Using water is one common method to extinguish a fire. Water extinguishes a fire by cooling, which removes heat because of water’s ability to absorb massive amounts of heat as it converts to water vapor. Without heat, the fuel cannot keep the oxidizer from reducing the fuel in order to sustain the fire. Water also extinguishes a fire by smothering it. When water is heated to its boiling point, it converts to water vapor. When this conversion takes place, it dilutes the oxygen in the air above the fire, thus removing one of the elements that the fire requires to burn. This can also be done with foam. Another way to extinguish a fire is fuel removal. This can be accomplished by stopping the flow of liquid or gaseous fuel, by removing solid fuel in the path of a fire, or by allowing the fire to burn until all the fuel is consumed, at which point the fire will self-extinguish. \n",
      "One common way to extinguish a fire is to spray it with water. The water has two roles: It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire, and this vapor displaces the oxygen (the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water, at 1,000 °F (538 °C) it expands over 4,000 times). This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent, and it dies out. The vaporization of water also absorbs heat; it thereby cools the smoke, air, walls, and objects that could act as further fuel, and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow, which is by 'jumping' to nearby heat/fuel sources to start new fires, which then combine. Water extinguishment is thus a combination of 'asphyxia' (cutting off the oxygen supply) and cooling. The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia, but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area. For outdoor fires, the seat of the fire is sprayed with a straight spray: the cooling effect immediately follows the 'asphyxia' caused by vaporization and reduces the further amount of water required. This is because water droplets, upon forming in to water mist, increase their surface area by a large magnitude, greatly increasing the endothermic cooling effect and robbing the fire of oxygen. A straight spray is used so the water arrives massively to the seat of the fire before it vaporizes. A strong spray may also have a mechanical effect; it can disperse the combustible product and thus prevent the fire from starting again. Spray is always aimed at a surface or an object. For this reason, the strategy is sometimes called a two-dimensional or 2D attack. Until the 1970s, fires were usually attacked while they declined, using the same strategy as for open air fires. Now fires are attacked in their development phase because firefighters arrive sooner at the site of a fire and because of changes in building construction. The increasing use of thermal insulation confines the heat, and modern materials, especially polymers, produce much more heat than do traditional materials like wood, plaster, stone, and bricks. Under these conditions, there is a greater risk of backdraft and flashover. Directly spraying the seat of the fire in enclosed areas can have unfortunate consequences: the force of water pushes air in front of it, which supplies the fire with extra oxygen before the water. The most important issue is not combating the flames, but controlling the fire; for example, cooling the smoke so that it cannot spread and start fires further away, and endanger the lives of people, including the firefighters. \n",
      "cools the smoke which is then less likely to start a fire when it moves away. As gas cools it becomes denser (Charles's law); thus, it also reduces the mobility of the smoke and avoids a 'backfire' of water vapor. Also, the diffuse spray creates an inert 'water vapor sky', which prevents 'roll-over' (rolls of flames on the ceiling created by hot burning gases). Only short pulses of water need to be sprayed, otherwise the spraying modifies the equilibrium, and the gases mix instead of remaining stratified: the hot gases (initially at the ceiling) move around the room, and the temperature rises at the ground, which is dangerous for firefighters. An alternative is to cool all the atmosphere by spraying the whole atmosphere as if drawing letters in the air ('penciling'). \n",
      "In such cases, it is necessary to asphyxiate the fire. This can be done in a variety of ways. Chemical products which react with the fuel can be used to stop the combustion. A layer of water-based fire retardant foam can be applied by the fire hose in order to separate the oxygen in the air from the fuel. carbon dioxide, halon, or sodium bicarbonate can be used. In the case of very small fires and in the absence of other extinguishing agents, covering the flame with a fire blanket can eliminate oxygen flow to the fire. A simple and usually effective way to put out a fire in a stove-top pan is to put a lid on the pan and leave it there. Tactical ventilation or isolation of the fire One of the main risks of a fire is the smoke; because, it carries heat and poisonous gases, and obscures vision. In the case of a fire in a closed location (building), the following two different strategies may be used: isolation of the fire or ventilation. \n",
      "A carbon dioxide extinguisher or a fire blanket can be used to remove oxygen from the area around the fire. The carbon dioxide extinguisher pulls oxygen away from the fire and replaces it with non-flammable, denser-than-air carbon dioxide. Fire blankets create a barrier around the fire to keep it from getting extra oxygen. Another method of drawing away oxygen would be closing doors during an evacuation of a building. This stops a new supply of oxygen from entering. Heat Heat automatically comes to mind when you think about fire. One of the best ways to weaken and ultimately put out a fire is to reduce its heat. A good example of this would be to blow out the flame of a candle. The candle stops burning when the heat is removed from it by the swiftly moving air. Heat not only increases the likelihood that a fire will start but also helps keep one going by eliminating moisture from fuel sources and warming the surroundings, making it easier for the fire to spread. \n",
      "Cooling with water is one of the most typical ways of putting out a fire. The fuel is cooled until it produces insufficient vapor to ignite. The drop in temperature is achieved by applying enough water to create a negative heat balance. Burning will stop if the rate at which heat is produced by combustion is lower than the rate at which heat is lost from the burning substance. The fire may eventually go out if the pace at which heat is lost from it exceeds the rate at which heat is produced. Due to its high thermal capacity, water is an effective cooling agent. This makes it the fire extinguishing chemical that is by far the most extensively used, and it is readily available in enormous amounts. Starving In certain instances, putting out a fire only requires removing the fuel source. There are several ways to do this, including stopping the flow of liquid, removing solid fuel from the fire’s path, or letting the fire burn until all the fuel is gone. \n",
      "Stopping combustion requires depriving the fire of one or more sides of the fire triangle, or by stopping the chemical chain reaction that sustains combustion—and that’s how standard fire extinguishing work. It’s important to use the right type of agent to extinguish the fire, so we have created an overview of how the most common types of agents work to disrupt the fire triangle/tetrahedron. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and inert gases put out Class B and C fires by removing oxygen from the fire triangle. While inert gases will also put out Class A fires, CO2 can be used for surface Class A fires only. Water-based systems put out Class A fires by removing heat from the fire triangle. Dry powders are available in a few different types, with different applications appropriate for Class A, B, or C fires, work by applying a thin layer of material to separate the fuel from surrounding oxygen, interrupting the chemical chain reaction that keeps a fire going. \n",

      "The revolt of 1857 was one of the most critical events in the history of the freedom struggle in India. It jolted the foundation of the East India Company in India and at one point people thought that it would be the downfall of the British Empire. What began as a revolt by soldiers, was soon joined by the farmers and other civilian populations. It is often referred to as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 or the First War of independence. Delhi, the capital of the Mughal Empire, became the epicentre of the rebellion. \n",
      "The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India,[b][c] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.[d] The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region,[e] and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.[f] The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, and scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule.[g] Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule.[h] Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.[i] After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm.[j] In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support.[k] The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as 'breakwaters in a storm'. \n",
      "The rebellion saw the end of the East India Company's rule in India. In August, by the Government of India Act 1858, the company's ruling powers over India were transferred to the British Crown. A new British government department, the India Office, was created to handle the governance of India, and its head, the Secretary of State for India, was entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General of India gained a new title, Viceroy of India, and implemented the policies devised by the India Office. Some former East India Company territories, such as the Straits Settlements, became colonies in their own right. The British colonial administration embarked on a program of reform, trying to integrate Indian higher castes and rulers into the government and abolishing attempts at Westernization. The Viceroy stopped land grabs, decreed religious tolerance and admitted Indians into civil service, albeit mainly as subordinates.[citation needed] \n",
      "The rebellions began on 10 May 1857. It started in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company’s army in the town of Meerut, This led to various other rebellions in other parts of the country like central India. These rebellions were considered a threat to the power of East India Company in India. This rebellion ended with the defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. After that, the British government granted amnesty to all rebels who were not involved in any kind of murder. This Rebellion officially ended in 1859. Revolt of 1857 Revolt of 1857 The Revolt of 1857 had a deep mark in the history of modern Indian history and the policy of the British changed after the revolt of 1857 and played a very important role in India and helped in the display of unity among the people and to rethink their existence in India. Consequences of the 1857 Revolt The important consequences of the Revolt of 1857 are as follows: British Crown Came to Power The revolt of 1857 caused the transfer of power from the East India Company to the crown of England and the achievement was possible under the Government of India Act of 1858; under which India came under the direct rule of the English crown. New Structure for the Indian Government The Indian council was formulated with 15 members, nine to serve India for at least ten years, and consisted of a state secretary, which was assisted by the council of India. With this, the framing of a new form of government with different types of rules became possible in India. Indian Army Reconstruction The Revolt of 1857 instilled a level of fear in the British government. The number of Indian soldiers in the Indian army came to be drastically reduced from 2 lakh to around 1 lakh 40 thousand in 1863 and the number of England soldiers had increased. Policy of Annexation Ended \n",
      "Indian Rebellion of 1857 was often referred to as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Indian Insurrection, the First War of Independence, and the Revolt of 1857. Indian Rebellion of 1857 is one of the first major uprisings against the British government or the British East India Company which during that time acted as a sovereign power as a representative of the British Crown. Q 2. What are the causes of the revolt of 1867? Answer- The discrimination that the lower cast people faced in the east Indian company army. The army practices various higher cast rituals and took measures to segregate the people based on caste. With the increasing expansion plans of the British Government, there was a scope that the power of Nawabs and Zamindars in various places will be reduced or completely taken away. Q 3. What was the impact of the revolt on the East India Company? Answer- \n",
      "The revolt of 1857 was also known as the First War of Independence. It has several different incidents and backgrounds leading to an uprising as such revolt.

      "The Revolt of 1857: Causes, Nature, Importance and OutcomesThe Revolt of 1857 was a prolonged period of armed uprising as well as rebellions in Northern and Central India against British occupation of that part of the subcontinent. Small precursors of brewing discontent involving incidences of arson in cantonment areas began to manifest themselves in January. Later, a large-scale rebellion broke out in May and turned into what may be called a full-fledged war in the affected region. This war brought about the end of the British East India Company’s rule in India, and led to the direct rule by the British Government (British Raj) of much of the Indian Subcontinent for the next 90 years. \n",

      "Doug Williams is a fictional character on the American soap opera Days of Our Lives. He has been portrayed by Bill Hayes since 1970. Since 1999, he continued to make recurring appearances as Doug, notably airing during the holiday seasons, with his final appearance being in July 2024, six months after his death on January 12, 2024. Reception For his portrayal of Doug Williams, Bill Hayes was given the Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018. Hayes was also nominated for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Actor in a Daytime Drama Series in 1975 and 1976. In 2020, Charlie Mason from Soaps She Knows placed Doug at #15 on a list of the 35 most memorable characters from Days of Our Lives, saying 'The erstwhile Brent Douglas has come a long way from his humble beginnings. The smooth-talking con man became a good guy — so good, in fact, that viewers deemed him worthy of the heroine at No. 8. [Julie Olson]'.

      "Doug & Julie Williams Douglas Williams and Julie Olson Williams are fictional characters and a supercouple from the American daytime drama Days of Our Lives. Doug and Julie are considered to be the first supercouple in daytime television history. Doug was portrayed by Bill Hayes and Julie is portrayed by Susan Seaforth Hayes. The actors were married in real life from 1974 until Hayes’ death in 2024, and appeared together in their roles that made them famous on NBC's Days of our Lives from 1970 until 2023. Cultural impact \n",
      "From the 'Look of Love' that shines in their eyes when they gaze at each other to the songs of love sung to the 'Most Beautiful Girl in the World', Doug and Julie will always be the ideal Super couple, in real life and in the reel life of Salem in the Days of Our Lives! Our wish is that someday, that love will burn bright again on the daytime screen in the town of Salem! Thank you for visiting and come back real soon! Lana and Della 49 years and the love only grows stronger! CLIP OF DOUG & JULIE'S 1st TV WEDDING FROM OCTOBER 1, 1976... here Thank you, Jason 47 and Twitter. Day of Days! Watch the interview here. News: Susan Seaforth Hayes Celebrates GRAND Milestone! from Soap Opera News We are thrilled to recognize today, one of the daytime industry's best - Susan Seaforth Hayes for her years of outstanding service to the genre. On this day in soap history in 1968, Hayes stepped into the role of Julie Williams on 'Days of Our Lives' replacing Catherine Ferrar. \n",
      "What a great 52 years it has been, such a wonderful journey and something worth remembering as we look back at the fantabulous character of Julie Olson Williams. Happy 52nd anniversary Susan! Susan (July 11, 1943) is an American dramatic actress. She is best known for her portrayal of Julie Williams on the NBC drama Days of Our Lives, and her intermittent portrayal of Joanna Manning on the CBS daytime drama The Young and the Restless. She began playing the role of Julie Olsen Williams on Days of Our Lives in 1968, and is the only actor to appear on the show for all seven decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s) in which it has been on the air. Seaforth Hayes still regularly appears on Days as Julie. For her work on Days, Seaforth Hayes has received four Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, in 1975, 1976, 1978, and 1979; and two nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, in 2018, \n",
      "Doug's real identity was orphan Brent Douglas and this helped him form a bond with Julie's mother, Addie Horton Olson (Patricia Barry). After a fight with Julie over her son, David, Doug went to Addie's and she proposed to him. He accepted and the two of them were married. In 1974 they had a daughter together, Hope. After surviving leukemia, Addie died after being struck by a car pushing Hope's carriage out of the way just in time to save her daughter. Eventually, Julie, who had married and divorced Bob Anderson, reunited and the two of them married in a beautiful ceremony in 1976. Over the next few years, Doug and Julie would face many obstacles including the loss of Doug's Place (formerly Sergio's), Julie's rape and eventual trial for the murder of her rapist, and Julie being disfigured in a fire on Maggie's farm. The latter led her to divorce Doug but the two of them remarried in 1981 after Doug ended his marriage to Lee DuMonde. \n",
      "Doug and Julie drove romantic storylines on 'Days' throughout the 70s and into the early 1980s. However, Doug then shifted to the stubborn father who was trying to keep his daughter Hope (Kristian Alfonso) from rebel Bo Brady (Peter Reckell). Doug suffered a heart attack after catching the two about to make love. Off-screen, Hayes and Reckell had a much more harmonious relationship. Reckell admired the range of Hayes’ life and career, which included serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II and starring in Broadway and touring stage musicals prior to landing his role on 'Days.' 'We had powerful moments together on the show, but what really touched me was listening to his stories,' Reckell recalled in a X post following Hayes’ passing. 'Being a pilot in the military, huge celebrations with his family, the many musicals he was in. Boundless talent, energy and spirit.' \n",
      "Hayes joined Days of Our Lives to play con artist/lounge singer Doug Williams in February 1970. Seaforth Hayes, who portrayed the spoiled heiress Julie Olsen Banning Anderson Williams, had joined the show 15 months earlier. The actors married on Oct. 12, 1974, and then their characters wed (for the first of three times!) on an episode that aired Oct. 1, 1976. They repeated their actual wedding vows for their inaugural TV ceremony. 'In 1974, Susan and I got married in my living room with 16 people,' Hayes once said. 'In 1976, when Doug and Julie got married, we had 16 million people.' Quite naturally, the televised nuptials came after Doug had married Julie’s mom (Patricia Barry), who would die a tragic death, and had a daughter with her (that would be Julie’s half-sister). He and Seaforth Hayes made history when they became the only soap stars to grace the front of Time magazine. The cover line on that Jan. 12, 1976, edition: 'Soap Operas: Sex and Suffering in the Afternoon.' Doug and Julie 'went on a cruise' and left the town of Salem as the actors departed Days of Our Lives following a dispute over storylines in 1984. They spent the next several decades on and off the show since then, with viewers always thrilled to see them return. The couple even made it to Peacock when the show shifted there in September 2022. In a 2011 interview with TV Guide, Seaforth Hayes described her husband — 18 years her senior — as 'a real lover of life, and he has taught me to have a broader horizon, which I think is probably the key to our still being deliriously happy to see each other 24 hours a day.' They received a lifetime achievement award at the Daytime Emmys in April 2018. \n",
      "The character of Julie Williams has been on DAYS OF OUR LIVES for decades, so it’s understandable if newer fans aren’t aware of her epic history on the soap! Julie Olson was introduced back in 1965 when the soap debuted, with Charla Doherty playing the teen. The role was recast twice with Catherine Dunn and Catherine Ferrar before Susan Seaforth Hayes took over in 1968. Over the decades, the actress has been nominated five times for Daytime Emmy Awards, and received the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018. Hayes also celebrated her 50th anniversary with DAYS in December of 2018. And even when things are at their darkest, Julie always seems to find a way to pull through! \n",
      "Doug and Julie continued to come and go, always being around for the important moments like saying a final farewell to Alice Horton after she passed away and helping Hope grieve the death of her husband, Bo Brady. In 2017, Julie was devastated to learn that her son, David, had been killed in a motorcycle accident, but overjoyed to find out that she has another grandson, Eli Grant. She also found herself being forced into a partnership with Chloe Lane as they reopened Doug’s Place. Julie wanted to help Abigail Deveraux prove that Gabi Hernandez had been scheming against her, but fighting with Gabi sent Julie tumbling down a flight of stairs and landed her in the hospital! Gabi learned the hard way not to mess with Julie!XJJohnson/jpistudios.com \n",

      "Who is the Real Architect of India’s Constitution, Nehru or Ambedkar? – Presidential System Skip to content Search for: Search Presidential System America's Exceptional System of Government U.S. India India Who is the Real Architect of India’s Constitution, Nehru or Ambedkar? Date: December 6, 2018Author: Bhanu Dhamija It is commonly believed that B.R. Ambedkar framed the Indian Constitution. Many think he did so single-handedly. But like any other constitution, ours wasn’t created by any single person. It was formulated in a number of Committees and then debated and decided inside the Constituent Assembly. However, there is a reason why Ambedkar is usually given all the credit. He was a popular leader of the Dalits (people of scheduled castes) who constitute about 16% of India’s population today. That is a big vote bank. For decades, those who wish to get the Dalit vote have been feigning Ambedkar-worship by singing paeans to his constitutional contributions. No doubt, Ambedkar was a key member of the Constituent Assembly. He sat in some of its topmost committees, such as the Union Constitution Committee chaired by Jawaharlal Nehru. Ambedkar also led the Drafting Committee which scrutinized the original draft prepared by the Constitutional Advisor, B.N. Rau. Shepherding the final draft through the Assembly was a major accomplishment indeed, where Ambedkar made some of his finest speeches. But the real architect of India’s Constitution was Jawaharlal Nehru. His Union Constitution Committee had 15 members including Ambedkar. Almost all key principles of the Constitution were decided by this Committee, and only then brought to the floor of the Assembly. And since the Assembly was in total control of the Congress party of which Nehru was the indisputable leader, the Committee decisions were almost always approved. So much so that in the case of deciding how the President of the country ought to be elected, Nehru’s wish prevailed over all others inside the Assembly. He wanted the President to be elected indirectly by the MPs and MLAs sitting in the country’s legislatures. In a joint meeting in June 1947 of the Assembly’s 36 topmost framers, Nehru was asked to reconsider. But he never did.  Today, India’s President, the head of government, is not elected directly by the people. In the following article, one of India’s leading constitutional scholars, Sudheendra Kulkarni chronicles the roles of Ambedkar and Nehru in the making of India’s Constitution. -Bhanu Dhamija Follow @BhanuDhamija * [Excerpts of Kulkarni’s article first published in The Herald} Nehru Stands Above Ambedkar in the Writing of India’s Constitution By Sudheendra Kulkarni \n",
      "Indeed, as the head of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution, he certainly stands tall among the luminaries who were part of the Constituent Assembly. AMBEDKAR: NOT THE SOLE ARCHITECT OF THE CONSTITUTION However, it helps to know that members of the Drafting Committee – much less its chairman – did not have the sole or overriding power to prepare the document on their own, or the way they like. They had to draft the Constitution as per the views and recommendations of various subject committees, and the draft itself was discussed, amended and ultimately adopted by the larger Constituent Assembly. In this entire process, no leader played a more pivotal role than Nehru. How could it have been otherwise? He was, after all, and after Mahatma Gandhi, the tallest leader of the freedom movement and the Congress. He was the prime minister in the interim government of India, formed on 2 September 1946. \n",
      "First, we cannot forget the significant role played by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in our freedom struggle and also, in the constitution making. In our current political climate, there are severe attempts to belittle Nehru’s contribution to India, but one cannot change history. Nehru was responsible for setting the agenda of the Constituent Assembly. On 13 December 1946, he moved the Objectives Resolution which laid down the guiding principles and objectives on which the Constitution was to be framed. The Preamble of our Constitution bares resemblance to Nehru’s Resolution. Nehru also chaired significant committees like States Committee, Union Powers Committee and Union Constitution Committee, and hence, informed the content of the provisions they recommended. He also participated in key debates and often, his position on an issue was the final word. Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel were hailed as ‘Real Architects of the Constitution’ by T.T. Krishnamachari \n",
      "Sir Benegal Narsing Rau was the first person who contributed to the Indian constitution. He was a civil servant, who went on to become the first Indian Judge in the International Court of Justice. He was appointed as the constitutional adviser in 1946, and was responsible for the determination of the general structure of the constitution. He prepared and completed the first draft in 1948, which consisted of 243 articles and 13 schedules. B.R. Ambedkar After the completion of the first draft, the constitution was handed over to a seven-member drafting committee, which was headed by Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, for further discussion and amendments. Dr Ambedkar was a jurist, economist, politician and social reformer who worked for the Bahujan community. He became the first Law and Justice Minister of Independent India and received the Bharat Ratna in 1990. Today, he is often referred to as the Father of the Indian Constitution. Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer \n",
      "Dr BR Ambedkar was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and politician and is best known as the chief architect of the Indian Constitution. He belonged to the Mahar caste which was considered untouchable in Hinduism but converted to Buddhism on October 14, 1956, in Nagpur, along with 500,000 supporters, after studying the religion for years and is not only known for his great influence in eradicating the social scourge of untouchability in India but also for having led a crusade for the upliftment and empowerment of Dalits in the country since he believed that Dalits can never get their rights within Hinduism. Now catch your favourite game on Crickit. Anytime Anywhere. Find out how \n",
      "Due to his seminal role in the framing of the Indian Constitution, Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar is popularly known all over India as the chief architect of the Indian Constitution. His efforts to eradicate social evils were remarkable and that is why he is called the 'messiah' of the Dalits and downtrodden in India. Dr Ambedkar was appointed the Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee. The text prepared by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections for a wide range of civil liberties for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability and outlawing all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and also won the Constituent Assembly’s support for introducing a system of reservations of jobs for members of the SC and ST. Ambedkar kept the clauses of the Constitution flexible so that amendments could be made as and when the situation demanded. He provided an inspiring Preamble to the Constitution ensuring justice, social, economic and political, liberty, equality and fraternity. The creation of an egalitarian social order, however, remains an unfulfilled wishful thinking to this day. \n",
      "On August 29, 1947 Dr. Ambedkar was appointed the Chairman of the Drafting Committee that was constituted by Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for independent India. The draft Constitution was the result of the collective efforts of a galaxy of great leaders and legal scholars in the Constituent Assembly such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, B.R. Ambedkar, Sardar Patel, B.N. Rao, Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyar etc. The purpose of this paper is to examine the contribution of Dr Ambedkar only to the Indian Constitution. \n",

      "\u001b[102m\"The most common mutation causing CF is a three-base pair deletion in the position of delta F508 (dF508)\" [1]\u001b[0m which \u001b[96m\"results in the omission of phenylalanine (one of the bricks) at position 508 in the 1480 amino acid chain\" [2]\u001b[0m. This mutation \u001b[92m\"causes CFTR to be folded improperly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preventing CFTR from reaching the cell membrane\" [3]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "Over one thousand different mutant alleles of CFTR have been described. Any mutation that prevents CFTR from sufficiently transporting ions can lead to cystic fibrosis (CF). Worldwide, the most common CFTR allele among CF patients is called ΔF508 (delta-F508 or PHE508DEL), which is a deletion of three nucleotides that eliminates a phenylalanine (F) from position 508 of the 1480 amino acid wild-type protein. Mutation ΔF508 causes CFTR to be folded improperly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preventing CFTR from reaching the cell membrane. The allele ΔF508 accounts for approximately 70% of CF cases in North America, with ~1/25 people of European descent being carriers. The high frequency of the ΔF508 allele around the world has led to speculation that it may confer some selective advantage to heterozygotes, perhaps by reducing dehydration during cholera epidemics or by reducing susceptibility to certain pathogens that bind to epithelial membranes, although little data has been uncovered to support these hypotheses. However, recent mining of health data and genetic data from over 19,000 CFTR mutant allele heterozygotes suggests that heterozygotes exhibit an increased incidence of a variety of conditions including infertility, pancreatitis, diabetes, short stature, failure to thrive, constipation and scoliosis (Miller et al., 2020). \n",
      "The most common mutation worldwide is delta F508, which occurs in 75% of patients with CF in the UK. A three base-pair deletion in exon 10 of the CFTR gene results in the omission of phenylalanine (one of the bricks) at position 508 in the 1480 amino acid chain. A mutant CFTR protein which cannot be folded into its proper shape is produced. The quality control mechanisms within the cell destroy this abnormal protein before it can reach the cell surface where its major normal function is to act as a channel through which chloride ions can pass in and out of the cell. In other ethnic groups the range of mutations are different e.g. in Ashkenazi Jews delta F508 accounts for 27% and W1282X for 51% of the mutations (Kalman et al, 1994). Mode of inheritance and risk of passing on the CF gene \n",
      "The commonest polymorphism is the seven thymidine (7T) variant and the delta F508 mutation occurs exclusively on the 9T variant. This variation may be important in some CFTR mutations e.g. R117H. The presence of R117H/delta F508 on a background of 5T is associated with an elevated sweat test and clinical CF. R117H in association with 7T may result in normal, borderline or elevated sweat values and a variable clinical presentation (Kiesewetter et al, 1993; Rave-Harel et al, 1997; Massie et al, 2001; Peckham et al, 2006). Genotyping \n",
      "The CFTR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position q31.2 [9]. To date, over 1,900 sequence variations in the CFTR gene have been reported [10], although a detailed understanding of how CFTR mutations impact channel dysfunction is limited to a only a few of these [11]. This implies a relatively small list of well-defined CFTR mutations known to be CF disease causing, whereas the functional consequence of various rare sequence variations remains unknown or has been shown not to be CF disease causing [12]. The majority of identified CFTR gene mutations fall into one of six classes that account for ∼80% of all CF patients [9]. Of the >1,900 CFTR mutations that have been identified so far, approximately only 20 mutations have a frequency >0.1% [9]. In fact, notwithstanding the common F508del variant, only four CFTR mutations have a frequency >0.1%: G551D, W1282X, G542X and N1303K, having a worldwide prevalence of around 1–3% each [9, 11]. F508del is the most common mutation with an allelic frequency of around 90% worldwide [13]. Mutation classification Class I and II CFTR mutations are typically characterised by a reduction in the quantity of expressed CFTR protein (fig. 1). Class I mutations can result from nonsense and frame-shift mutations, as well as mRNA splicing defects [14]. For example, G542X is a nonsense or stop mutation, where introduction of a premature termination codon (or stop codon) results in premature cessation of translation and production of truncated CFTR protein. Class II mutations, including F508del, have folding or maturation defects, which can result in premature CFTR degradation (fig. 1) [9]. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1. \n",
      "The most common mutation causing CF is a three-base pair deletion in the position of delta F508 (dF508), but there are now over 1800 mutations identified in the CFTR gene. The identification of increased immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in the blood of infants with CF has made neonatal screening for CF possible. Trypsinogen is one of the secretory products of the pancreas making its level in the blood a specific marker of pancreatic function. Detection of high levels of IRT in the newborn period place the infant at risk for CF.  Although there is no cure, newborns screened for cystic fibrosis can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment, which can: Improve growth Improve lung function Reduce hospital stays Add years to life \n",
      "The three mutations we studied affect approximately 1.5% of individuals with CF and do not disrupt the classical canonical splicing regions [20], rather they cause CF by creating strong alternative splice sites which result in formation of pseudoexons or extend existing exons in CFTR. The first mutation, c.1679+1634A>G, creates a very strong splice acceptor in intron 12 of CFTR with 99% of transcripts containing a 49bp pseudoexon with an in-frame TAA stop codon in the pseudoexon causing premature termination of the CFTR protein [21], and is classified as a severe CF-causing mutation. The second, c.3140-26A>G, creates a splice acceptor site 26 bp before exon 20 and therefore extends this exon by 25bp [22]. The resultant frameshift leads to premature termination of CFTR at a TGA stop codon. Whilst c.3140-26A>G disrupts 95% of CFTR transcripts, the production of ~5% normal transcripts is thought to explain the milder CF phenotype observed in individuals with this mutation. The final mutation, c.3718-2477C>T, creates a splice donor deep within intron 22 and leads to inclusion of an 84 bp pseudoexon (which contains an in-frame TAA stop codon) into the mRNA [23]. For individuals with c.3718-2477C>T, the 10th most common CF allele [5], a wide range of aberrant splicing has been reported, with a strong correlation between the level of mis-splicing and severity of disease [24–26]. \n",
      "The common delta F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interferes with the biosynthetic folding of nascent CFTR polypeptides, leading to their retention and rapid degradation in an intracellular compartment proximal to the Golgi apparatus. Neither the pathway by which wild-type CFTR folds nor the mechanism by which the Phe508 deletion interferes with this process is well understood. We have investigated the effect of glycerol, a polyhydric alcohol known to stabilize protein conformation, on the folding of CFTR and delta F508 in vivo. Incubation of transient and stable delta F508 transfectants with 10% glycerol induced a significant accumulation of delta F508 protein bearing complex N-linked oligosaccharides, indicative of their transit to a compartment distal to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This accumulation was accompanied by an increase in mean whole cell cAMP activated chloride conductance, suggesting that the glycerol-rescued delta F508 polypeptides form functional plasma membrane CFTR channels. These effects were dose- and time-dependent and fully reversible. Glycerol treatment also stabilized immature (core-glycosylated) delta F508 and CFTR molecules that are normally degraded rapidly. These effects of glycerol were not due to a general disruption of ER quality control processes but appeared to correlate with the degree of temperature sensitivity of specific CFTR mutations. These data suggest a model in which glycerol serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and subsequent release from the ER quality control apparatus. \n",
      "Not only is there heterogeneity in the mutations causing Cystic Fibrosis, but the pathogenetic mechanisms also vary. Deletion of phenylalanine-508 appears to cause disease by abrogating normal biosynthetic processing and thereby resulting in retention and degradation of the mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations, such as the relatively common G551D mutation [4], appear to be normally processed and, therefore, must cause disease through some other mechanism. G551D mutation, which is within the first nucleotide-binding fold of the CFTR, is the third most common CF mutation, with a worldwide frequency of 3.1% among CF chromosomes [5]. Several mutations result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced [6]. \n",
      "The most common CF mutation, F508del, is primarily considered to be a processing mutation. The F508del mutation removes a single amino acid from the CFTR protein. Without this building block, the CFTR protein cannot stay in the correct 3-D shape. The cell recognizes that the protein isn't the right shape and disposes of it. The drug combination Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) works by enabling CFTR protein with an F508del mutation to fold in a more correct shape, and then activates the protein to allow more chloride to pass through. Although this drug combination is not a perfect fix, it helps the mutant CFTR protein to move some chloride. This movement of chloride reduces the symptoms of CF. Watch the webcast (starting at 3:02) to learn more about CF protein processing mutations and how drugs such as CFTR modulators can help a person with one of these mutations. \n",

      "\n",
      "A director's cut is \u001b[95m\"a version of a film that represents the director's own approved edit\" [1]\u001b[0m. It may include \u001b[95m\"scenes that were not in the theatrical cut of the movie, which was altered by the studio for time or content\" [2]\u001b[0m.

      "Director's cuts of film are not generally released to the public because on most films the director does not have the final cut privilege. Those with money invested in the film, such as the production companies, distributors, or studios, may make changes intended to make the film more profitable at the box office. This sometimes means a happier ending or less ambiguity, or excluding scenes that would earn a more audience-restricting rating, but more often means that the film is simply shortened to provide more screenings per day. With the rise of home video, the phrase became more generically used as a marketing term (including media such as comic books and music albums, neither of which actually have directors), and the most commonly seen form of director's cut is a cut where extra scenes and characters are added in, often making the director's cut considerably longer than the final cut. Origin of the phrase Traditionally, the 'director's cut' is not, by definition, the director's ideal or preferred cut. The editing process of a film is broken into stages: First is the assembly/rough cut, where all selected takes are put together in the order in which they should appear in the film. Next, the editor's cut is reduced from the rough cut; the editor may be guided by their own choices or following notes from the director or producers. Eventually is the final cut, which actually gets released or broadcast. In between the editor's cut and the final cut can come any number of fine cuts, including the director's cut. The director's cut may include unsatisfactory takes, a preliminary soundtrack, a lack of desired pick-up shots etc., which the director would not like to be shown but uses as a placeholder until satisfactory replacements can be inserted. This is still how the term is used within the film industry, as well as commercials, television, and music videos. Inception The trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the 'director's cut' of The Wild Bunch was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences. The theatrical release of the film had cut 10 minutes to get an R rating, but this cut was hailed as superior and has now become the definitive one. Other early examples include George Lucas's first two films being re-released following the success of Star Wars, in cuts which more closely resembled his vision, or Peter Bogdanovich re-cutting The Last Picture Show several times. Charlie Chaplin also re-released all of his films in the 1970s, several of which were re-cut (Chaplin's re-release of The Gold Rush in the 1940s is almost certainly the earliest prominent example of a director's re-cut film being released to the public). A theatrical re-release of Close Encounters of the Third Kind used the phrase 'Special Edition' to describe a cut which was closer to Spielberg's intent but had a compromised ending demanded by the studio. As the home video industry rose in the early 1980s, video releases of director's cuts were sometimes created for the small but dedicated cult fan market. Los Angeles cable station Z Channel is also cited as significant in the popularization of alternate cuts. Early examples of films released in this manner include Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, where a longer cut was recalled from theatres but subsequently shown on cable and eventually released to home video; James Cameron's Aliens, where a video release restored 20 minutes the studio had insisted on cutting; Cameron also voluntarily made cuts to the theatrical version of The Abyss for pacing but restored them for a video release, and most famously, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, where an alternate workprint version was released to fan acclaim, ultimately resulting in the 1992 recut. Scott later recut the film once more, releasing a version dubbed 'The Final Cut' in 2007. This was the final re-cut and the first in which Scott maintained creative control over the final product, leading to The Final Cut being considered the definitive version of the film. \n",
      "Separate to director's cuts are alternate cuts released as 'special editions' or 'extended cuts'. These versions are often put together for home video for fans, and should not be confused with 'director's cuts'. For example, despite releasing extended versions of his The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson told IGN in 2019 that 'the theatrical versions are the definitive versions, I regard the extended cuts as being a novelty for the fans that really want to see the extra material.' 'The traditional definition of the term 'Director's Cut' suggests the restoration of a director's original vision, free of any creative limitations. It suggests that the filmmaker has finally overcome the interference of heavy-handed studio executives, and that the film has been restored to its original, untampered form. Such is not the case with Alien: The Director's Cut. It's a completely different beast.' —Ridley Scott \n",
      "Making a movie is no easy feat. You go in with the best intentions, but the more money you spend on the movie, the more people you have to answer to. If you're working for a studio or a lot of independent producers, chances are you'll have to compromise your vision. Unless you are entitled to make a director's cut. Final cut on a movie means that no matter what, the director gets to say what is released. Very few people in Hollywood have this. Most times, the studio will release their version, and then much later either on Blu-ray or digital, the director will release their version. That's where the director's cut comes into play. But what is the definition of a director's cut? And how does it happen in Hollywood? Today we're going to define that term, look at a few examples, and talk about how directors get their vision to the audience. 'Aliens'Credit: 20th Century Fox What Is a Director's Cut? (Definition and Examples) These are important terms to know if you want to work in Hollywood. Let's dig deep into definitions before we get into the examples. Director's Cut Definition A director's cut is a version of a film that represents the director's own approved edit. A director's cut may include scenes that were not in the theatrical cut of the movie, which was altered by the studio for time or content. What Does the Director’s Cut Mean? It means that this version of a film has been edited in exact accordance with the director's wishes. They have decided on the order of scenes, cuts, and length, without any interference from producers or studios. Maybe scenes that got cut from the theatrical release get added back to the director's cut. Where did Director's Cut come from? According to Wikipedia, 'The trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the 'director's cut' of The Wild Bunch was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences.' It evolved from there with directors and studios battling it out over the decades. What Is Final Cut? Final cut means that a director takes on a project knowing they will be allowed to release the director's cut to the public without interference. If a director has a final cut, there can be no fight with the studio over what goes into the movie. Only their say matters. Credit: Warner Bros. What Is the Difference Between a Theatrical Cut and Director's Cut? The theatrical cut of a movie is what the studio has decided to release to theaters. Sometimes, but not every time, the producers or studio will create their own edit to change a director's vision. They may cut out sex, violence, or just trim movies for time, so they can show more often. The director's cut means that the director chose what cut is on the screen. What's Different Between the Director's Cut and the Extended Cut? An extended cut of a movie might add scenes cut for rating or time. They are often released by the studio to capitalize on a big title, like a comedy, where more outrageous scenes could be added. If the director wanted them added in, then they would be in the director's cut. Lots of times, extended cuts are made without the director, unless specifically advertised. Something like The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition was made with director Peter Jackson, and it bridges the gap between extended and director's cut. Credit: New Line CinemaDirector's Cut Examples There are lots of examples of director's cuts out there. One that comes to mind immediately is that of Blade Runner, which Ridley Scott famously keeps releasing director's cuts of, as he goes back and tweaks voiceover, dream sequences, and lots of other nuances. Scott also released a far superior director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven, which turned the average film into a masterpiece. \n",

In some cases, such as Ridley Scott’s Kingdom of Heaven, a substantial amount of footage was added, which garnered it critical acclaim as one of the best Director’s Cuts of all time. \n",

      "Anna Maria Magnani (7 March 1908 – 26 September 1973) was an Italian stage and film actress. Widely regarded as one of the greatest actresses of Italian and World cinema, she was known for her explosive acting and earthy, real life portrayals of characters. Born in Rome, she worked her way through Rome's Academy of Dramatic Art by singing at night clubs. During her career, her only child was stricken by polio when he was 18 months old and remained crippled. She was referred to as 'La Lupa,' the 'perennial toast of Rome' and a 'living she-wolf symbol' of the cinema. 'Time' magazine described her personality as 'fiery', and drama critic Harold Clurman said her acting was 'volcanic'. In the realm of Italian cinema she was 'passionate, fearless, and exciting,' an actress that film historian Barry Monush calls 'the volcanic earth mother of all Italian cinema.' Director Roberto Rossellini called her 'the greatest acting genius since Eleonora Duse'. Playwright Tennessee Williams became an admirer of her acting and wrote 'The Rose Tattoo' specifically for her to star in, a role for which she received an Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Italian ever to win an Oscar. After meeting director Goffredo Alessandrini she received her first screen role in 'La cieca di SorrentoThe Blind Woman of Sorrento') (1934) and later achieved international fame in Rossellini's 'Rome, Open City' (1945) , considered the first significant movie to launch the Italian neorealism movement in cinema. As an actress she became recognized for her dynamic and forceful portrayals of 'earthy lower-class women' in such films as 'L'Amore' (1948), 'Bellissima' (1951), 'The Rose Tattoo' (1955), 'The Fugitive Kind' (1960) and 'Mamma Roma' (1962). As early as 1950 'Life' magazine had already stated that Magnani was 'one of the most impressive actresses since Garbo'. \n",

It was directed by Vincente Minnelli and produced by Pandro S. Berman, from a screenplay by Robert Ardrey based on the Flaubert novel. The music score was by Miklós Rózsa, the cinematography by Robert H. Planck and the art direction by Cedric Gibbons and Jack Martin Smith.

      "Hiram 'Hank' Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation 'for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.' \n",

      "James Searle Dawley (May 13, 1877 – March 30, 1949) was an American producer, director and screenwriter. He directed 149 silent films between 1907 and 1926. He was born in Del Norte, Colorado, and died in Hollywood, California. Searley is best remembered for directing the Thomas Edison version of 'Frankenstein' in 1910. He reportedly referred to himself as 'the first motion picture director', which was not accurate. He worked for a while at Edison's studio, then started his own production company, being quite successful financially, although most of his films are little known today. When critics began to regard the films of his day to be immoral, Searley became one of the founding members of the MPDA (Motion Picture Directors Association) which sought to give filmmakers who advocated good taste the power of self-censorship. \n",

The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia. Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The empire's capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain. Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga (modern Odisha), which he conquered in about 260 BCE. In about 263 BCE, he converted to Buddhism after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War, which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations. He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia, and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha. Beyond the Edicts of Ashoka, biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later, such as the 2nd-century CE 'Ashokavadana'Narrative of Ashoka, a part of the 'Divyavadana'), and in the Sri Lankan text 'Mahavamsa'Great Chronicle). The emblem of the modern Republic of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka. His Sanskrit name  means 'painless, without sorrow' (the 'a' privativum and 'śokapain, distress'). In his edicts, he is referred to as ' (Pali ' or 'the Beloved of the Gods'), and ' (Pali ' or 'He who regards everyone with affection'). His fondness for his name's connection to the 'Saraca asoca' tree, or 'Ashoka tree', is also referenced in the 'Ashokavadana'. In 'The Outline of History' (1920), H.G. Wells wrote, 'Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Ashoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star.' \n",

Your pancreas makes enzymes that help break down the foods you eat so you can get nutrients, vitamins, and minerals from them. When you have EPI, your pancreas doesn't make enough of these enzymes. To help you digest foods more easily, you can get treatments that replace them. Other treatments help you manage symptoms like stomach pain or acid. Supplements can give your body extra doses of important vitamins and minerals to keep your weight up so you stay healthy. You also can treat the health problem that causes your EPI, like cystic fibrosis, Shwachman- Diamond syndrome, or chronic pancreatitis. You may get chronic pancreatitis if you have alcoholism or pancreatic stones.

PERTs can help you better absorb fats from your foods, ease symptoms like stomach upset or oily stools, and just help you feel better overall. There are several prescription enzymes. If your doctor prescribes this medication, take it at the start of meals or before you eat snacks, along with a liquid like water. Don't dissolve the pill in a liquid like milk or take it with any over-the-counter stomach acid medicine that has calcium or magnesium. These products can break down the coating and enzymes in your pills. The amount you take depends on your body weight. You'll start with the lowest possible dosage and take more if you need it. You may also take drugs to lower stomach acid along with your PERT. Your doctor can prescribe these, and they're also available over the counter: Proton pump inhibitors like esomeprazole ( Nexium) or omeprazole H2 blockers like cimetidine ( Tagamet, Topcare), famotidine, or ranitidine Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can help you manage pain. Emotional stress can also trigger pancreas inflammation. Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline ( Pamelor) may help ease pain. Gabapentin ( Neurontin, Gralise),, a drug that helps control seizures, can also help fight EPI pain. Pregabalin ( Lyrica), which is used to treat seizures and nerve pain, also shows promise. EPI makes it hard for you to get the right nutrients because your body can't break down your foods. You might not get enough vitamin A, B12, D, E, and K, and you probably don't take in enough fats. Your doctor can prescribe vitamin supplements to help you get the right levels of these nutrients. She can also tell you which over-the-counter supplements and dosage to take. It's better for you to eat small meals more often than big ones that are hard to digest. Low fat may be easier on your system if you have a severe case. But if not, make sure you get enough calories and fats to help you stay at a healthy weight. Talk to a dietitian or nutritionist to help you choose the right foods or create meal plans. If you smoke or drink, it's time to stop. Alcohol and tobacco both make it harder for your pancreas to work. Alcoholism is one possible cause of EPI. Smoking can lead to calcium buildup in your pancreas. Cystic fibrosis. Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, antibiotics, laxatives, and enemas. You can also eat a high-calorie, high-fat diet or take supplements to get the nutrition you need. If you have cystic fibrosis and EPI, you may also get diabetes. Keep your blood sugar levels under control, and take insulin or other medications if your doctor prescribes them. Shwachman- Diamond syndrome. Your doctor may prescribe PERTs, a high-fat and high-calorie diet, and vitamins and supplements. Scientists are also working to see if stem cell transplants will treat this genetic disease. Chronic pancreatitis: If you have alcoholic pancreatitis, it's important to stop drinking. You may need to enter a treatment program or work with a counselor to stop. If you smoke, stop. If there are stones blocking your ducts, the doctor can remove them. If you have a systemic illness like lupus or cystic fibrosis, treatment for the underlying condition may help the chronic pancreatitis. Yes. Surgery can open ducts that are clogged or blocked by gallstones, and decompression can widen a main pancreatic duct that's too narrow. Another option is to remove your pancreas and give you an autologous islet cell transplant. These are cells from your own body that make insulin. The doctor will get them into your body through a vein in your liver. This surgery can ease severe chronic pancreatitis pain or prevent or ease diabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis. But it's only used if other treatments haven't worked. If other treatments fail, the doctor might remove a portion of your pancreas, but this is usually a last resort.\n",

      "\n",
      "For individuals with psoriasis, it is recommended to \u001b[92m\"use a moisturizing body wash so you don't have apply moisturizer again when you get out of the shower\" [1]\u001b[0m. Additionally, choosing \u001b[92m\"easy-to-use products\" [2]\u001b[0m is advised, such as switching \u001b[92m\"to powder\" [3]\u001b[0m for makeup, using \u001b[92m\"extra-wide lip-gloss tubes and makeup pencils\" [4]\u001b[0m, and opting for \u001b[92m\"Hairbrushes with longer handles\" [5]\u001b[0m. However, the provided sources do not specify which ingredients should be avoided in grooming products by individuals with psoriasis.\n",
      "Psoriasis can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in your joints. The combination of skin flare-ups and joint pain is known as psoriatic arthritis. If you're not sure if you have it, talk to your doctor. Psoriatic arthritis usually hits joints like your knees, fingers, toes, and back. When you get flare-ups there, it may be tough to do everyday tasks. But you can still look your best. These tips and tricks can make your self-care routine easier and more enjoyable: 1. Start with a warm shower. Heat boosts blood flow. That can help ease stiff, painful joints. You may feel less sore and more flexible if you shower before starting your day. If you have psoriasis plaques on your skin, don't take a super long or hot shower. That can make skin flare-ups worse. 2. Get comfortable. As you get ready to do your hair and makeup, think about how you're feeling. For example, if your hips or knees hurt, try sitting down in front of a mirror rather than standing in front of a sink vanity. 3. Give yourself time. If you're rushing, you're more likely to move in ways that cause more pain. Build in extra time in the morning so you can move at a speed that feels good. 4. But look for shortcuts. If you blow-dry your hair, towel or air-dry it as long as possible so you don't have to hold the blow dryer as long. In the shower, use a moisturizing body wash so you don't have apply moisturizer again when you get out of the shower. 5. Choose easy-to-use products. If you have trouble applying liquid foundation, think about a switch to powder. You can put it on with a wide-handled makeup brush. Get extra-wide lip-gloss tubes and makeup pencils. Hairbrushes with longer handles can make it easier to reach the back of your head. 6. What about an occupational therapist? If you have severe joint pain and a limited range of motion, one can come to your house and make suggestions on how to make everyday activities easier, like your beauty routine. It's often covered by insurance, too.\n",

      "How do I recover from abdominal surgery to prevent inguinal hernia?\n",
      "\n",
      "After abdominal surgery, to prevent inguinal hernia, it's crucial to \u001b[92m\"be careful afterward: Use your legs, not your back, when lifting\" [1]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"Avoid lifting heavy things\" [2]\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m\"Try not to strain when you poop\" [3]\u001b[0m. To strengthen the abdominal area post-surgery, although specific exercises are not mentioned, following general advice on physical activity and avoiding strain can be inferred as beneficial. The signs of inguinal hernia to watch out for include: \u001b[92m\"Hurt when you cough, bend, or lift something heavy\" [4]\u001b[0m, \u001b[92m\"Feel pressure or weakness in your groin\" [5]\u001b[0m, and \u001b[92m\"Have swelling around your testicles\" [6]\u001b[0m. To aid in the recovery process post-abdominal surgery, adopting a diet that \u001b[92m\"may help you avoid constipation\" [7]\u001b[0m is recommended, which includes \u001b[92m\"a high-fiber diet with plenty of veggies, fresh fruits, and whole grains\" [8]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "If you feel a pain in your groin when you cough or lift something heavy, you may have what doctors call an inguinal hernia. It happens when a part of the small intestine or fat pushes through a weak area of your lower abdominal wall. This type of hernia is named for the inguinal canal. That's a passage in the lower abdominal wall that houses blood vessels and nerves, as well as the spermatic cord in boys and men, and ligaments that support the uterus in girls and women. An inguinal hernia could be a serious health problem, so you shouldn't ignore symptoms. A physical exam is usually all it takes to diagnose the problem. If the hernia is large enough, you'll need surgery to fix it. A baby can get an indirect inguinal hernia if the lining of their abdomen doesn't fully close while they're developing. What's left is an opening at the upper part of the inguinal canal. That's where a hernia can take shape. Older adults usually get a direct inguinal hernia because the muscles of their abdominal wall can weaken. Women rarely have this type of hernia. The broad ligament of the uterus is right behind the abdominal wall, which supports it and shields the inguinal canal. Men don't have that barrier, so stress and gradual weakening of their abdominal muscles over time make it more likely something can push through to the inguinal canal. It happens in 2% to 3% of male babies, but less than 1% of baby girls. About 1 in 4 males will have one at some time in their life. It's most common in men over the age of 40. Abdominal surgery can make you more likely to develop a direct inguinal hernia. A family history of this condition raises your odds, too. Smokers may have a higher chance of having inguinal hernias, as well as many other health problems. You can't prevent being born with a weaker abdominal wall. But you can take steps to avoid having problems because of it, such as not smoking and keeping your weight in check. If you have abdominal surgery, be careful afterward: Use your legs, not your back, when lifting. Avoid lifting heavy things. Try not to strain when you poop. You could have a direct inguinal hernia if you: Hurt when you cough, bend, or lift something heavy Feel pressure or weakness in your groin Have swelling around your testicles You may be able to gently push the bump back up into your abdomen to relieve some of the discomfort. See your doctor if you have symptoms of an inguinal hernia. Your doctor will check your groin area for swelling or a bulge. He'll probably ask you to stand and cough. This can make a hernia more obvious. If it hasn't produced any swelling that the doctor can see, he may order imaging tests, like an abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. In some cases, if your hernia isn't treated, you could develop a serious complication called \"strangulation.\" It happens when the small intestine gets stuck in the inguinal canal and can't be moved or massaged back into the abdomen. As a result of being \"strangled,\" the intestines lose their blood supply. The affected part of the intestines can die. This is a major medical emergency. If you have an inguinal hernia and your belly hurts a lot, don't wait -- call 911. If you have an inguinal hernia, a high-fiber diet with plenty of veggies, fresh fruits, and whole grains may help you avoid constipation, which can lead to painful symptoms. Surgery can prevent strangulation, and it's the only way to fix an inguinal hernia. The doctor will push the bulging tissue back inside and strengthen your abdominal wall with stitches and perhaps mesh. She might be able to do this through a small cut in your belly using a special tool -- a procedure called laparoscopy -- which means you'll probably hurt less and heal faster than traditional surgery. An inguinal hernia can be quite painful, but it's definitely treatable. If you think you have one, see your doctor. It won't get better on its own.\n",

You make countless trips to the bathroom, and still you feel like you have to go again. And once you're in there, instead of mindlessly going about your business, you feel burning or stinging every time you pee. When you get a bladder infection, it leads to cystitis, which is when your bladder swells and gets irritated. That's what causes the symptoms. A bladder infection is the most common type of urinary tract infection ( UTI). Here are the parts of your urinary tract and what they do: Your kidneysclean waste from your blood and make pee. Your ureters are thin tubes, one for each kidney, that carry pee to your bladder. Your bladder stores pee. Your urethra carries pee from the bladder to outside your body. Women get bladder infections much more than men do. Usually, the infections are more annoying than they are serious, and antibiotics are the treatment. But they can travel up the ureters to the kidneys and cause more severe problems, so it's important to treat them right away. The main culprits are bacteria, usually E. coli. These bacteria live on your skin and in your intestines and most of the time, they're not a problem. Everyone has them. But if they get into the urethra, they can end up in the bladder and cause an infection. Bladder infections are more common in women than men for several reasons. A woman's urethra is shorter than a man's, and it's close to the vagina and anus, where bacteria live. Having sex, wiping from back to front after you go to the bathroom, putting in a tampon, and using a diaphragm for birth control are all ways bacteria can get in. During pregnancy, the baby can press on your bladder, which prevents it from emptying completely and gives bacteria a place to thrive. After menopause, women have less of the hormone estrogen. That causes the lining of the urethra to get thinner and may change the balance of bacteria in the vagina, making infections more likely. When men get them, a prostate infection usually is the cause. But any blockage -- like from a bladder stone or enlarged prostate -- can prevent the bladder from totally emptying and cause infection.\n",

      "\n",
      "Limiting the sounds in your life can help prevent hearing loss by avoiding \u001b[92m\"noise-induced hearing loss\" [1]\u001b[0m which is \u001b[92m\"a result of the loudness of sounds and how long you hear them\" [2]\u001b[0m.

      "Many adults eventually realize they're pressing the âvolume upâ button on the TV remote more often, or that a lot of people around them need to speak up. There are two common reasons people start to lose their hearing: Age: As you get older, the tiny hair cells in your inner ears slowly break down and can't pick up sound vibrations as well as they used to. Noise: A lot of loud sound over time can damage the hair cells in your ears. The good news? You can do some things to avoid noise-induced hearing loss and keep age-related hearing loss from getting worse. Here are eight tips to help keep your ears as sharp as possible. How loud is too loud? If you have to shout over the noise around you, it's loud enough to damage your hearing. Sounds from motorcycles, concert speakers, power tools like saws and drills, earphones, and more are all loud enough to make a difference. Think about buying appliances and devices that have low noise ratings. And if it's too loud in the movie theater, restaurant, or any other place you go often, ask the manager to turn it down. Sometimes you can't avoid the blare of an ambulance siren or the jackhammer on your street corner. But it's best to limit the amount of time you're around them. Noise-induced hearing loss is a result of the loudness of sounds and how long you hear them. If you know you're going to be around loud sounds for more than a few minutes, think about wearing protection, such as: Earplugs. Usually made of foam or rubber, they go in your ear canal and can reduce noise by 15 to 30 decibels. You can buy them off-the-shelf or have them custom-made to fit you. Some earplugs lower noise levels evenly across all frequencies. They're useful for people who need to make sound quieter but undistorted, such as musicians. Earmuffs. These fit completely over your ears and reduce sounds by about 15 to 30 decibels. They have to fit tightly over both ears to block sound. You can also wear earplugs and earmuffs together for even greater protection. Tobacco can make you more likely to lose your hearing, too, research shows. So if you light up, that's one more good reason to quit. If you aren't a smoker, avoid breathing secondhand smoke. A buildup of wax in your ears can muffle sound. But don't use a cotton swab to clean them out -- they can push wax deeper in. Instead, use an at-home irrigation kit to soften wax and gently wash it out. If it gets compacted in your ear, your doctor may need to remove it. About 200 drugs can damage hearing, including some antibiotics and cancer-fighting drugs. Even high doses of aspirin can harm your ears. If you take a prescription medication, check with your doctor to make sure it won't make an impact. If you must take a medication that may harm your ears, make sure your doctor checks your hearing and balance before and during your treatment. Make an appointment to get a hearing test if you: Have close relatives with hearing loss Have trouble hearing conversations Are around loud noises on a regular basis Often hear ringing in your ears If you have some hearing loss, you can avoid getting more damage by steering clear of loud noises. If your problem is severe enough, think about a hearing aid or other treatment. Be sure to see your doctor if you have a sudden change in what you can hear that you can't explain. It could be a symptom of other serious medical problems.\n",

      "Ah, the joys of summer: The withering heat and school vacations, when your kids give you minute-to-minute updates on their boredom levels. Isn't summer supposed to be fun and relaxing? If you've got summer depression, it isn't. For some people, summer depression has a biological cause, says Ian A. Cook, MD, the director of the Depression Research Program at UCLA. For others, the particular stresses of summer can pile up and make them feel miserable. Especially hard is that you feel like you're supposed to be having a great time. Everyone else seems so happy splashing in the water and sweating in their lawn chairs. So why can't you? And more importantly, what can you do to make this summer easier? Here's what you need to know about summer depression. Why do some people feel more depressed in summer? Here's a rundown of reasons. \u001b[92m[1] Summertime SAD\u001b[0m. You've probably heard about seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, which \u001b[92m[2] affects about 4% to 6% of the U. S. population\u001b[0m. SAD typically causes depression as the days get shorter and colder. But about 10% of people with SAD get it in the reverse -- \u001b[92m[3] the onset of summer triggers their depression symptoms\u001b[0m. Cook notes that some studies have shown that in countries near the equator â such as India â summer SAD is more common than winter SAD. Why do seasonal changes cause depression? Experts aren't sure, but \u001b[92m[4] the longer days, and increasing heat and humidity\u001b[0m may play a role. Specific symptoms of summer depression often include loss of appetite, trouble \u001b[92m[11] sleep\u001b[0ming, weight loss, and anxiety. \u001b[92m[5] Disrupted schedules in summer\u001b[0m. If you've had depression before, you probably know that having a reliable routine is often key to staving off symptoms. But during the summer, routine goes out the window â and that disruption can be stressful, Cook says. If you have children in grade school, you're suddenly faced with the prospect of keeping them occupied all day, every day. If your kids are in college, you may suddenly find them â and all their boxes of stuff â back in the house after a nine-month absence. Vacations can disrupt your work, \u001b[92m[11] sleep\u001b[0m, and eating habits â all of which can all contribute to summer depression. \u001b[92m[6] Body image issues\u001b[0m. As the temperature climbs and the layers of clothing fall away, a lot of people feel terribly self-conscious about their bodies, says Cook. Feeling embarrassed in shorts or a bathing suit can make life awkward, not to mention hot. Since so many summertime gatherings revolve around beaches and pools, some people start avoiding social situations out of embarrassment. \u001b[92m[7] Financial worries\u001b[0m. Summers can be expensive. There's the vacation, of course. And if you're a working parent, you may have to fork over a lot of money to summer camps or babysitters to keep your kids occupied while you're on the job. The expenses can add to a feeling of summer depression. â This summer, we have worries about the economic crisis layered on top of everything else,â says Cook. â People are feeling more financially strapped. They're wondering, â If I go on vacation, will the job still be there when I get back? 'â \u001b[92m[8] The heat\u001b[0m. Lots of people relish the sweltering heat. They love baking on a beach all day. But for the people who don't, summer heat can become truly oppressive. You may start spending every weekend hiding out in your air-conditioned bedroom, watching Pay- Per- View until your eyes ache. You may begin to skip your usual before-dinner walks because of the humidity. You may rely on unhealthy takeout because it's just too stifling to cook. Any of these things can contribute to summer depression. What can help you feel better? What can you do to make this summer different? Here are some tips on taking control of summer depression. \u001b[92m[9] Get help\u001b[0m. It's simple. If you think you're getting depressed, no matter what time of year, get help. Talk to a therapist, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Or see your general medical doctor or a psychiatrist who can evaluate whether medicines for depression might be appropriate. Never take the signs of depression lightly. Don't wait them out, assuming they'll resolve. Sometimes, what started as summer depression can turn into a longer-lasting bout of major depression, Cook tells Web MD. And even if your depression will resolve in September, that's no reason to ignore it in June. We're talking about three months of potentially avoidable misery. â A temporary depression can still be pretty awful,â says Cook. While the symptoms lift in a few months, the impact on your family and job can be permanent. \u001b[92m[10] Plan ahead\u001b[0m. Cook says there's one advantage to a summer depression: you know when it's coming. June is right there on the calendar. So if you're feeling OK in the spring, think about the specific aspects of your life that become difficult during the summer. What will help prevent summer depression? What's the best way to take time off from work? Would signing up the kids for summer programs or camp help relieve your stress? You'll feel a lot more in control heading into the summer if you have plans in place. Sleep. Vacations, summer barbecues, the short nights â they can all encourage you to stay up later than usual. But not getting enough \u001b[92m[11] sleep\u001b[0m is a common trigger for depression. So make a concerted effort to get to bed on time. \u001b[92m[12] Keep up with your exercise\u001b[0m. Many studies have found that regular physical activity can help keep depression at bay. So even if it's getting too hot for your normal activities, find other ways to stay active and head off summer depression. \u001b[92m[14] Start earlier in the morning or later in the evening, when it's not so hot\u001b[0m. Consider \u001b[92m[15] fitness equipment for the cool basement\u001b[0m. If an annual membership to a gym is too expensive, consider joining one for a couple of months just to get you through the summer. \u001b[92m[13] Don't overdo dieting and fitness\u001b[0m. Don't kick off the summer with a frenzy of dieting and exercise in order to fit into last year's bathing suit. It's bound to make you unhappy and anxious. Instead, exercise sensibly and eat moderately. If you try an insanely restrictive diet, you probably won't be able to keep it up. And that âfailureâ will just leave you more demoralized and worsen your summer depression. Protect yourself. Don't let obligations drag you down. Maybe you always host the enormous family barbecue on Memorial Day or the July 4 picnic. But if you're feeling overwhelmed, give it a pass this year. Ask another relative to host. Don't risk pushing yourself into a summer depression just to live up to tradition. Think about why. If you struggle with summer depression year after year, ask yourself if there's a reason. Do you associate summer with a difficult time in the past â the death of a loved one or the break-up of a relationship? Have you had previous bouts of depression during the summer? Without even realizing it, you may have started to associate the summer with sadness â an association that gets stronger every summer that you spend depressed. If you do have some unhappy connection with the summer, sorting it out could help you break the cycle. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your medication. If you're on medicine for depression, and you find that summer â year after year â makes your depression worse, talk to your doctor about changing your dosage. Maybe he or she could up your dose in the late spring and taper it back down in the fall. It could really help head off summer depression problems, Cook says. \u001b[92m[16] Plan your vacation carefully\u001b[0m. Before you book your plane tickets or load up your car's roof rack for your annual summer vacation, ask yourself this: Is this what you really want? Or is it an obligation you're fulfilling to a relative? Will it make you happy? Or will it stretch your finances, stress you out, and make you fall behind at work? Consider alternatives. Instead of taking a whole week off at once, might it be better to take off several long weekends spread out through the summer? Would taking time off but staying at home â a â\u001b[92m[17] staycation\u001b[0mâ â be more relaxing? Don't get locked into a vacation that won't feel like a vacation. Don't beat yourself up. One thing that's hard about summer depression is that you feel so out of step. Everyone else seems to be having such a swell time. You aren't. You keep asking yourself, â What's wrong with me?â Try not to think that way. â So much of our misery grows out of the gap between where we are and where we think we ought to be,â says Cook. So stop worrying about how you feel relative to other people. Stop assuming that you're supposed to be happy just because the calendar says it's June. Instead, concentrate on what's triggering your summer depression and how you can overcome it. â Treatments do work,â says Cook. â Psychotherapy or medication can blunt the effects of a seasonal depression. Summers really don't have to be so bad.â\n",

That's because these are common, severe illnesses and leading causes of disability. Depression and bipolar disorder can be emotionally crippling, making it difficult to live life to its fullest. Persistent Depressive Disorder, a newer diagnosis that consolidates chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder, is a condition where a person is depressed for at least 2 years. Persistent Depressive Disorder is a less severe form of depression. Although less extreme, Persistent Depressive Disorder ( PDD) causes chronic or long-lasting moodiness that ranges in severity. It is marked by a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years. In children and teens, moods can be irritable for at least 1 year to be called Persistent Depressive Disorder. PDD can occur alone or with other psychiatric or mood disorders, although not with mania or hypomania. As with depression, PDD is more common in women than in men. A family history of mood disorders is not uncommon. This mood disorder tends to appear earlier than major depression, although it can begin anytime from childhood to later in life. Up to 4% of the general population is affected by PDD. Its cause is not well understood. A combination of factors likely conspires to create this mood disorder. These factors may include: Genetics Abnormalities in the functioning of brain circuits involve in emotional processing Chronic stress or medical illness Isolation Poor coping strategies and problems adjusting to life stresses These factors can feed off each other. For example, if you always see \"the glass as half empty,\" you may reinforce the symptoms of depression. And a chronic mood disorder can sensitize you to stress, further feeding your risk for depression. In addition to chronic low moods, common symptoms of this mood disorder include: Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness Trouble sleeping or daytime sleepiness Poor appetite or eating too much Poor concentration Fatigue or low energy Low self-esteem Trouble concentrating or making decisions A diagnosis of PDD in adults requires at least a two-year history of depressed mood for most of the day on most days, along with at least two of the symptoms noted above. Although some symptoms may overlap, you may be less likely to have weight or sleep changes with PDD than with depression. You may also tend to withdraw more and have stronger feelings of pessimism and inadequacy than with major depression. Staying in a constant state of moodiness is no way to live. That's one reason to seek treatment. Another is that PDD can also increase your risk for physical diseases. Yet another reason to pursue treatment? If left untreated, this mood disorder can develop into more severe depression. It can also increase your risk for attempting suicide. Antidepressants \u001b[92m[1] , such as selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants, are often used to treat PDD\u001b[0m. Because you may need to continue treatment for a lengthy period, it's important to consider which medications not only work well but also ideally have few side effects. You may need to try more than one medication to find the one that works best. But know that it may take several weeks or longer to take effect. Successful treatment for chronic depression often takes longer than for acute (non-chronic) depression. \u001b[92m[2] Take your medications as your doctor instructs\u001b[0m. If they're causing side effects or still not working after several weeks, discuss this with your doctor. Don't suddenly stop taking your medications. \u001b[92m[3] Doctors believe treatment for PDD is effective with a combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy\u001b[0m. Specific kinds of talk therapy, such as \u001b[92m[4] cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or interpersonal therapy ( IP\u001b[0mT), are known to be effective forms of psychotherapy that treat PDD. A structured treatment lasting for a certain period of time, CBT involves recognizing and restructuring thoughts. It can help you change your distorted thinking. IPT is also a time-limited, structured treatment. Its focus is on addressing current problems and solving interpersonal conflicts. Psychodynamic psychotherapy involves exploring unhealthy or unsatisfying patterns of behavior and motivations that you may not be consciously aware of which could lead to feelings of depression and negative expectations and life experiences. \u001b[92m[5] Some studies also suggest that aerobic exercise can help with mood disorders\u001b[0m. This is most effective when done four to six times a week. But some exercise is better than none at all. Other changes may also help, including seeking social support and finding an interesting occupation. Used for patients with major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern (formerly known as seasonal affective disorder), \u001b[92m[6] bright-light therapy may also help some people with PDD\u001b[0m. Bipolar disorder causes severe, unusual shifts in mood and energy that affect your ability to do normal tasks at home, school, or work. Cyclothymic disorder is often thought of as a mild form of bipolar disorder. With cyclothymic disorder, you have low-grade high periods (hypomanias) as well as brief, fleeting periods of depression that don't last as long (less than 2 weeks at a time) as in a major depressive episode. The hypomanias in cyclothymic disorder are similar to those seen in bipolar II disorder, and do not progress to full-blown manias. For example, you may feel an exaggerated sense of productivity or power, but you don't lose connection with reality. In fact, some people feel the \"highs\" of cyclothymic disorder are even enjoyable. They tend to not be as disabling as they are with bipolar disorder. Up to 1% of the U. S. population -- equal numbers of men and women -- has cyclothymia. Its cause is unknown, but genetics may play a role; cyclothymia is more common in people with relatives who have bipolar disorder. Symptoms usually appear in adolescence or young adulthood. But because symptoms are mild, it is often difficult to tell when cyclothymia begins. A diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder may result from simply describing symptoms like these: Episodes that involve brief, recurrent periods of depression and, at other times, episodes of hypomania; this pattern of episodes must be present for at least 2 years. Symptoms that persist, creating fewer than 2 symptom-free months in a row. The episodes of cyclothymic disorder are often somewhat unpredictable. Either depression or hypomania can last for days or weeks, interspersed with a month or two of normal moods. Or, you may have no \"normal\" periods in between. In some cases, cyclothymic disorder progresses to full-blown bipolar disease. Some people with mild symptoms of cyclothymia are able to live successful, fulfilling lives. Others find their relationships troubled by depression, impulsive actions, and strong emotions. For these people, short-term medications may bring relief. However, cyclothymic disorder may not respond as well to medications as does bipolar disorder. A combination of mood stabilizers and psychotherapy is most effective. Mood stabilizers include antiseizure drugs such as lithium, Depakote, Tegretol, or Lamictal.\n",

      "Some people with diabetes and the nerve pain -- or peripheral neuropathy that comes with it -- find relief in surprisingly simple ways. Sometimes a nice, warm (but not hot) bath is enough to relieve stress and nerve pain. If you have neuropathy, by the way, you might want to have someone else test the water to make sure it's not too hot. A massage can also help. Other people turn to biofeedback, meditation, relaxation techniques, or hypnosis -- all of which have been proven to help. \" These methods of alternative medicine have shown tremendous promise,\" says Tom Elasy, MD, director of the Diabetes Clinic at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. \" I have many patients who have pursued alternative approaches, and I get very positive feedback about the results.\" It is possible, through biofeedback, to train the body to decrease the severity of diabetes nerve pain. This involves consciously controlling a body function that is normally regulated by the body -- like skin temperature, heart rate, or blood pressure. It may sound like science fiction, but evidence of the benefits of biofeedback is quite good. It's been used to help control migraine pain, epilepsy seizures, high blood pressure, and other common problems. How does it work? You wear sensors on your head and elsewhere that let you \"hear\" or \"see\" certain bodily functions such as pulse, digestion, body temperature, and muscle tension. The squiggly lines and/or beeps on the attached monitors reflect what's going on inside your body. Then you learn to control those beeps and squiggles. After a few sessions, your mind has trained your biological system to learn the skills. It is not hard to master, say experts. Meditation is a therapy offered in many pain treatment centers for diabetes and other painful disorders. Research shows that meditation can lower blood pressure and improve heart rate, breathing, and brain waves. Tension and tightness seep from muscles as the body receives a quiet message to relax. The soothing power of repetition is at the heart of meditation. Focusing on the breath, ignoring thoughts, and repeating a word or phrase -- a mantra -- makes the body relax. People describe feeling warmth, calm, even a sense of heaviness while they meditate. While you can learn meditation on your own, it helps to take a class. A teacher can guide you -- and help you reach that deeper, more relaxed state. Stress can make neuropathy pain worse, so it is important to learn to relax. Your breathing pattern is often affected by changes in emotions. That's why managing your breathing is an important tool for relaxation. By becoming familiar with your own breathing patterns, you can learn to control your breathing, stress level, and pain as well. First, \u001b[92m[4] find a quiet location, a comfortable body position, and a good state of mind\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[5] Try to block out worries and distracting thoughts\u001b[0m. Relaxation techniques to help with diabetes nerve pain include: Rhythmic breathing: Take long, slow breaths. Inhale slowly, and then exhale slowly. Count slowly to five as you inhale. Then count slowly to five as you exhale. Pay attention to how your body naturally relaxes. This will help you relax even more. Deep breathing: Imagine a spot just below your navel. Breathe into that spot, filling the abdomen with air. Let the air fill you from the abdomen up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. \u001b[92m[6] Visualized breathing: Find a comfortable place where you can close your eyes\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[7] Picture relaxation entering your body -- and tension leaving the body\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[8] Breathe deeply, but in a natural rhythm\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[9] Visualize the breath coming into your nostrils, going into your lungs\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[10] Picture it expanding your chest and abdomen\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[11] Then, visualize the breath going out the same way\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[12] Each time you exhale, imagine you are getting rid of a little more tension\u001b[0m. Relax to music: Put on some music that lifts your mood and that you find soothing and calming. There are specially designed relaxation audio tapes or CDs that are perfect for this. Mental imagery relaxation: This is also called guided imagery. It is a form of \"\u001b[92m[1] mental escape\u001b[0m\" in which you \u001b[92m[2] create calming, peaceful images in your mind\u001b[0m. You also identify self-talk -- your thoughts about your illness -- and \u001b[92m[3] focus on positive thoughts and emotions\u001b[0m instead. Self-hypnosis is the path to training both mind and body to make a desired change such as controlling diabetes pain. It is a skill that must be learned from a trained therapist and involves focusing attention for a desired purpose. With practice, hypnotizing yourself can be easy. You focus your attention on an image that blocks the perception of pain -- and you feel less pain. Your subconscious has grabbed hold of that message, replaying it time and again. The mind has learned to control the body. Scientists say hypnosis seems to block nerve pain receptors in the brain. Those receptors control sensations of pain, anxiety, and discomfort. Studies have shown that pain related to cancer, surgery, back injuries, and migraines responds well to hypnosis. A growing number of people are using acupuncture to treat neuropathy pain linked with diabetes and other health-related problems. What is acupuncture? It is a practice in which fine needles are inserted into the skin to stimulate specific points in the body. Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the theory that energy flows through the body along certain pathways, called âchi'. Illness or pain results when that energy is blocked or out of balance. The Chinese theory holds that acupuncture unblocks or balances that flow of energy. Many Western researchers say acupuncture may alter brain chemicals that affect the body and mind. Translated into the language of Western medicine, the healing power of acupuncture may come from its effect on the nervous system, on hormones, and on \"feel good\" brain chemicals called endorphins. One landmark study found that patients have reduced pain and improved movement with acupuncture. The National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization have both approved certain uses of acupuncture related to pain. Acupuncture also appears to be very safe. Relatively few complications from the use of acupuncture have been reported to the FDA even though millions of people are treated with acupuncture each year, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Still, poorly sterilized needles or improper treatments have caused some complications. It's important to make sure you go to well-trained and experienced acupuncturist. Your doctor may be able to help you with a recommendation.\n",

      "\u001b[92m[1] Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a 2010 survival horror adventure game developed and published by Frictional Games\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[2] It was released in 2010 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux operating systems\u001b[0m, in 2016 for the PlayStation 4 platform and in 2018 for the Xbox One. The game features a protagonist named Daniel exploring a dark and foreboding castle called Brennenburg, while trying to maintain his sanity by avoiding monsters and unsettling events. The game was critically well-received, earning two awards from the Independent Games Festival and numerous positive reviews. An indirect sequel to The Dark Descent, titled Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, was released on 10 September 2013. The Amnesia Collection – which contains The Dark Descent, its Amnesia: Justine expansion and A Machine for Pigs was released for PlayStation 4 on 22 November 2016, and for Xbox One on 28 September 2018. The same collection was released on the Nintendo Switch on 12 September 2019. A second sequel, developed by Frictional Games, Amnesia: Rebirth, was announced on 6 March 2020, and was released on 20 October 2020. The third sequel, Amnesia: The Bunker, was released on 6 June 2023. Gameplay Daniel is chased by a Grunt, one of several monsters encountered in the castle. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a first-person adventure game with survival horror elements. The player takes control of Daniel, who must navigate Castle Brennenburg while avoiding various dangers and solving puzzles. The gameplay retains the physical object interaction used in the Penumbra series, allowing for physics-based puzzles and interactions such as opening doors and fixing machinery. Smaller items can be stored in an inventory menu, while larger objects can be raised by holding down a mouse button and pushing or pulling the mouse. Objects such as doors or levers can be manipulated by using the mouse in a fashion that imitates moving the said object. The difficulty level can be adjusted before starting the game, but cannot be readjusted once the game has begun. \n",

      "Dengue (pronounced DENgee) fever is a painful, debilitating mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses. These viruses are related to the viruses that cause West Nile infection and yellow fever. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; Mayo Clinic: \" Dengue Fever. \"; CDC: \" Dengue - Frequently Asked Questions.\" MICHAEL SMITH: If you're packing for a trip somewhere nice and warm, don't forget your bug spray. That will help keep you safe from dengue fever, a virus spread by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Once an infected mosquito bites someone, they can get a fever, headaches, and pain in the joints, muscles, bones, and behind the eyes. Some people get a rash and have nausea and vomiting. It sounds awful, but most people recover in a week or so. But if the symptoms get worse and you don't see a doctor, it can become life threatening. There is unfortunately no vaccine or cure for dengue fever, so if you think you have it, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take a pain reliever with acetaminophen. Don't take aspirin. If you feel worse after the first 24 hours, make sure you get treatment. For Web MD, I'm Dr. Michael Smith. if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } An estimated 400 million dengue infections occur worldwide each year, with about 96 million resulting in illness. Most cases occur in tropical areas of the world, with the greatest risk occurring in: The Indian subcontinent Southeast Asia Southern China Taiwan The Pacific Islands The Caribbean (except Cuba and the Cayman Islands) Mexico Africa Central and South America (except Chile, Paraguay, and Argentina) Most cases in the United States occur in people who contracted the infection while traveling abroad. But the risk is increasing for people living along the Texas- Mexico border and in other parts of the southern United States. In 2014, an outbreak of dengue fever was identified in Hawaii with other outbreaks in 2013 in Brownsville, Texas and Key West, Fla. Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus. The mosquito becomes infected when it bites a person with dengue virus in their blood. It can't be spread directly from one person to another person. Symptoms, which usually begin four to six days after infection and last for up to 10 days, may include Sudden, high fever Severe headaches Pain behind the eyes Severe joint and muscle pain Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Skin rash, which appears two to five days after the onset of fever Mild bleeding (such a nose bleed, bleeding gums, or easy bruising) Sometimes, symptoms are mild and can be mistaken for those of the flu or another viral infection. Younger children and people who have never had the infection before tend to have milder cases than older children and adults. However, serious problems can develop. These include dengue hemorrhagic fever, a rare complication characterized by high fever, damage to lymph and blood vessels, bleeding from the nose and gums, enlargement of the liver, and failure of the circulatory system. The symptoms may progress to massive bleeding, shock, and death. This is called dengue shock syndrome ( DSS). People with weakened immune systems as well as those with a second or subsequent dengue infection are believed to be at greater risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever. Doctors can diagnose dengue infection with a blood test to check for the virus or antibodies to it. If you become sick after traveling to a tropical area, let your doctor know. This will allow your doctor to evaluate the possibility that your symptoms were caused by a dengue infection. There is no specific medicine to treat dengue infection. If you think you may have dengue fever, you should use pain relievers with acetaminophen and avoid medicines with aspirin, which could worsen bleeding. You should also rest, drink plenty of fluids, and see your doctor. If you start to feel worse in the first 24 hours after your fever goes down, you should get to a hospital immediately to be checked for complications. The best way to prevent the disease is to prevent bites by infected mosquitoes, particularly if you are living in or traveling to a tropical area. This involves protecting yourself and making efforts to keep the mosquito population down. In 2019, the FDA approved a vaccine called Dengvaxia to help prevent the disease from occurring in adolescents aged 9 to 16 who have already been infected by dengue. But, there currently is no vaccine to prevent the general population from contracting it. To protect yourself: Use mosquito repellents, even indoors. When outdoors, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into socks. When indoors, use air conditioning if available. Make sure window and door screens are secure and free of holes. If sleeping areas are not screened or air conditioned, use mosquito nets. If you have symptoms of dengue, speak to your doctor. To reduce the mosquito population, \u001b[92m[1] get rid of places where mosquitoes can breed\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[2] These include old tires, cans, or flower pots that collect rain\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[3] Regularly change the water in outdoor bird baths and pets' water dishes\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[4] If someone in your home gets dengue fever, be especially vigilant about efforts to protect yourself and other family members from mosquitoes\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[5] Mosquitoes that bite the infected family member could spread the infection to others in your home\u001b[0m.\n",

      "Hoffer states that mass movements begin with a widespread 'desire for change' from discontented people who place their locus of control outside their power and who also have no confidence in existing culture or traditions. Feeling their lives are 'irredeemably spoiled' and believing there is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual, true believers seek 'self-renunciation'. Thus, such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives in a larger collective. \u001b[92m[1] Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts\u001b[0m. While mass movements are usually some blend of nationalist, political and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: 'All mass movements are competitive' and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and 'all mass movements are interchangeable'. As examples of the interchangeable nature of mass movements, Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for the same type of angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals.

      "\u001b[1;35;40m[2] In making history the masses have traversed a course of gradually developing from being unaware to being aware\u001b[0m. The founding of the Marxist materialist conception of history showed the objective laws of the development of society and history, bringing the role of the masses in making history to a new stage and opening up a broad avenue for mankind to leave the realm of necessity in which man is blindly at the disposal of history and enter the realm of freedom in which man will consciously handle history. As Chairman Mao has put it, 'The epoch of world communism will be reached when all mankind voluntarily and consciously changes itself and the world.' So that this day will come the proletariat and revolutionary people still need to go through arduous and tortuous struggles, which must be led by a proletarian political party if it is to win victory. \u001b[1;35;40m[3] The mass line formulated by Chairman Mao for our Party requires us to have faith in the masses, to rely on them, respect their initiative, learn wholeheartedly from them and, at the same time, to indefatigably educate them in Marxism-Leninism, steadily raise their level of political consciousness and lead them to forge ahead\u001b[0m. Lenin said: 'A party is the vanguard of a class, and its duty is to lead the masses and not merely to reflect the average political level of the masses.' (The Extraordinary All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies. [LCW 26:324]) Uphold the Marxist principle that the masses are the makers of history and adhere to the Party leadership—this is the only way to ensure that our revolutionary cause will continue to move ahead victoriously along the correct path. _______________ \n",

It can cause symptoms such as intense pain and throbbing as blood collects under the nail. Unless you also have broken bones or damage to the nail bed and/or surrounding tissues, this injury usually isn't worrisome. These injuries can happen easily. You might: Slam your finger in a car door or house door Hit your finger with a heavy object such as a hammer Drop a heavy object such as a dumbbell on your toe Stub your toe on a hard surface If you have a darkened area under a nail and haven't had an injury, see your doctor to rule out other possible causes. \u001b[92m[3] The most common symptom is severe, throbbing pain\u001b[0m. It happens because of the pressure of blood collecting between the nail and the nail bed. You may also have: A dark-colored discoloration (red, maroon, or purple-black) under all or part of the affected nail Tenderness and swelling of the tip of the affected finger or toe If you had a severe blow to a finger or toe, either seek immediate medical attention from your doctor or go to an emergency room. You should do this in case you have broken bones or serious damage to the nail bed and/or surrounding tissues. Your doctor will examine your nail. You'll probably also have an X-ray taken to see if you have a bone fracture or other injury. A painless and small subungual hematoma usually doesn't need treatment. But the pressure generated by pooled blood under the nail can be extremely painful. \u001b[92m[4] To relieve the pain, your doctor may perform decompression, also called trephination, which allows the underlying blood to drain, relieving pressure and pain to the area\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[5] Your doctor may numb the affected finger or toe with a nerve block and use one of the following decompression methods: Cautery\u001b[0m. The doctor uses a heated wire (electrocautery device) or carbon laser to burn a hole or holes. The heated tip of the wire is cooled by contact with the hematoma, which prevents injury to the nail bed. This is a quick and painless procedure. \u001b[92m[6] Needle\u001b[0m. The doctor uses a needle to make a hole in the nail. \u001b[92m[7] After the procedure, your doctor will bandage your nail\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[8] You will need to keep the finger or toe bandaged and elevated -- and may also need to use cold compresses -- during the first 12 hours after decompression\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[9] In some cases, your doctor may recommend you use a splint for as long as 3 days until the tenderness subsides\u001b[0m. The main complication associated with decompression is a small risk of infection in the residual hematoma. If you have bleeding under a large area of the nail surface, the nail bed may be injured. In this case, your doctor may need to remove the entire nail and use stitches to repair the nail bed. Unless the area of bleeding is very small, an affected nail will usually fall off on its own after several weeks because the pooled blood has separated it from its bed. A new fingernail can regrow in as little as 8 weeks. A new toenail may not fully regrow for about 6 months. \u001b[92m[10] If there has been injury to the nail bed and/or surrounding tissues, the new nail may take longer to grow\u001b[0m. Even with the best repair, there is still a possibility that the new nail may grow back and not look normal. See your doctor if you notice any problems with the nail as it heals and regrows.\n",

      "Type 1 diabetes happens when your immune system destroys cells in your pancreas called beta cells. They're the ones that make insulin. Some people get a condition called secondary diabetes. It's similar to type 1, except the immune system doesn't destroy your beta cells. They're wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body's tissues. Cells use it as fuel. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Glucose doesn't move into your cells because insulin isn't there to do it. Instead it builds up in your blood and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar, which can lead to: Dehydration. When there's extra sugar in your blood, you pee more. That's your body's way of getting rid of it. A large amount of water goes out with that urine, causing your body to dry out. Weight loss. The glucose that goes out when you pee takes calories with it. That's why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. Dehydration also plays a part. Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA). If your body can't get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body can't use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This combination of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as \"ketoacidosis\" and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Damage to your body. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes, kidneys, and heart. They can also make you more likely to get hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. It's rare. Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. It's more common in whites than in African- Americans. It affects men and women equally. Although the disease usually starts in people under 20, it can happen at any age. Doctors don't know all the things that lead to type 1 diabetes. But they do know your genes play a role. They also know type 1 diabetes can result when something in the environment, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas. Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They're present in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases, like Grave's disease or vitiligo. These are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Heavy thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Nausea and vomiting Pain in your belly Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss (even though you're eating and feel hungry) Fatigue (weak, tired feeling) Blurred vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor will call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of the skin, urinary tract, or vagina Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Pain in your belly Loss of consciousness (rare) If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, he'll check your blood sugar levels. He may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don't have enough insulin. Right now there's no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Many people with type 1 diabetes live long, healthy lives. \u001b[92m[1] The key to good health is to keep your blood sugar levels within the range your doctor gives you\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[2] You'll need to check them often and adjust insulin, food, and activities to make that happen\u001b[0m. All people with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, he'll mention three main things: \" Onset\" is the length of time before it reaches your bloodstream and begins lowering blood sugar. \" Peak time\" is the time when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering blood sugar. \" Duration\" is how long it keeps working after onset. Several types of insulin are available. Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks around 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps working for 3 to 6 hours. Intermediate-acting won't get into your bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after injection. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours and works for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts for about 24 hours. Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two different types of insulin. You may progress to three or four shots a day. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end, and give yourself the shot. Some now comes in a prefilled pen. One kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump -- a device you wear that sends it into your body via a small tube. Your doctor will help you to pick the type and the delivery method that's best for you. Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn't as simple as going out for a run. You have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Knowledge is power. \u001b[92m[3] Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you\u001b[0m. Some things will make your levels go up; others won't. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to prevent it from dropping too low. \u001b[92m[4] If your test is high, test for ketones -- acids that can result from high sugar levels\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[5] If they're OK, you should be good to go\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[6] If they're high, skip the workout\u001b[0m. You'll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started. If you don't keep your type 1 diabetes well controlled, you could set yourself up for serious or life-threatening problems: Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. It's rare before puberty no matter how long you've had the disease. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Kidney damage. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chances grow over time. It's most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems like kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood circulation and nerve damage. Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of sensation in and a lack of blood supply to your feet. This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. And when that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n",

      "\u001b[96m[1] Seafloor spreading occurs at spreading centers, distributed along the crests of mid-ocean ridges\u001b[0m. Spreading centers end in transform faults or in overlapping spreading center offsets. A spreading center includes a seismically active plate boundary zone a few kilometers to tens of kilometers wide, a crustal accretion zone within the boundary zone where the ocean crust is youngest, and an instantaneous plate boundary - a line within the crustal accretion zone demarcating the two separating plates. Within the crustal accretion zone is a 1–2 km-wide neovolcanic zone where active volcanism occurs. Incipient spreading Plates in the crust of the earth, according to the plate tectonics theory In the general case, seafloor spreading starts as a rift in a continental land mass, similar to the Red Sea-East Africa Rift System today. The process starts by heating at the base of the continental crust which causes it to become more plastic and less dense. Because less dense objects rise in relation to denser objects, the area being heated becomes a broad dome (see isostasy). As the crust bows upward, fractures occur that gradually grow into rifts. The typical rift system consists of three rift arms at approximately 120-degree angles. These areas are named triple junctions and can be found in several places across the world today. The separated margins of the continents evolve to form passive margins. Hess' theory was that new seafloor is formed when magma is forced upward toward the surface at a mid-ocean ridge. \n",

      "Seafloor spreading, or seafloor spread, is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. History of study Earlier theories by Alfred Wegener and Alexander du Toit of continental drift postulated that continents in motion 'plowed' through the fixed and immovable seafloor. The idea that the seafloor itself moves and also carries the continents with it as it spreads from a central rift axis was proposed by Harold Hammond Hess from Princeton University and Robert Dietz of the U.S. Naval Electronics Laboratory in San Diego in the 1960s. The phenomenon is known today as plate tectonics. In locations where two plates move apart, at mid-ocean ridges, new seafloor is continually formed during seafloor spreading. Significance Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate slab pull at subduction zones, rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. Plates that are not subducting are driven by gravity sliding off the elevated mid-ocean ridges a process called ridge push. \u001b[92m[2] At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed\u001b[0m. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Spreading rate is the rate at which an ocean basin widens due to seafloor spreading. (The rate at which new oceanic lithosphere is added to each tectonic plate on either side of a mid-ocean ridge is the spreading half-rate and is equal to half of the spreading rate). Spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 90 mm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 40–90 mm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 40 mm/year.: 2 The highest known rate was over 200 mm/yr during the Miocene on the East Pacific Rise. \n",

      "Seafloor spreading is a geologic process where the Earth's oceanic crust moves away from underwater volcanic ridges, creating new crust. This hypothesis, proposed by Harry Hess in the 1960s, is crucial in understanding the Earth's lithosphere and plate tectonics theory. The process begins with the formation of new crust at mid-ocean ridges, where two tectonic plates are diverging. As new crust forms, it pushes older crust away, causing the seafloor to spread. Evidence for seafloor spreading includes the age of the ocean floor, magnetic stripes, and deep ocean trenches. This hypothesis has significantly advanced our understanding of Earth's dynamic geologic processes, such as continental movement and the formation of major geological features. Step by step solution 01 Introduction to Seafloor Spreading \u001b[1;35;40m[3] The process of seafloor spreading begins with the formation of new crust at the mid-ocean ridges\u001b[0m. \u001b[1;35;40m[4] These ridges are long, narrow volcanic features found on the ocean floor, where two tectonic plates are diverging (or moving apart)\u001b[0m. \u001b[1;35;40m[5] Here, the hot molten material called magma from the Earth's mantle rises up through the crust, as the plates pull apart from each other\u001b[0m. \u001b[1;35;40m[6] The magma then cools down and solidifies, forming a new crust beneath the ocean\u001b[0m. As new crust continues to form, it pushes the existing crust further away from the ridge in both directions. This causes the seafloor to spread, leading to the expansion of the ocean basin. 03 Evidence for Seafloor Spreading Several pieces of evidence support the hypothesis of seafloor spreading: \n",

      "Nearly 30% of people in the U. S. have at least one tattoo. Almost half of all millennials have one. But not all of them are happy about their decision. As many as 25% of those with a tattoo say they regret getting it. If you're in that 25%, there is good news. Laser tattoo removal techniques can get rid of your unwanted tattoo with minimal side effects. Lasers remove tattoos by breaking up the pigment colors with a high-intensity light beam. Black tattoo pigment absorbs all laser wavelengths, making it the easiest color to treat. Other colors can only be treated by selected lasers based upon the pigment color. You should first schedule a consultation with a trained professional who can evaluate your tattoo and advise you on the process. The number of treatments you will need will depend on the age, size, and color(s) of your tattoo. The color of your skin, as well as how deep the tattoo pigment goes, will also affect the removal technique. In general, this is what you should expect during a laser tattoo removal session: \u001b[92m[1] You'll be given a pair of protective eye shields\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[2] The technician will test your skin's reaction to the laser to determine the most effective energy for treatment\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[3] The technician uses the laser to pass pulses of intense light through the top layers of your skin that will be absorbed by the tattoo pigment only\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[4] Smaller tattoos will require fewer pulses while larger ones will need more to remove them\u001b[0m. In either case, to completely get rid of a tattoo, it will take several treatments. After each visit, your tattoo should become progressively lighter. \u001b[92m[5] Laser tattoo removal is uncomfortable, but most patients don't need anesthesia\u001b[0m. Depending on the location of your tattoo, you may want to apply a topical anesthesia cream beforehand. \u001b[92m[6] Immediately following the treatment, use an ice pack to soothe the treated area\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[7] And apply an antibiotic cream or ointment and bandage to protect it\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[8] You should also be sure it's covered with sunblock when you're outside\u001b[0m. Laser treatment is often safer than many other tattoo removal methods, such as excision, dermabrasion, or salabrasion because laser treatment selectively treats the pigment in the tattoo. And there are very few side effects. However, you should consider these factors in your decision: \u001b[92m[9] Your tattoo removal site is at risk for infection\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[10] And there is a slight chance that you will have a permanent scar\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[11] It's unlikely that your tattoo will be completely removed\u001b[0m. In many cases, certain colors may be more effectively removed than others. Blue and black tattoos, for example, respond well to laser treatment. \u001b[92m[12] You may end up with hypopigmentation, which means the skin that is treated is paler than the skin surrounding it\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[13] You could also have hyperpigmentation, which leaves the affected skin darker than the rest of your skin\u001b[0m. Cosmetic tattoos like lip liner, eyeliner, and eyebrows may actually get darker after treatment. They do tend to fade with additional sessions. To ensure you get proper treatment and care, find a reputable dermatologist or cosmetic surgery center. If possible, get a recommendation from your primary care physician for a dermatologist or skin surgery center that specializes in tattoo removal. Since tattoo removal is a personal option in most cases, most insurance carriers won't cover the process unless it is medically necessary. Physicians or surgery centers practicing tattoo removal may also require payment in full on the day of the procedure. If you are considering tattoo removal, be sure to discuss associated costs up front and obtain all charges in writing before you undergo any treatment.\n",

      "If you're a parent, you've probably dealt with your fair share of spit-up. \u001b[92m[1] Every baby does it at least every now and then\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[2] Some do it pretty often, even with every feeding\u001b[0m. Most babies who spit up are \"happy spitters\" -- they're content, comfortable, growing well, and have no breathing problems caused by vomiting. If that sounds like your little one, he doesn't need medicine. If not, tell your doctor what you've noticed so she can see what the problem is. \u001b[92m[3] After your baby swallows milk, it glides past the back of his throat and goes down a muscular tube, called the esophagus, to his stomach\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[4] A ring of muscles connects the esophagus and stomach\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[5] It opens to let the milk go into the stomach, and then it closes back up\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[6] If that ring, called the lower esophageal sphincter, doesn't tighten again, the milk can come back up\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[7] That's reflux\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[8] Infants are especially likely to get reflux because their stomachs are small -- about the size of their fists or a golf ball -- so they fill up easily\u001b[0m. Also, a valve where their esophagus meets their stomach may not be mature enough yet to work like it should. That usually happens around age 4-5 months. After that, he may stop spitting up. Unlike happy spitters, babies with GERD may have: Discomfort and pain caused by the reflux Breathing problems, like gagging, choking, coughing, wheezing, and, worst-case scenario, pneumonia from inhaling their stomach contents into their lungs Sometimes poor growth, because vomiting keeps them from getting enough nutrients If your baby has any of these symptoms, talk to your pediatrician, who can see if your baby has GERD. 1. \u001b[92m[9] Keep your baby upright for 30 minutes after a feeding to let gravity help keep things down\u001b[0m. 2. \u001b[92m[10] Make sure there is no pressure on his stomach after he eats\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[11] For example, wait at least 30 minutes before you put your baby in his car seat\u001b[0m. 3. \u001b[92m[12] Burp him after every feeding\u001b[0m. Sometimes these simple steps help enough to keep your little one a happy spitter. If not, your pediatrician may suggest medications that can help. Each has possible benefits and side effects.

He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 'Billboard' Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single 'Candle in the Wind 1997', rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, 'Empty Sky', was released. In 1970, his first hit single, 'Your Song', from his second album, 'Elton John', reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for 'The Lion King' and its stage adaptation, 'Aida' and 'Billy Elliot the Musical'. John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, 'Rolling Stone' ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, 'Billboard' ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the 'Billboard' Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for 'services to music and charitable services' in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012.

      "\u001b[92m[1] The California Gold Rush began with the discovery of significant gold deposits near Sacramento in 1848\u001b[0m. As accounts of the discovery spread, residents of the thinly-populated West Coast poured into the gold fields and migrants swarmed in from the Far East, Mexico, South America, and the East Coast – which provided about 80 percent of the newcomers. The rush occurred because the gold mining industry was very labor intensive and was easy to enter due to modest capital requirements and laws which made acquiring a claim stake fairly simple. Many easterners went overland in wagon trains through undeveloped territory – a trip that took from April or May until September and cost around $200 at a time when laborers earned somewhat less than one dollar per day in the East. Others came by ship – either sailing around South America or sailing to Panama, crossing the isthmus, and then boarding another ship to San Francisco. The trip via Central America took six to eight weeks, but was very dangerous due to disease, an issue that abated when Cornelius Vanderbilt forged a path through Nicaragua in 1851 and William Henry Aspinwall completed a railroad across the Panamian isthmus in 1855. Sailing around Cape Horn could take from three to eight months depending on winds. After the arduous trip miners faced shockingly high prices for food, supplies, rent and other goods and services and endured mining camps that lacked basic sanitation. \n",

War with Mexico When the United States and Mexico went to war in 1846, California was under the loose control of the Mexican government. California's population consisted of about 6,500 Californios (people of Spanish or Mexican decent), 700 foreigners (primarily Americans), and 150,000 Native Americans, whose numbers had been cut in half since the arrival of the Spanish in 1769.

      "Gold was discovered in California in the late 1840s, and it caused a mass migration to the soon-to-be state. \u001b[0;34;47m[7] The California Gold Rush encouraged people to move westward in hopes that they’d strike it rich\u001b[0m. \u001b[0;34;47m[8] It largely influenced the growth of California’s major cities and urged the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad that linked the east coast of the US to the West\u001b[0m. The large influx of people from all around the world also influenced restrictions on immigration to the states as xenophobia worsened. Once the excitement of gold hunting calmed, people settled in the state, established businesses, and began farming to make ends meet. Events Leading Up to the California Gold Rush Illustration depicting the Mexican War of Independence, via Texas State Historical Association California was in a transitional period prior to the discovery of gold. Spain had ownership of the land up until the end of the Mexican War of Independence in 1821. As Spain was at the height of political turmoil in the early 19th century, the people of Mexico seized the opportunity of Spain’s fragile state to seek independence. Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla is largely responsible for sparking the revolution when he called for Mexican independence in a speech called the Grito de Dolores in September 1810. \n",

      "\n",
      "SOURCE:  https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/retinopathy-causes-treatments\n",
      "In people with diabetes, \u001b[92m[1] high blood sugar damages the walls of the small blood vessels in the eye, altering their structure and function\u001b[0m. These vessels may thicken, leak, develop clots, close off, or grow balloon-like defects called microaneurysms. Frequently, fluid accumulates in the part of the retina used in tasks such as reading; this condition is called macular edema. In advanced cases, the retina is robbed of its blood supply and grows new, but defective, vessels -- a process called neovascularization. These fragile vessels can bleed, creating vision-impairing hemorrhages, scar tissue, and separation of the retina from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). The new vessels can also block fluid flow within the eye, producing glaucoma. It's important that anyone who has diabetes gets annual eye exams from an ophthalmologist so diabetic retinopathy can be detected early. When you visit an ophthalmologist, he or she will question you about your medical history and vision and will ask you to read an eye chart. The doctor will then directly examine your retina using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. Some of the features of diabetic retinopathy cannot be seen during a basic eye exam and require special exams. To get a better look at the inside of the eye, your doctor might administer drops to dilate your pupils and will then view the retina with lenses and a special light called a slit lamp. A test called fluorescein angiography can reveal changes in the structure and function of the retinal blood vessels. For this test, the doctor injects a fluorescent yellow dye into one of your veins and then photographs your retina as the dye outlines the blood vessels. The eye exam will likely also include a check for glaucoma and cataracts, both of which occur more frequently in people with diabetes and can cause vision problems. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy should involve both a medical doctor and an ophthalmologist. Your medical doctor can help you better control blood sugar and can treat other complications of diabetes that may worsen diabetic retinopathy, such as impaired kidney or heart function. Your ophthalmologist can directly treat retinopathy with a laser or a surgical procedure called vitrectomy, to prevent further vascular changes and preserve vision. Don't be surprised if your doctor recommends one of these treatments before you notice any vision problems: Before problems start is usually the best time for treatment. Laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy, called laser photocoagulation, works in part by creating tiny, painless retinal burns that seal off leaking vessels and reduce swelling. The number of burns the doctor makes and the number of treatments you need depend on the type and extent of your retinopathy and how well it responds to treatment. You may have to wait several months to find out if this treatment is improving your condition. Your doctor may recommend vitrectomy surgery if you have a hemorrhage that doesn't clear, if you have retinal detachment, or if laser treatment doesn't sufficiently halt the growth of new vessels. During vitrectomy, your doctor drains the gel-like substance inside the eye, allowing her to clear any lingering blood and to remove scar tissue. The vitreous fluid is then replaced with a substitute fluid. Rare complications of treatment may include blurred vision, headache, glaucoma, difficulty seeing in the dark, decreased peripheral and color vision, and bleeding. In most cases when treatment is recommended, the benefits outweigh the risks. Although both of these treatments can be very effective, your expectations for either treatment should be realistic. Typically laser or surgical treatment will not restore lost vision; however, treatment can prevent any additional loss of eyesight. If you already have vision loss, your doctor can counsel you about options for visual rehabilitation. Diabetic retinopathy can be minimized with a combination of strict blood sugar control and routine screening with eye exams -- though even with optimal medical care, it is not always possible to prevent or slow retinal damage. Studies have shown that maintaining near-normal blood sugar can decrease the chance of developing retinopathy and can help keep existing retinopathy from getting worse. Your doctor can provide you with guidelines that may include insulin and other medications, dietary modifications, and exercise. Intensive insulin therapy, which may include frequent blood sugar testing and the use of an insulin pump, may be an option. It's not always easy to stick to the disciplined lifestyle necessary to control your blood sugar; don't hesitate to tell your doctor if you need extra support to adhere to his guidelines. Routine screening offers the best hope for early detection of diabetic retinopathy. People with type 1 diabetes should have a complete eye exam within five years of diagnosis; those with type 2 should have an eye exam at the time their diabetes is diagnosed. After these initial exams, all people with diabetes should have an eye exam at least once a year. Your doctor may recommend more frequent screenings depending on the severity of retinal damage and on other diabetes complications you have. Pregnancy can precipitate or worsen retinopathy in women with diabetes who take insulin, so any such woman considering pregnancy should discuss the risks with her doctor. Your doctor will usually recommend an eye exam before pregnancy, a second exam during the first trimester, and additional exams at intervals based on the status of your retinopathy. \u001b[92m[2] Women who suddenly develop diabetes during a pregnancy (gestational diabetes) are not at risk of developing retinopathy during the pregnancy\u001b[0m. High blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and obesity can all promote diabetic retinopathy and should be treated. Smoking is also a culprit: Consult with your doctor about methods for quitting. Never ignore the symptoms of infection, which can worsen diabetic retinopathy. Cataract surgery can affect existing retinopathy, too, so discuss the timing of treatments for retinopathy and cataracts with your doctor. Researchers continue to investigate new drugs that may prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy; your doctor can provide information about the latest medications approved for these purposes. Depending on the severity of your diabetes and related complications, you may also want to discuss the options of pancreas and kidney transplants, which may protect against retinopathy. You or your child has been diagnosed with diabetes and you have not discussed retinopathy and routine eye exams with your doctor. You experience either gradual or sudden loss of vision. You have diabetes and are considering pregnancy. You are having trouble sticking to your doctor's recommendations for controlling blood sugar. You have vision loss and would like to discuss options for improving your vision.\n",

      "Many people with hiatal hernia, a condition in which part of the stomach bulges upward through an opening in the diaphragm, have no symptoms. For those who do, what they eat may make a difference between a good day (or night) and a bad one. Diet can play an important role in controlling the symptoms of hiatal hernia, namely heartburn and acid indigestion. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } \u001b[92m[1] When you have a hiatal hernia, it is easier for stomach acids to come up into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from your throat to your stomach\u001b[0m. This causes a burning feeling in your throat and chest. Certain foods can make these symptoms worse for some people. \u001b[92m[2] Fortunately, heartburn symptoms associated with hiatal hernia often can be controlled with diet and lifestyle changes\u001b[0m. The following foods are highly acidic or may weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, making it easier for stomach acids to back up into your esophagus. They may cause heartburn symptoms. Citrus foods, such as oranges, grapefruits, and lemons, and orange juice, grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, and lemonade Chocolate Fatty and fried foods, such as fried chicken and fatty cuts of meat Garlic and onions Spicy food Peppermint and spearmint Tomato-based foods such as spaghetti sauce, pizza, chili, salsa, and tomato juice Coffee, tea (including decaffeinated versions), and alcohol Carbonated beverages Dairy products, such as whole milk, ice cream, and creamed food. Try soy milk; it may be a good milk substitute. Also, mild cheeses, like feta or goat, may be enjoyed in moderation. Oil and butter The following foods are low-acid-producing foods and are less likely to aggravate your hiatal hernia symptoms: Bananas and apples Green beans, peas, carrots, and broccoli Grains, like cereals (bran and oatmeal), bread, rice, pasta, and crackers Low-fat or skim milk and low-fat yogurt Fat-free cheeses, cream cheese, and fat-free sour cream Lean meat, chicken, and fish Water Pretzels, graham crackers, rice cakes, and baked potato chips Low-fat sweets (no chocolate or mint) You may find that some of the foods listed under \"foods to avoid\" may not bother you, while others on the \"foods to enjoy\" list may cause discomfort. Everyone tolerates food differently. To determine the best diet for you, keep a food diary for a few weeks. And then avoid anything that causes you to have symptoms. A good way to enjoy the foods listed above is to cook them in a healthy way. Here are some heartburn-friendly cooking tips: Choose lean meats, such as skinless chicken, meat with little visible fat, ground turkey instead of ground beef, and fish. Lean beef cuts include round, chuck, sirloin, or loin. Lean pork cuts include tenderloin or loin chop. Bake or broil foods instead of frying. Skim off fat from meat during cooking. Go easy on seasoning. Most seasonings are OK as long as they are not spicy but should be used in moderation. Substitute low-fat dairy foods, such as low-fat yogurt, for ice cream. Steam your vegetables with water only. Limit butter, oils, and cream sauces. Use cooking spray instead of cooking oil when sautÃ©ing. Choose low-fat or nonfat ingredients over full-fat products. Get creative. There are all kinds of ways to modify recipes. Don't be afraid to try new things. In addition to making adjustments to what you eat and how you cook, changing certain habits may lessen heartburn symptoms too, including: Do not overeat. Instead, eat small, frequent meals. And take your time. Eating fast can make heartburn symptoms worse. Avoid lying down or going to sleep for at least three hours after a meal. Do not bend over right after eating. Do not smoke. Lose weight, if necessary. Wear loose-fitting clothes so as to not add extra pressure on your stomach. Raise the head of your bed 6 to 8 inches with wood blocks or some other sturdy objects. Propping your head up with pillows probably won't give you the relief you need. \u001b[92m[3] If these diet and lifestyle tips don't help, or you need additional relief, over-the-counter antacids and acid-reducing or blocking drugs may help control your heartburn symptoms\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[4] Talk to your doctor to learn more about over-the-counter or prescription medications to treat your symptoms\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[5] Surgery may be needed in rare cases\u001b[0m. Hiatal hernia symptoms can be bothersome. But most people feel better after they adjust their diet and lifestyle.\n",

      "OUTPUT:  Individuals with severe ADHD, who face significant workplace challenges or job instability, may qualify for disability benefits under the Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[92m[2]\u001b[0m.

      "Excellent focus, attention to detail, speed, and organization -- they are all things employers are looking for in employees and job candidates. But when you have ADHD, these and more can be a real challenge. It can make it tough to excel at work and sometimes even keep a job. You may feel restless or not be able to focus -- classic parts of having the disorder. But there are things you can do to help you get a job and thrive despite your ADHD. Sometimes it can be an asset. An estimated 8 million to 9 million American adults have ADHD. And many other people in similar situations struggle on the job. One national survey showed that only half of adults with ADHD were able to hold down a full-time job, compared to 72% of adults without the disorder. When they were able to secure a job, they tended to earn less than their peers without it. Those job problems translate into nearly $77 billion in lost income each year. How much ADHD affects your job outlook depends on how severe your condition is. Some people \u001b[92m[1] may just have trouble staying on task, while others can't make it through the workday without getting into a huge blow-up with a boss or co-worker\u001b[0m. Some people who are \u001b[92m[2] more severely affected can lose their job, wind up bouncing from job to job, or need to seek disability benefits\u001b[0m. ADHD affects job performance in a number of ways. If you can't sit still and have trouble with organization and focus, you may find meetings excruciating. Keeping track of multiple projects and deadlines is enormously challenging. One study showed that people with ADHD often had more trouble with attention, working memory, mental processing, and verbal fluency. These are all called executive-function abilities that are important in the workplace. If you have ADHD, it may be hard to: Manage time Get and stay organized Listen and pay attention Follow directions Complete assignments Attend to details Get to work on time Speak just when it's your turn Sit still Keep emotions under control You may also have trouble with: Anger Procrastination ADHD often leads to depression and low self-esteem. When you can't make deadlines and aren't able to complete your work on schedule, it can make these feelings worse. Many adults who are restless, aren't able to concentrate, or have other symptoms have never been formally diagnosed with ADHD. If you have any of the problems listed above, the first step should be to see a doctor who specializes in the treatment of adult ADHD. They can talk to you to see if you do have it. And if you do, diagnose you so that you can get started on the right treatment plan. People have success with medication, therapy, or both. There are also organizational strategies you can learn from a coach or occupational therapist and then practice. If you are about to start a job search, work with a career counselor to find a job that best matches your interests, needs, and abilities. That might want to find a more fast-paced job with flexible hours and a less-rigid structure. Or you may want to start your own business so that you can design your own work environment and hours. Once you have a job, try these: Find peace. Ask to work in a quiet space where you won't be easily distracted. Buddy up. Work with a manager or colleague who is well-organized and can help guide you through projects from start to completion. Book it. Keep a day planner with a calendar and list of things to do. Update them often. Set up your PDA or computer to send you electronic reminders for meetings and due dates. Write it down. Take notes at meetings and during phone conversations, and add all new tasks to your to-do list. Schedule interruptions. Set aside specific periods of time each day for answering voice mail and email so that they won't interrupt your other responsibilities. Set realistic goals. Break up your days into a series of individual assignments, and only try to tackle one task at a time. Use a timer to let you know when to move on to the next task. Reward yourself. When you complete an assignment or follow through on these organizational tricks, find a way to reward yourself. Take a break to go for a walk. Read a magazine article. For big goals, go out for a special lunch or get yourself something you've been wanting. Delegate. If you can, get an assistant or intern to take care of the small details to free you up so you can focus on the big picture. Relax, and make it a habit. Practice relaxation techniques. They can help with concentration. Try mediation or deep breathing. Get up once an hour and take a walk, get a drink of water, or talk to a co-worker. To help you adjust to your job, enlist the help of a career counselor or executive coach. He or she can offer you guidance on any issues you encounter. They can also help you work through the job situations that you find most troublesome. For example, they could help you role play how to discuss a pay raise with your boss without the conversation becoming emotionally charged. Because ADHD is considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, \u001b[92m[3] if you work at a larger company, they can't discriminate against you on the basis of your condition\u001b[0m. The act also requires your company to \u001b[92m[4] accommodate your needs\u001b[0m. But you have to be comfortable enough to let your employer know that you have ADHD. It may be best to research this topic more before bringing it up so you have a plan. Finally, take advantage of the benefits -- yes, there are benefits -- that can come with ADHD. The restlessness, impulsiveness, and constant desire to try new things can be great assets. This is especially true if you have your own business. Studies have shown that many adults with ADHD wind up as entrepreneurs. The trick to success is to find a career that best suits you. Then use your energy, creativity, and other strengths to get the most out of your job.\n",

      "Ah, the joys of summer: The withering heat and school vacations, when your kids give you minute-to-minute updates on their boredom levels. Isn't summer supposed to be fun and relaxing? If you've got summer depression, it isn't. For some people, summer depression has a biological cause, says Ian A. Cook, MD, the director of the Depression Research Program at UCLA. For others, the particular stresses of summer can pile up and make them feel miserable. Especially hard is that you feel like you're supposed to be having a great time. Everyone else seems so happy splashing in the water and sweating in their lawn chairs. So why can't you? And more importantly, what can you do to make this summer easier? Here's what you need to know about summer depression. Why do some people feel more depressed in summer? Here's a rundown of reasons. \u001b[92m[1] Summertime SAD\u001b[0m. You've probably heard about seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, which \u001b[92m[2] affects about 4% to 6% of the U. S. population\u001b[0m. SAD typically causes depression as the days get shorter and colder. But about 10% of people with SAD get it in the reverse -- \u001b[92m[3] the onset of summer triggers their depression symptoms\u001b[0m. Cook notes that some studies have shown that in countries near the equator â such as India â summer SAD is more common than winter SAD. Why do seasonal changes cause depression? Experts aren't sure, but \u001b[92m[4] the longer days, and increasing heat and humidity\u001b[0m may play a role. Specific symptoms of summer depression often include loss of appetite, trouble \u001b[92m[11] sleep\u001b[0ming, weight loss, and anxiety. \u001b[92m[5] Disrupted schedules in summer\u001b[0m. If you've had depression before, you probably know that having a reliable routine is often key to staving off symptoms. But during the summer, routine goes out the window â and that disruption can be stressful, Cook says. If you have children in grade school, you're suddenly faced with the prospect of keeping them occupied all day, every day. If your kids are in college, you may suddenly find them â and all their boxes of stuff â back in the house after a nine-month absence. Vacations can disrupt your work, \u001b[92m[11] sleep\u001b[0m, and eating habits â all of which can all contribute to summer depression. \u001b[92m[6] Body image issues\u001b[0m. As the temperature climbs and the layers of clothing fall away, a lot of people feel terribly self-conscious about their bodies, says Cook. Feeling embarrassed in shorts or a bathing suit can make life awkward, not to mention hot. Since so many summertime gatherings revolve around beaches and pools, some people start avoiding social situations out of embarrassment. \u001b[92m[7] Financial worries\u001b[0m. Summers can be expensive. There's the vacation, of course. And if you're a working parent, you may have to fork over a lot of money to summer camps or babysitters to keep your kids occupied while you're on the job. The expenses can add to a feeling of summer depression. â This summer, we have worries about the economic crisis layered on top of everything else,â says Cook. â People are feeling more financially strapped. They're wondering, â If I go on vacation, will the job still be there when I get back? 'â \u001b[92m[8] The heat\u001b[0m. Lots of people relish the sweltering heat. They love baking on a beach all day. But for the people who don't, summer heat can become truly oppressive. You may start spending every weekend hiding out in your air-conditioned bedroom, watching Pay- Per- View until your eyes ache. You may begin to skip your usual before-dinner walks because of the humidity. You may rely on unhealthy takeout because it's just too stifling to cook. Any of these things can contribute to summer depression. What can help you feel better? What can you do to make this summer different? Here are some tips on taking control of summer depression. \u001b[92m[9] Get help\u001b[0m. It's simple. If you think you're getting depressed, no matter what time of year, get help. Talk to a therapist, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Or see your general medical doctor or a psychiatrist who can evaluate whether medicines for depression might be appropriate. Never take the signs of depression lightly. Don't wait them out, assuming they'll resolve. Sometimes, what started as summer depression can turn into a longer-lasting bout of major depression, Cook tells Web MD. And even if your depression will resolve in September, that's no reason to ignore it in June. We're talking about three months of potentially avoidable misery. â A temporary depression can still be pretty awful,â says Cook. While the symptoms lift in a few months, the impact on your family and job can be permanent. \u001b[92m[10] Plan ahead\u001b[0m. Cook says there's one advantage to a summer depression: you know when it's coming. June is right there on the calendar. So if you're feeling OK in the spring, think about the specific aspects of your life that become difficult during the summer. What will help prevent summer depression? What's the best way to take time off from work? Would signing up the kids for summer programs or camp help relieve your stress? You'll feel a lot more in control heading into the summer if you have plans in place. Sleep. Vacations, summer barbecues, the short nights â they can all encourage you to stay up later than usual. But not getting enough \u001b[92m[11] sleep\u001b[0m is a common trigger for depression. So make a concerted effort to get to bed on time. \u001b[92m[12] Keep up with your exercise\u001b[0m. Many studies have found that regular physical activity can help keep depression at bay. So even if it's getting too hot for your normal activities, find other ways to stay active and head off summer depression. \u001b[92m[14] Start earlier in the morning or later in the evening, when it's not so hot\u001b[0m. Consider \u001b[92m[15] fitness equipment for the cool basement\u001b[0m. If an annual membership to a gym is too expensive, consider joining one for a couple of months just to get you through the summer. \u001b[92m[13] Don't overdo dieting and fitness\u001b[0m. Don't kick off the summer with a frenzy of dieting and exercise in order to fit into last year's bathing suit. It's bound to make you unhappy and anxious. Instead, exercise sensibly and eat moderately. If you try an insanely restrictive diet, you probably won't be able to keep it up. And that âfailureâ will just leave you more demoralized and worsen your summer depression. Protect yourself. Don't let obligations drag you down. Maybe you always host the enormous family barbecue on Memorial Day or the July 4 picnic. But if you're feeling overwhelmed, give it a pass this year. Ask another relative to host. Don't risk pushing yourself into a summer depression just to live up to tradition. Think about why. If you struggle with summer depression year after year, ask yourself if there's a reason. Do you associate summer with a difficult time in the past â the death of a loved one or the break-up of a relationship? Have you had previous bouts of depression during the summer? Without even realizing it, you may have started to associate the summer with sadness â an association that gets stronger every summer that you spend depressed. If you do have some unhappy connection with the summer, sorting it out could help you break the cycle. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your medication. If you're on medicine for depression, and you find that summer â year after year â makes your depression worse, talk to your doctor about changing your dosage. Maybe he or she could up your dose in the late spring and taper it back down in the fall. It could really help head off summer depression problems, Cook says. \u001b[92m[16] Plan your vacation carefully\u001b[0m. Before you book your plane tickets or load up your car's roof rack for your annual summer vacation, ask yourself this: Is this what you really want? Or is it an obligation you're fulfilling to a relative? Will it make you happy? Or will it stretch your finances, stress you out, and make you fall behind at work? Consider alternatives. Instead of taking a whole week off at once, might it be better to take off several long weekends spread out through the summer? Would taking time off but staying at home â a â\u001b[92m[17] staycation\u001b[0mâ â be more relaxing? Don't get locked into a vacation that won't feel like a vacation. Don't beat yourself up. One thing that's hard about summer depression is that you feel so out of step. Everyone else seems to be having such a swell time. You aren't. You keep asking yourself, â What's wrong with me?â Try not to think that way. â So much of our misery grows out of the gap between where we are and where we think we ought to be,â says Cook. So stop worrying about how you feel relative to other people. Stop assuming that you're supposed to be happy just because the calendar says it's June. Instead, concentrate on what's triggering your summer depression and how you can overcome it. â Treatments do work,â says Cook. â Psychotherapy or medication can blunt the effects of a seasonal depression. Summers really don't have to be so bad.â\n",

She was a granddaughter of Norman Forbes-Robertson and great-niece of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson. After making her stage debut with her father's touring company in 1929 she progressed via provincial repertory to the West End, where she appeared continually from the 1930s to the 1970s. She \u001b[92m[2] married the actor Ralph Richardson in 1944\u001b[0m, and the couple regularly appeared together in London, and on tour in the UK, continental Europe, Australia and North and South America.

      "\u001b[96m[3] Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor\u001b[0m who, along with his contemporaries Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of 'Hamlet' in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including 'The HeiressHome at Seven', and 'Three Sisters'. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays. Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including 'Things to Come' (1936), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962) and 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for 'The Heiress' (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film,  (1984). Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical. \n",

      "Asthma attacks (worsening of asthma symptoms) can be triggered by allergies, which can temporarily increase the inflammation of the airways in a susceptible person. An allergy is the immune system's reaction when exposed to what is otherwise a harmless substance, such as plant pollen, mold, or animal hair, skin or saliva. The immune system acts as a body defense, yet for people with allergies, the immune system treats these substances, called \"allergens,\" as if they are harmful, causing a disruption to normal body functions. Allergens are what trigger a series of reactions by the immune system during an allergic reaction. Inhaled Allergens. The most important allergens for people with allergic asthma appear to be those asthma triggers that are inhaled. Hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs when a person comes in contact with an allergen or a substance that he or she is sensitive to. Common inhaled allergens include: Animal dander (skin, saliva) Dust mites Cockroach particles Mold Pollen Medical experts recommend that all people with allergies and asthma try to identify possible inhaled allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms. Food Allergies. Food allergies rarely cause asthma yet they can cause a severe life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. The condition can lead to symptoms that include difficulty breathing, wheezing, an itchy rash, low blood pressure, and vomiting. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, walnuts) Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Food preservatives can also trigger allergic and asthmatic reactions. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and may be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods If you suspect that certain foods may be the cause of your asthma, discuss this with your doctor. Allergy skin testing can be done to determine if you are allergic to these foods. \u001b[92m[1] If you have allergies and asthma, avoid the substance you are allergic to\u001b[0m. Here are some tips to help you avoid some of the most common allergens and prevent asthma attack symptoms. Dust Mites Encase pillows, mattresses, and box springs with allergen-proof, zippered covers. Wash all bedding in hot water once a week. Non-carpeted flooring is best. If you cannot get rid of your carpeting, vacuum often with an HEPA filter. Wear a mask while vacuuming. If your child has asthma, do not vacuum while he or she is in the room. Products that eliminate dust mites from carpeting (such as Acarosan) can be purchased. Your asthma care provider can give you information about these products. Avoid curtains and drapes. Use plain window shades instead of mini-blinds. Washable curtains should be washed in hot water every two to four weeks. Dust all surfaces with a damp cloth often, including lampshades and windowsills. Keep clutter under control. Toys and books should be stored in enclosed bookshelves, drawers or closets. Replace traditional stuffed animals with washable stuffed animals. Keep all clothing in drawers and closets. Keep drawers and closets closed. Cover air ducts with filters. Change these when soiled. Pillows and bedding should not contain feathers. Keep indoor humidity low (below 50%). Use a dehumidifier if needed. Regularly change filters on heaters and air conditioners. Mold and Mildew Air out damp, humid areas frequently. Run a dehumidifier to keep humidity between 35% and 45%. Use air conditioners when possible. Clean bathrooms regularly using products that kill and prevent mold. Use exhaust fans to vent steam. Do not carpet the bathroom. Keep indoor plants out of bedrooms. When painting, add mold inhibitor to paint to prevent mold from growing. Avoid sources of outdoor molds, such as wet leaves or garden debris. To clean visible mold use a cleaning solution containing bleach ( one ounce per quart of water). Insects Many homes and apartments have cockroaches and other insects. Some people with asthma are allergic to a protein in their droppings. To control these allergens in your home: Use roach baits or traps. Insect sprays can be used, but should only be sprayed when no one is at home. Before you or your child returns home after spraying, make sure that your home has been aired out for a couple of hours. Because cockroaches thrive in high humid environment, fix water leaks in and around your home. Cover food in lidded or sealed containers. Clean dishes after eating. Sweep floors after you have eaten. Pollen Pollen is a tiny egg shaped cell from flowering plants. Pollens are difficult to avoid because they cannot be eliminated from the atmosphere. Plants have different periods of pollination, which varies little from year to year. Yet, the type of weather affects the amount of pollen in the air with hot, dry, and windy weather causing more pollen in the air. In general pollen season starts from February to October. You can lessen your or your child's exposure to pollen by: Limiting your or your child's outdoor activities during times of high pollen, such as early morning. Having him wear a hat outdoors, washing his hands and face when he comes inside, and having him change his clothes after being outside. Staying indoors during dry or windy days when pollen counts are high. Keeping windows closed during pollen seasons. Using air conditioning if possible. Pet Dander It is best not to own any pets if you or your child is highly allergic to pet dander. Long visits to friends and family who own pets should be avoided. If you do visit, make sure you or your child takes asthma or allergy medicines before the visit. Exposure to the pets should be kept to a minimum when visiting. If you must have a cat or dog in the home, restrict its living area. It should not be allowed in your or your child's bedroom at any time. If possible, keep the pet outside. Wash your pet weekly. Remove as much carpeting as possible. Animal dander deposits in the carpet and stays there, even after the pet is gone from the home. Food Allergies If you have allergies, avoiding food triggers can be challenging. It is important to always read food labels and, when dining out, ask how foods are prepared. \u001b[92m[2] Consider Allergy Shots\u001b[0m \u001b[92m[3] You can train your immune system to not overreact to allergy triggers\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[4] Doctors do this by giving you allergy shots (immunotherapy) for asthma\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[5] An allergy shot is a small amount of the substance that causes your allergy\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[6] By giving repeated shots of the substance over a period of time, your immune system eventually stops causing the allergic reaction\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[7] Ask your doctor if you are a candidate for allergy shots for preventing asthma\u001b[0m.\n",

      "A Baker's cyst is a fluid-filled sac behind your knee. It often causes a bulge and a feeling of tightness. You might hear your doctor call it a popliteal cyst. They might not cause any symptoms, but symptoms of a Baker's cyst may include: Swelling behind your knee Swelling in your leg Knee pain Stiffness -- you won't be able to bend your knee Causes of a Baker's cyst may include: Swelling in the knee . This happens when the fluid that lubricates your knee joint increases. When pressure builds up, fluid squeezes into the back of the knee and creates the cyst. Arthritis. People with all forms of arthritis often have Baker's cysts. Injury. A sports-related injury or other blow to the knee can cause A Baker's cyst. Gout . This a type of arthritis, which results from the buildup of uric acid in the blood, can lead to a Baker's cyst. See your doctor if you have any of the symptoms listed above and they're causing problems. They'll examine you to rule out conditions that are more serious, like a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis). He may also order an imaging test, like an ultrasound or MRI, to get a better look. You may not need any treatment for a Baker's cyst. They aren't dangerous and tend to go away on their own. In the meantime, try these at-home remedies to ease your pain and make yourself more comfortable: Keep it cold. Apply a cold pack to the affected area. It'll help keep the swelling down. A compression wrap might also help. Relieve pain. For pain (and to reduce inflammation), take an over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen. Rest your leg. Keep it raised above your heart level when possible. This will keep down swelling. Use a cane or crutch when you walk to keep pressure off your leg. If these at-home treatments don't work, see your doctor. They may recommend one of the following: Steroids . These can help reduce inflammation. Aspiration. Your doctor can drain the cyst. They'll likely do it with the aid of an ultrasound. This treatment may not work if your case is severe. Surgery. If you're in serious pain or if the cyst makes it hard for you to move your knee, this might be an option. But it'll only work if your doctor also treats the issue that caused the Baker's cyst to begin with, such as arthritis. Exercise. A physical therapist can teach you gentle exercises to help improve your range of motion and strengthening moves to build up the muscles around your knee. This could ease your symptoms. RICE: Rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Rest the joint when you can, use a compression bandage, apply ice, and raise your knee, especially at night. If your leg turns red or starts to swell, see your doctor right away. This could mean your Baker's cyst has burst. Possibly -- by \u001b[92m[1] preventing knee injuries in the first place\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[2] Wear the right shoes when you work out\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[3] Be sure to warm up before you exercise\u001b[0m. And \u001b[92m[4] if you do get a knee injury, take care of it right away\u001b[0m. See your doctor if it doesn't get better. Sometimes, the cysts break open.

      "Caregiver burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion that may be accompanied by a change in attitude -- from positive and caring to negative and unconcerned. Burnout can occur when caregivers don't get the help they need, or if they try to do more than they are able -- either physically or financially. Caregivers who are \"burned out\" may experience fatigue, stress, anxiety, and depression. Many caregivers also feel guilty if they spend time on themselves rather than on their ill or elderly loved ones. The symptoms of caregiver burnout are similar to the symptoms of stress and depression. They may include: Withdrawal from friends and family Loss of interest in activities previously enjoyed Feeling blue, irritable, hopeless, and helpless Changes in appetite, weight, or both Changes in sleep patterns Getting sick more often Feelings of wanting to hurt yourself or the person for whom you are caring Emotional and physical exhaustion Excessive use of alcohol and/or sleep medications Irritability Call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 if you think you might hurt yourself or anyone else. Caregivers often are so busy caring for others that they tend to neglect their own emotional, physical, and spiritual health. The demands on a caregiver's body, mind, and emotions can easily seem overwhelming, leading to fatigue and hopelessness -- and, ultimately, burnout. Other factors that can lead to caregiver burnout include: Role confusion -- Many people are confused when thrust into the role of caregiver. It can be difficult for a person to separate her role as caregiver from her role as spouse, lover, child, friend, etc. Unrealistic expectations -- Many caregivers expect their involvement to have a positive effect on the health and happiness of the patient. This may be unrealistic for patients suffering from a progressive disease, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Lack of control -- Many caregivers become frustrated by a lack of money, resources, and skills to effectively plan, manage, and organize their loved one's care. Unreasonable demands -- Some caregivers place unreasonable burdens upon themselves, in part because they see providing care as their exclusive responsibility. Other factors -- Many caregivers cannot recognize when they are suffering burnout and eventually get to the point where they cannot function effectively. They may even become sick themselves. Here are some steps you can take to help prevent caregiver burnout: Find someone you trust -- such as a friend, co-worker, or neighbor -- to talk to about your feelings and frustrations. Set realistic goals, accept that you may need help with caregiving, and turn to others for help with some tasks. Be realistic about your loved one's disease, especially if it is a progressive disease such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Don't forget about yourself because you're too busy caring for someone else. Set aside time for yourself, even if it's just an hour or two. Remember, taking care of yourself is not a luxury; it is an absolute necessity if you're going to be an effective caregiver. Talk to a professional. Most therapists, social workers, and clergy members are trained to counsel individuals dealing with a wide range of physical and emotional issues. Take advantage of respite care services. Respite care provides a temporary break for caregivers. This can range from a few hours of in-home care to a short stay in a nursing home or assisted living facility. Know your limits and do a reality check of your personal situation. Recognize and accept your potential for caregiver burnout. Educate yourself. The more you know about the illness, the more effective you will be in caring for the person with the illness. Develop new tools for coping. Remember to lighten up and accentuate the positive. Use humor to help deal with everyday stresses. Stay healthy by eating right and getting plenty of exercise and sleep. Accept your feelings. Having negative feelings -- such as frustration or anger -- about your responsibilities or the person for whom you are caring is normal. It does not mean you are a bad person or a bad caregiver. If you are already suffering from stress and depression, seek medical attention. Stress and depression are treatable disorders. If you want to help prevent burnout, consider turning to the following resources for help with your caregiving: Home health services -- These agencies provide home health aids and nurses for short-term care, if your loved one is acutely ill. Some agencies provide short-term respite care. Adult day care-- These programs offer \u001b[92m[1] a place for seniors to socialize, engage in a variety of activities, and receive needed medical care and other services\u001b[0m. Nursing homes or assisted living facilities -- These institutions sometimes offer short-term respite stays to provide caregivers \u001b[92m[2] a break from their caregiving responsibilities\u001b[0m. Private care aides -- These are professionals who specialize in assessing current needs and coordinating care and services.

      "The Constitution does not explicitly require the speaker to be an incumbent member of the House of Representatives, although every speaker thus far has been, and as a member the speaker also represents their district and retains the right to vote. The speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the vice president and ahead of the president pro tempore of the Senate. The 56th and current Speaker of the House is Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana. Selection The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress, biennially, after a general election, or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position during a congressional term. \u001b[92m[1] At the start of a new Congress, those voting to elect the speaker are representatives-elect, as a speaker must be selected before members are sworn in to office; the House of Representatives cannot organize or take other legislative actions until a speaker is elected\u001b[0m. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. In practice, each party's caucus or conference selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. \u001b[92m[2] To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of votes from the members present and voting\u001b[0m. If no candidate wins a majority, the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Representatives are free to vote for someone other than the candidate nominated by their party but generally do not, as the outcome of the election effectively demonstrates which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House. Representatives who choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominee usually vote for someone else in their party or vote 'present', in which case their vote does not count in tallying the vote positively or negatively. Anyone who votes for the other party's candidate could face serious consequences, as was the case when Democrat James Traficant voted for Republican Dennis Hastert in 2001 (107th Congress). In response, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority, and he lost all of his committee posts. Upon election, the new speaker is sworn in by the dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member. Additionally, it is customary for the outgoing speaker, or the minority leader, to hand the speaker's gavel to the new speaker, as a mark of the peaceful transition of power. Eligibility of non-members While every speaker of the House has been a sitting House member, Article I, Section II, Clause 5, of the U.S. Constitution, concerning the choosing of a speaker, does not explicitly state House membership as a requirement. As noted by the Congressional Research Service, non-members have, on multiple occasions since 1997, received votes in speaker elections. In 1787, while the proposed Constitution was being considered, Pennsylvania Congress of the Confederation Delegate Tench Coxe publicly wrote the following: The house of representatives is not, as the Senate, to have a president chosen for them from without their body, but are to elect their speaker from their own number . . . . \n",

      "When the House convenes on the first day of a new Congress, it must first establish that there are enough Members-elect to achieve a quorum, the constitutionally mandated minimum number that must be present to conduct business. The second item of business—even before Members are sworn in—is the election of a Speaker. Until a Speaker is elected, the Clerk from the previous Congress presides over the House. The Clerk calls for nominations for Speakership candidates, and the chairs of the Republican Conference and Democratic Caucus make short speeches on behalf of their parties’ nominees. The Clerk then asks for any other nominations to be brought forward. Then the Clerk appoints tellers from among the Members-elect to record the votes, and the voting begins. \u001b[102m[3] Each Member-elect has the opportunity to vote when the Clerk calls his or her name\u001b[0m. Typically, the Member-elect responds by calling out the last name of the person they wish to be Speaker. They may also answer 'present,' a response that does not count as a vote for anyone but does contribute to a quorum. Or they could decline to respond at all, in which case they would be considered not voting. (The forgoing is a description of what usually occurs at the beginning of a Congress. Extraordinary circumstances may vary these proceedings. An extensive treatment of the process of electing a Speaker, including information about unusual events, is available in the Precedents of the United States House of Representatives.) The vote for Speaker is a rare instance where a verbal roll call is made of each Member.  The House usually records its votes by electronic means, which saves a lot of time and allows Members to vote at any time during the 15-17 minutes usually reserved for a roll call.  But the Speaker’s election is different, partly by tradition, but also because it is not a yes or no vote. In 2019, the Speakership vote took a little shy of 50 minutes, plus additional time to tally the result. To win the Speakership, a person must secure a simple majority of those present and voting. If each of the 435 Representatives-elect votes for a candidate, the majority would be 218. For each person who answers present or otherwise does not vote, the threshold to win a majority decreases. In effect, the threshold decreases by a vote for every two people who answer present or do not participate. So if 433 Members vote, a candidate would need 217 votes to win the Speakership. \n",

It helps in identifying issues such as blood vessel damage, brain injuries, cancer, and strokes in the brain and spinal cord, heart diseases, and blockages in blood vessels. MRIs are also valuable for assessing the health of organs like the liver, kidneys, and in gender-specific screenings such as breast and prostate exams. Additionally, functional MRIs (fMRIs) are crucial for mapping brain activity, aiding in the detection of brain problems and planning surgeries for conditions like epilepsy and tumors \u001b[92m[6]\u001b[0m\u001b[92m[7]\u001b[0m.\n",

      "Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is a test that uses powerful magnets, radio waves, and a computer to make detailed pictures inside your body. Your doctor can use this test to diagnose you or to see how well you've responded to treatment. Unlike X-rays and computed tomography ( CT) scans, MRIs do not use the damaging ionizing radiation of X-rays. A MRI \u001b[92m[1] helps a doctor diagnose a disease or injury, and it can monitor how well you're doing with a treatment\u001b[0m. MRIs can be done on different parts of your body. It's \u001b[92m[2] especially useful for looking at soft tissues and the nervous system\u001b[0m. A MRI of the brain and spinal cord looks for: Blood vessel damage Brain injury Cancer Multiple sclerosis Spinal cord injuries Stroke A MRI of the heart and blood vessels looks for: Blocked blood vessels Damage caused by a heart attack Heart disease Problems with the structure of the heart A MRI of the bones and joints looks for: Bone infections Cancer Damage to joints Disc problems in the spine Neck or low back pain with nerve signs MRIs can also be done to check the health of these organs: Breasts (women) Liver Kidneys Ovaries (women) Pancreas Prostate (men) A special kind of MRI called a functional MRI (f MRI\u001b[92m[6] ) maps brain activity. This test looks at\u001b[0m blood flow in your brain to see which areas become active when you do certain tasks. A f MRI \u001b[92m[7] can detect brain problems, such as the effects of a stroke, or for brain mapping if you need brain surgery for epilepsy or tumors\u001b[0m. Your doctor can use this test to plan your treatment. Before your MRI, let your doctor know if you: Have any health problems, such as kidney or liver disease Recently had surgery Have any allergies to food or medicine, or if you have asthma Are pregnant, or might be pregnant No metal is allowed in the MRI room, because the magnetic field in the machine can attract metal. Tell your doctor whether you have any metal-based devices that might cause problems during the test. These can include: Artificial heart valves Body piercings Cochlear implants Drug pumps Fillings and other dental work Implanted nerve stimulator Insulin pump Metal fragments, such as a bullet or shrapnel Metal joints or limbs Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) Pins or screws If you have tattoos, talk with your doctor. Some inks contain metal On the day of the test, wear loose, comfortable clothing that doesn't have snaps or other metal fasteners. You might need to take off your own clothes and wear a gown during the test. Remove all of these before you go into the MRI room: Cell phone Coins Dentures Eyeglasses Hearing aids Keys Underwire bra Watch Wig If you don't like enclosed spaces or you're nervous about the test, tell your doctor. You may be able to have an open MRI or get medicine to relax you before the test. A typical MRI machine is a large tube with a hole at both ends. A magnet surrounds the tube. You lie on a table that slides all the way into the tube. In a short-bore system, you are not totally inside the MRI machine. Only the part of your body that's being scanned is inside. The rest of your body is outside the machine. An open MRI is open on all sides. This type of machine may be best if you have claustrophobia -- a fear of tight spaces -- or you're very overweight. The quality of images from some open MRI machines isn't as good as it is with a closed MRI. Before some MRIs, you'll get contrast dye into a vein in your arm or hand. This dye helps the doctor more clearly see structures inside your body. The dye often used in MRIs is called gadolinium. It can leave a metal taste in your mouth. You will lie on a table that slides into the MRI machine. Straps might be used to hold you still during the test. Your body might be completely inside the machine. Or, part of your body may stay outside the machine. The MRI machine creates a strong magnetic field inside your body. A computer takes the signals from the MRI and uses them to make a series of pictures. Each picture shows a thin slice of your body. You might hear a loud thumping or tapping sound during the test. This is the machine creating energy to take pictures inside your body. You can ask for earplugs or headphones to muffle the sound. You might feel a twitching sensation during the test. This happens as the MRI stimulates nerves in your body. It's normal, and nothing to worry about. The MRI scan should take between 20 and 90 minutes. Pregnant women should not get a MRI during their first trimester unless they absolutely need the test. The first trimester is when the baby's organs develop. You also shouldn't get contrast dye when you're pregnant. Don't get contrast dye if you've had an allergic reaction to it in the past or you have severe kidney disease. Certain people with metal inside their body can't get this test, including those with: Some clips used to treat brain aneurysms Pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators Cochlear implants Certain metal coils placed in blood vessels A specially trained doctor called a radiologist will read the results of your MRI and send the report to your doctor. Your doctor will explain the meaning of your test results and what to do next.\n",

      "Each year, between 5% and 20% of Americans get the flu and miss a staggering 70 million work days as a result. The costs? Roughly $10.4 billion in direct costs for hospitalizations and outpatient visits for adults. Both the flu shot and the nasal flu vaccine work really well to keep you from getting ill. But they aren't 100% effective. You can still get sick even if you get vaccinated, although it's usually less severe and goes away more quickly. Try these five tips to lower your risk of sharing cold and flu viruses at work. 1. \u001b[92m[1] Call in sick when you need to\u001b[0m. Viruses are easy to spread in close quarters like offices. Stay home if you have any of these symptoms: Fever Headache Extreme tiredness Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle aches Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea 2. \u001b[92m[2] Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough\u001b[0m . Viruses are mostly spread through mucus. Cover your mouth with the inside of your elbow so you don't cough or sneeze into your hand. 3. \u001b[92m[3] Wash your hands often with soap and warm water\u001b[0m. Rub them together for 15 to 20 seconds. If you can't get to soap and water, use alcohol-based disposable hand wipes or gels. 4. \u001b[92m[4] Don't touch your eyes , nose, or mout\u001b[0mh . Germs are easy to pick up when you touch something with germs and then touch those parts of your face. 5. \u001b[92m[5] Wipe down your desk and other common areas\u001b[0m. Telephones, desks, water fountain handles, microwave door handles, and computer keyboards in offices contain large amounts of germs. The Web MD Cold & Flu Survivor's Guide\n",

      "\u001b[96m[2] Hiram 'Hank' Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician\u001b[0m. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the 'Billboard' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording 'Never Again' and 'Honky Tonkin'' with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released 'Move It on Over', which became a hit, and also joined the 'Louisiana Hayride' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of 'Lovesick Blues' recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were 'Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'', and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'. Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music.

He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others.

      "When you have rheumatoid arthritis ( RA), you expect painful or stiff joints. But did you know RA also can make your bones weaker and more likely to break? That's because RA raises your risk of getting osteoporosis, a condition that makes your bones porous or not as dense and strong as they should be to hold up your weight. When this happens, even a minor slip or tumble can cause a painful crack or fracture. The bones most likely to break are in your hips, spine, and wrists. Osteoporosis is very common, especially as you age. People at higher risk include women, particularly after menopause; people with thin frames; smokers; and people who don't get enough calcium or aren't active. There are reasons RA makes you more likely to get osteoporosis: Inflammation : When you have RA, you have inflammation all over your body, especially in your joints. They can swell and break down. That can weaken your bones around the joints affected by RA, like the joints in your hands. Our bodies are always making new bone to replace bone that breaks down. But RA inflammation breaks this cycle. It speeds up your bone loss and slows the making of new bone to replace it. Your bones get weaker, and that leads to osteoporosis. \u001b[92m[4] Inflammation also may make it harder for your body to absorb nutrients it needs to keep your bones strong, like calcium or vitamin D\u001b[0m. Pain makes you inactive: RA can make you feel stiff, achy, or so tired that you don't feel like getting off the couch. Physical activity, like walking, helps keep your bones strong. If you don't exercise, your bones can get weaker over time. If RA keeps you from being active, you're at higher risk for osteoporosis. Steroid drugs: Corticosteroid drugs like prednisone ( Deltasone) can weaken your bones if you take them for a long time. Some people with RA need to take these medications to help with bad flares of inflammation. The drugs can quickly ease pain and swelling so you can get moving again. But they can make it harder for your body to absorb calcium and vitamin D in your diet. These nutrients help you build strong bones. Your osteoporosis risk is even higher if you're a woman past menopause and have taken steroids for 6 months or more. If you have RA, you can do things to help protect your bones: Get inflammation under control. RA drugs like methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) inhibitors, such as adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab ( Remicade), or infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade, can stop inflammation and reduce your risk of a fracture. TNF inhibitors may even protect you from this damage. Eat and drink for stronger bones. \u001b[92m[1] Get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet to keep bones healthy\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[2] Enjoy low-fat dairy products or dark, leafy green veggies to get calcium from natural sources\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[3] Get vitamin D in egg yolks, ocean fish, and liver\u001b[0m. You may need calcium or vitamin D supplements. Stay active. \u001b[92m[5] Exercise helps you develop flexible joints, stronger muscles, and better balance with RA\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[6] It also can help you protect your bones from osteoporosis because it builds bone mass\u001b[0m. The best activities for this are walking, dancing, climbing, or strength training. Even light exercise, like a short walk, can make your joints feel looser and keep your bones strong. Don't smoke or drink too much. Smoking raises your risk of osteoporosis. It also can cause women to go through menopause and start losing bone mass earlier in life. So if you smoke, quit now. Drinking too much also can make you more likely to lose bone or even to slip and fall. Get bone tests. See your doctor regularly to test for signs of osteoporosis. Some people don't know they have it until they have a painful fracture. A bone-density test can tell you if your bones are starting to weaken (osteopenia). This test uses X-rays to see how much calcium and other bone minerals are in your bones. Your spine, hips, and forearms are the most common areas tested. If you take certain drugs for RA, like steroids, this test can show bone problems early so you can make changes to keep it from getting worse. Ask your doctor about bone-preserving drugs. Medications called bisphosphonates can help stop your bones from breaking down. These include zoledronate ( Reclast) and denosumab ( Prolia, Xgeva). You'll need to take these for a long time, so talk to your doctor to see if they're right for you. Avoid accidents. If you have RA and are at risk for osteoporosis, take extra care not to slip or fall. Physical and occupational therapists can show you safer ways to do daily tasks and how to safely exercise. Yoga, tai chi, or low-impact aerobics may help you stay fit and improve your balance.\n",

      "This operation removes a diseased section of the rectum and sigmoid colon. Doctors use it to treat the following conditions: Cancers of the colon and rectum Some types of noncancerous growths in the colon and rectum Complicated diverticulitis The term \"laparoscopic\" refers to a type of surgery called laparoscopy, in which the surgeon works through very small (5-millimeter to 10-millimeter) \"keyhole\" cuts in the abdomen. A laparoscope is a small telescope-like instrument. Your surgeon will use it in order to see inside you during the operation. There are five main steps to this surgery. First, you'll get general anesthesia so that you're â  asleep.â   Then your surgeon will make a small cut (about half an inch) near your bellybutton and place the laparoscope through it so he can see images from inside you. Once the laparoscope is in place, the surgeon will make five or six more small (5-10 millimeter) cuts to make room for the surgical tools. Your surgeon will need to cut away the diseased section of your sigmoid colon and rectum. But first, he must free this section from what supports it. The bowel is attached to the abdominal wall by a layer of tissue called the mesentery, which also contains the main blood vessels (arteries) that take blood to the left side of the colon and rectum. Your surgeon will cut and close them. Then he'll free the sigmoid colon and part of the rectum from the mesentery, and cut away the diseased tissue. Later, he'll remove this part of the mesentery with the diseased bowel. The surgeon must rejoin the remaining end of the descending colon with the remaining end of the rectum. First, he will detach a part of the healthy descending colon from the mesentery so that he can stretch it toward the rectum. He'll also free the rectum from its mesentery so it can meet the end of the colon. To reduce the risk of cancer cells spreading, the surgeon will wash the rectum with a special solution. The cuts used in laparoscopy are very small, so the surgeon must remove the diseased section of bowel in a special way. He will enlarge one of the cuts and place a bag into your abdominal cavity, put the diseased bowel into the bag, and then pull the bag out of the enlarged cut. To do this, your surgeon will use a special stapling device he places into the rectum. Doctors call this rejoining of the colon and rectum an anastomosis. The stapling device \"fires\" a ring of staples to connect the two ends. The surgeon will check the anastomosis for leaks and rinse out your pelvis. Your surgeon may place a drain into your abdomen for a few days to help you recover after surgery. And he will stitch or tape close all the surgical cuts. \u001b[92m[0] You should avoid heavy lifting and abdominal exercises such as sit-ups for 6 weeks after the surgery.\u001b[0m Apart from that, you should steadily build up your activity level when you get home. Walking is a great exercise choice. It will help your recovery by making you stronger, keeping your blood circulating to prevent blood clots, and helping your lungs remain clear. Did you work out before the surgery? You can get back to exercising when you feel comfortable and your doctor says it's OK. When you go home, you'll be able to eat almost everything except raw fruits and vegetables. You should continue this â  softâ   diet until your post-surgical check-up. If the diet makes you constipated, call your doctor's office for advice.\n",

      "\u001b[92m[0] Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a 1997 film by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris.\u001b[0m It profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, who is a lion tamer; George Mendonça, who created topiaries at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, including giraffes made out of boxwood; Ray Mendez, a hairless mole-rats expert; and Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. \u001b[92m[6] scientist who has designed bug-like robots.\u001b[0m The film's musical score is by composer Caleb Sampson, and is performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. \u001b[92m[4] In 'Fast, Cheap & Out of Control', Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to face the interviewer directly while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience.\u001b[0m \u001b[92m[1] The invention is called the Interrotron.\u001b[0m \u001b[92m[5] His four subjects narrate the film in their own words.\u001b[0m \u001b[92m[2] The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in his other films, 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'.\u001b[0m In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. \u001b[92m[7] The film is extensively cut with scenes from older films and television shows.\u001b[0m The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover's idol Clyde Beatty appears from portions of his film 'Darkest Africa' and a malicious robot appears in scenes from 'Zombies of the Stratosphere'. After using the first moments in the film to establish his characters one by one, with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another, in order to correlate the themes which the four subjects have in common. \u001b[92m[8] The title of the film is a play on the old engineer's adage that out of 'fast,cheap,' and 'reliable,' you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car).\u001b[0m Rodney Brooks, the robot scientist from MIT, wrote a paper in which he speculates that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space, instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring. \u001b[92m[3] The paper was fully titled 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System', and published in the 'Journal of the British Interplanetary Society' in 1989.\u001b[0m The film is available on VHS, DVD; the soundtrack by Caleb Sampson is available on CD. \n",

In 1988, McFerrin noticed a similar poster in the apartment of jazz duo Tuck & Patti in San Francisco,[citation needed] and he was inspired by the expression's charm and simplicity.

Nebulizers are particularly effective in delivering asthma medications to infants and small children and to anyone who has difficulty using an asthma inhaler. It is also convenient when a large dose of an inhaled medication is needed. Nebulized therapy is often called a \"breathing treatment.\" And a variety of medications -- both for immediate relief and maintenance of asthma symptoms -- are available for use with a nebulizer. Nebulizers come in home (tabletop) and portable models. Home nebulizers are larger and must be plugged into an electrical outlet. Portable nebulizers run on batteries -- either disposable or rechargeable -- or can be plugged into a car's cigarette lighter. Smaller, portable units are slightly larger than a deck of cards, so they can be carried in a purse, briefcase, or backpack to be used whenever and wherever you need them. To obtain a nebulizer, you need a prescription from your doctor, or it can be dispensed from your pediatrician's office. ( Oftentimes, a breathing treatment is administered at the doctor's office.) Home nebulizers vary in cost, ranging from about $50 and up, plus the cost of accessories. Portable nebulizers usually cost a little more than home nebulizers. Both are usually covered under the durable medical equipment portion of health insurance policies. But, most insurance companies will require you to work with a specified durable medical equipment supplier. Check with your insurance company before purchasing or renting a nebulizer to ensure it will be covered. Your health care provider should be able to assist you with these arrangements. To use a nebulizer, you will need the following supplies: Air compressor Nebulizer cup Mask or mouthpiece Medication (either unit dose vials or bottles with measuring devices) Compressor tubing Once you have the necessary supplies: Place the air compressor on a sturdy surface that will support its weight. Plug the cord from the compressor into a properly grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet. Before asthma treatment, wash your hands with soap and water and dry completely. Carefully measure medications exactly as you have been instructed and put them into the nebulizer cup. Most medications today come in premeasured unit dose vials so measuring is not necessary. If you do measure, use a separate, clean measuring device for each medication. Assemble the nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece. Connect the tubing to both the aerosol compressor and nebulizer cup. Turn on the compressor to make sure it is working correctly. You should see a light mist coming from the back of the tube opposite the mouthpiece. Sit up straight on a comfortable chair. If the treatment is for your child, he or she may sit on your lap. If you are using a mask, position it comfortably and securely on your or your child's face. If you are using a mouthpiece, place it between your or your child's teeth and seal the lips around it. Take slow, deep breaths. If possible, hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before breathing out. This allows the medication to settle into the airways. Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (an average of 10 minutes). The nebulizer will make a sputtering noise, and the cup will have just a little medication remaining. If dizziness or jitteriness occurs, stop the treatment and rest for about 5 minutes. Continue the treatment, and try to breathe more slowly. If dizziness or jitteriness continues to be a problem with future treatments, inform your health care provider. During the treatment, if the medication sticks to the sides of the nebulizer cup, you may shake the cup to loosen the droplets. Your pediatrician should tell you the frequency of nebulizer use and how long you should use it. You should also be given an asthma action plan that explains which medications to use and when. Using a portable nebulizer is similar to using a home nebulizer, except that you don't need to plug it in. Most models are small enough to hold in your hand during use. Cleaning Cleaning and disinfecting your asthma nebulizer equipment is simple and very important. Proper care prevents infection. Cleaning should be done in a dust- and smoke-free area away from open windows. Follow these instructions when cleaning your nebulizer: After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess water, and let air dry. At the end of each day, the nebulizer cup, mask, or mouthpiece should be washed in warm soapy water using a mild detergent, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to air dry. You do not need to clean the compressor tubing. Every third day, after washing your equipment, disinfect the equipment using either a vinegar/water solution or the disinfectant solution your equipment supplier suggests. To use the vinegar solution, mix 1/2 cup white vinegar with 1 1/2 cups of water. Soak the equipment for 20 minutes and rinse well under a steady stream of water. Shake off the excess water and allow to air dry on a paper towel. Always allow the equipment to completely dry before storing in a plastic, zippered bag. Storing Cover the compressor with a clean cloth when not in use. Keep it clean by wiping it with a clean, damp cloth as needed. Do not put the air compressor on the floor either for treatments or for storage. Medications should be stored in a cool, dry place. Some medications require refrigeration and some require protection from light. Check them often. \u001b[92m[14] If they have changed color or formed crystals, throw them away and replace them with new ones.\u001b[0m Other Tips Always have an extra nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece in case you need it. If you are given a nebulizer treatment in the doctor's office, be sure to ask for the tubing, cup, and mask. Check the air compressor's filter as directed. \u001b[92m[5] Replace or clean according to the directions from your equipment supplier.\u001b[0m\n",

      "By age 65, more than half of us will have X-ray evidence of osteoarthritis, a disease in which the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones at the joints breaks down and bony overgrowth occurs. For many, the result is stiffness and pain in the joint. \u001b[92m[2] Although osteoarthritis (or OA) is more common as we age, it is not an inevitable part of aging.\u001b[0m As researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis, they are able to offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and lessen its impact on your life. Here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. If you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. If you are overweight, losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. Obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES), a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of Americans, showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. The risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. Being overweight strains the joints, particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees, hips, and joints of the feet, causing the cartilage to wear away. Weight loss of at least 5% of body weight may decrease stress on the knees, hips, and lower back. In a study of osteoarthritis in a population in Framingham, Mass., researchers estimated that overweight women who lost 11 pounds or about two body mass index ( BMI) points, decreased their risk of osteoarthritis by more than 50%, while a comparable weight gain was associated with an increased risk of later developing knee OA. If you already have osteoarthritis, losing weight may help improve symptoms. If the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak, research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. Fortunately, even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles, the quadriceps, can reduce the risk. To strengthen quadriceps, Todd P. Stitik, MD, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, recommends isometric moves and wall slides. To do these, stand with your back to a wall, with feet shoulder-width apart. Then lean back against the wall, placing your feet out in front of you as far as you comfortably can. Bend at the knees, put your hands on your waist, and slide with your spine, maintaining contact with the wall until you reach a sitting position. ( Your knees should not bend more than 90 degrees). Then slowly slide back to your original position. Repeat eight to 10 times. \u001b[92m[18] If fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising, try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers.\u001b[0m Doing so may make it easier to exercise and stay active. The safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints, such as bicycling, swimming, and other water exercise. Light weight lifting is another option, but if you already have osteoarthritis, first speak with your doctor. Suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. Injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. A long-term study of 1,321 graduates of Johns Hopkins Medical School found that people who injured a knee in adolescence or young adulthood were three times more likely to develop osteoarthritis in that knee, compared those who had not suffered an injury. People who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. To avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recommends the following: Avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. Keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. When jumping, land with knees bent. Do warm-up exercises before sports, even less vigorous ones such as golf. Cool down after vigorous sports. Wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. Exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. If you have a joint injury, it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage, such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. Although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis, certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. They include: Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats reduce joint inflammation, while unhealthy fats can increase it. Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils, including walnut, canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, and olive. Vitamin D. A handful of studies has shown that vitamin D supplements decreased knee pain in people with osteoarthritis. Your body makes most of the vitamin D it needs in response to sunlight. You can get more vitamin D in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and herring; vitamin D-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs. If you already have osteoarthritis, these same steps can be useful for reducing pain and other symptoms. In addition, there are many treatments your doctor can recommend or prescribe. \u001b[92m[11] They range from over-the-counter pain relievers to injections of corticosteroids or other compounds and, eventually, surgery to replace the painful, damaged joint.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Before babies learn to talk in a real language -- English, say, or Spanish -- they babble and coo, playing with sound. That's baby talk, and baby talk sounds similar the world over. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } But when will you hear your baby's first words? Critical milestones for a baby learning to talk happen in the first three years of life, when a baby's brain is rapidly developing. During that time, your baby's speech development depends on your \"baby talk\" skills as well as your baby's. The first \"baby talk\" is nonverbal and happens soon after birth. Your baby grimaces, cries, and squirms to express a range of emotions and physical needs, from fear and hunger to frustration and sensory overload. Good parents learn to listen and interpret their baby's different cries. Just when your baby will say those magical first words varies greatly from individual baby to individual baby. But if your baby misses any of the following milestones in speech development, talk to your pediatrician or family doctor about your concerns. Baby Talk Milestones Baby talk at 3 months. At 3 months, your baby listens to your voice, watches your face as you talk, and turns toward other voices, sounds, and music that can be heard around the home. Many infants prefer a woman's voice over a man's. Many also prefer voices and music they heard while they were still in the womb. By the end of three months, babies begin \"cooing\" -- a happy, gentle, repetitive, sing-song vocalization. Baby talk at 6 months. At 6 months, your baby begins babbling with different sounds. For example, your baby may say \"ba-ba\" or \"da-da.\" By the end of the sixth or seventh month, babies respond to their own names, recognize their native language, and use their tone of voice to tell you they're happy or upset. Some eager parents interpret a string of \"da-da\" babbles as their baby's first words -- \"daddy!\" But babbling at this age is usually still made up of random syllables without real meaning or comprehension. Baby talk at 9 months. After 9 months, babies can understand a few basic words like \"no\" and \"bye-bye.\" They also may begin to use a wider range of consonant sounds and tones of voice. Baby talk at 12-18 months. Most babies say a few simple words like \"mama\" and \"dadda\" by the end of 12 months -- and now know what they're saying. They respond to -- or at least understand, if not obey -- your short, one-step requests such as, \" Please put that down.\" Baby talk at 18 months. Babies at this age say several simple words and can point to people, objects, and body parts you name for them. They repeat words or sounds they hear you say, like the last word in a sentence. But they often leave off endings or beginnings of words. For example, they may say \"daw\" for \"dog\" or \"noo-noo's\" for \"noodles.\" Baby talk at 2 years. By age 2, babies string together a few words in short phrases of two to four words, such as \" Mommy bye-bye\" or \"me milk.\" They're learning that words mean more than objects like \"cup\" -- they also mean abstract ideas like \"mine.\" Baby talk at 3 years. By the time your baby is age 3, his or her vocabulary expands rapidly, and \"make-believe\" play spurs an understanding of symbolic and abstract language like \"now,\" feelings like \"sad,\" and spatial concepts like \"in.\" Babies understand what you're saying long before they can clearly speak. Many babies learning to talk use only one or two words at first, even when they understand 25 or more. You can help your baby learn to talk if you: Watch. Your baby may reach both arms up to say she wants to be picked up, hand you a toy to say she wants to play, or push food off her plate to say she's had enough. \u001b[92m[1] Smile, make eye contact, and respond to encourage these early, nonverbal attempts at baby talk.\u001b[0m Listen. Pay attention to your baby's cooing and babbling, and coo and babble those same sounds right back to your baby. Babies try to imitate sounds their parents are making and to vary pitch and tone to match the language heard around them. So be patient and give your baby lots of time to \"talk\" to you. Praise. \u001b[92m[4] Smile and applaud even the smallest or most confusing attempts at baby talk.\u001b[0m Babies learn the power of speech by the reactions of adults around them. Imitate. Babies love to hear their parents' voices. And when parents talk to them it helps speech develop. The more you talk their \"baby talk\" with them, using short, simple but correct words, such as \"dog\" when your baby says \"daw,\" the more babies will keep trying to talk. Elaborate. If your baby points to the table and makes noise, don't just give him more noodles. Instead, point to the noodles and say, \" Do you want some more noodles? These noodles taste good with cheese, don't they?\" Narrate. Talk about what you're doing as you wash, dress, feed, and change your baby -- \" Let's put on these blue socks now\" or \" I'm cutting up your chicken for you\" -- so your baby connects your speech to these objects and experiences. Hang in there. Even when you don't understand what your baby is saying, keep trying. Gently repeat back what you think is being said, and ask if that's right. Keep offering your loving attention so your baby feels rewarded for trying to talk. Let your child lead. During playtime, follow your child's attention and interests to show that communication is a two-way game of talking and listening, leading, and following. Play. Encourage children to play, pretend, and imagine out loud to develop verbal skills as they become toddlers. Read aloud. Lifelong readers come from young children who have plenty of fun, relaxing experiences of being read to out loud. Watch for any sign of a major speech delay in your baby, and talk with your doctor if you sense there's a problem. A speech delay can happen for a number of reasons, but the earlier a speech problem in babies is diagnosed, the more time you'll have to correct it and help your child reach his or her full potential before school age. After consulting with your pediatrician, here are things to do to help with delayed speech: Have a hearing test done. As many as three out of 1,000 newborns have hearing loss, which can cause delayed speech development. Most states require a hearing screening in the hospital right after birth. Take your baby in for a full hearing exam by age 3 months if he or she doesn't pass the initial hearing screening. See a speech-language pathologist. A SLP can diagnose and treat specific speech, language, or voice disorders that delay speech. Treatment may include giving parents tips and games to improve speech problems in babies and improve a child's language skills. Consider developmental screening. Up to 17% of children in the U. S. have a developmental or behavioral disability such as autism spectrum disorder or cognitive disability. Ask your baby's doctor about screening for these developmental problems, which can cause speech delays. What's the first step for babies learning to talk? \u001b[92m[2] Encourage your baby's first words with your frequent cooing, babbling, talking, and singing.\u001b[0m Keep responding positively and showing you care. When it comes to baby talk, that's the best building block.\n",

This led to the Bangladesh Liberation War in March 1971. Yahya Khan was central to the perpetration of Bangladesh genocide, in which around 300,000–3,000,000 Bengalis were killed, and between 200,000 to 400,000 women were raped. In December 1971, Pakistan carried out pre-emptive strikes against the Bengali-allied Indian Army, culminating in the start of the Third India–Pakistan War. The wars resulted in the surrender of the Pakistani armed forces in East Pakistan, and East Pakistan seceded as Bangladesh. After the surrender, Khan resigned from the military command and transferred the presidency to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Khan remained under house surveillance prior to 1979 when he was released by Fazle Haq. Khan died the following year in Rawalpindi and was buried in Peshawar. \n",

Pradyumna then pulled out the powerful Vaishnavastra (Vishnu's weapon), which could be stopped or nullified only by Lord Vishnu himself and killed the fearful demon.\u001b[92m[2] Both Pradyumna and Mayawati, who could travel in the air with their mahamaya, reached his father's capital, Dwaraka. On reaching the palace, his mother\u001b[0m Rukmini, seeing his resemblance to her husband, recognized him as her lost child. Narada turned up at the palace and narrated to everyone the story of how Pradyumna had been abducted by Sambara and how Mayawati had helped him slay the demon.

When you have too little insulin in your body, or when insulin doesn't work right in your body, you can have diabetes, the condition where you have abnormally high glucose or sugar levels in your blood. Normally when you eat food, glucose enters your bloodstream. Glucose is your body's source of fuel. Your pancreas makes insulin to move glucose from your bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where your body turns it into energy. \u001b[92m[3] People with diabetes have too much blood sugar because their body cannot move glucose into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be changed into and stored for\u001b[0m energy.
