{"ID": 451, "All Sources": ["Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) was a subject and core class taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[16][27] in which students studied and learnt how to defend themselves against all aspects of the Dark Arts, including dark creatures,[24][28][29] curses, hexes and jinxes (dark charms),[25] and duelling.[23] The position of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at the school was once rumoured to be jinxed, as no teacher could hold the post for more than a year without suffering an unpleasant fate. Tom Riddle jinxed the position because Albus Dumbledore did not give him the job when he applied for it.[4] The fact that no teacher has lasted longer than a year meant that the subject had numerous Professors over the years.[23] Ilvermorny began teaching the subject in the 17th century.[16] Harry Potter would occasionally deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts in his adulthood.[30] Contents ", "Defence Against the Dark Arts was a required subject from first year to fifth year.[27][21] In this class, students learned how to cast offencive and protective spells, as well as how to properly handle and deal with dark creatures. The lessons generally had a practical approach, with competent teachers like Remus Lupin correctly believing that when it came to the Dark Arts, a practical approach was the best way,[24][25][23] with theoretical assignments given as homework.[31] Inadequate teachers, such as Quirinus Quirrell and Dolores Umbridge, who were focused on theories alone, hampered the learning of defences, as they would not be providing students any practical experiences.[21][32] ", "Also, due to the course being directly related to the Dark Arts itself, Dark wizards who wished to teach would typically apply for this course, notable examples being Tom Riddle,[4] Patricia Rakepick,[40] Quirinus Quirrell,[41] Bartemius Crouch Junior,[10] Dolores Umbridge,[42] Severus Snape[12] and Amycus Carrow.[43] Jinx on the post[] The curriculum of the class varied greatly depending on what the professor at the time deemed appropriate. Due to the jinx on the teaching post that was present before Lord Voldemort died, many teachers had been appointed to this post, with none of them lasting for more than a single school year.[4] Tom Riddle twice applied for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position, the first time shortly after graduation from Hogwarts when he was turned down by Headmaster Armando Dippet, who claimed he was too young, but invited him to re-apply a few years later.[4] Earlier teachers from the 1985\u20131986 school year for example, were considered highly incompetent and ineffective by most students, and as such, very rarely showed up to teach.[44][45][46][47] Patricia Rakepick teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts to fifth-years During the 1988\u20131989 school year, the renowned Curse-Breaker Patricia Rakepick was appointed as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for that academic year.[5] She proved herself to be a highly effective teacher of both defensive and offensive magic, having taught her students a wide variety of fascinating and useful topics during her lessons, to compensate her students for having learnt almost nothing in previous years. She even gave her select students private lessons in the subject, teaching them how to duel, in preparation for locating the Cursed Vaults throughout the Castle.[5][48][49][50][51][52] [53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] Bill Weasley teaching a group of students DADA in the evening ", "During the 1995\u20131996 school year, the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, had deluded himself with the bizarre conspiracy theory that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore was using the students to create a private army of young witches and wizards to overthrow the Ministry.[73] As such, he implanted Dolores Umbridge to become the teacher of the Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, which he believed to be the main source of training (e.g. defensive spells) for Dumbledore's would-be soldiers.[21] Umbridge 'teaching' Defence Against the Dark Arts ", "When J. K. Rowling was asked why Dumbledore would not give Severus Snape the Defence Against the Dark Arts job, Rowling responded that Dumbledore believed that teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts would bring out Snape's worst side,[117] though Dumbledore finally relented in Harry's sixth year.[118] Snape feigned ignorance when questioned by Hogwarts High Inquisitor Umbridge about Dumbledore's reason for denying him the post,[119] but admitted it to Bellatrix Lestrange during their conversation in Spinner's End.[120] Rowling has also revealed that after Amycus Carrow was the Dark Arts teacher, a permanent teacher took the post because Voldemort's jinx over the job was lifted. ", "each meets Harry before he arrives at Hogwarts in the respective year (with the exception of Mad-Eye Moody, who was only mentioned in passing, although Harry had unknowingly encountered Barty Crouch Jnr at the Quidditch World Cup) and each physically (or magically) attacks Harry during school term, either intentionally or accidentally, as in the case of Remus Lupin. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when discussing who their new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher would be, Harry said that the teachers didn't have much luck: 'One sacked, one dead, one lost his memory, and one was locked in a trunk for nine months,' referring to Lupin, Quirrell, Lockhart, and Moody, respectively; this isn't true, however, because Lupin resigned rather than was fired. Also, Crouch Jnr, the de facto teacher for Harry's fourth year, suffered the Dementor's Kiss. Quirinus Quirrell is the only Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher known to have died during the year he gave the subject. ", "Defense Against the Dark Arts is one of the staple classes Hogwarts students attend throughout the Harry Potter series, and its rotating cast of professors makes it extra intriguing \u2014 here's every one of the Harry Potter Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers explained. The Harry Potter franchise has reached its penultimate success as the Wizarding World produces the Fantastic Beasts spinoff and the long-awaited video game Hogwarts Legacy. The class in question, also known as D.A.D.A., taught students to defend themselves against all kinds of dark magic, including curses, jinxes, and hexes. The curses weren't just limited to the classroom: the D.A.D.A. teaching position itself seemed cursed. No D.A.D.A. professor lasted in the role for longer than a year during Harry's time at Hogwarts. ", "The final contestant on the Harry Potter Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers roster is Amycus Carrow. Amycus Carrow would have been Harry's seventh-year D.A.D.A. teacher had he attended Hogwarts in his final year. Even though Harry didn't experience Carrow's teaching in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2, many of his school friends still did, including Neville Longbottom. While Carrow was professor, he changed the name of the class from 'Defense Against the Dark Arts' to 'The Dark Arts,' the name reflecting the changed content. He and his sister Alecto were in charge of punishment at the school, so he often incorporated that aspect of his role into his teaching. Students in his class were made to practice the Cruciatus curse on students in detention, and if they refused to do so, as Neville did, they were also tortured. ", "Gilderoy Lockhart In 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' noted celebrity wizard Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) makes his way to Hogwarts on the tails of a never-ending ego trip. Despite the mountains of magical memoirs penned in his name, Lockhart is all but incapable of defensive spells. And yet, no one is more convinced of his greatness than he is himself. This leads to one of the most satisfying scenes in the entire Harry Potter film series: the dueling club demonstration in which Snape absolutely decks Lockhart with a single spell. Quirinus Quirrell In 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone,' professor Quirinus Quirrell (Ian Hart), Harry\u2019s first Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, is unique in that, inadvertently or not, he is also the first teacher to try to kill him.

The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's ballots count for 80 percent of the vote tally, while the viewers' ballots make up the other 20 percent. The game's viewing audience can vote on the Internet or by using cellular phones; Media voters are asked to vote with about five minutes remaining in the game, but are allowed to change their mind when the game ends. They can nominate one player from each team, with instructions to count their vote for the player on the winning team. Voters cannot select an entire unit. The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine. Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL. At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to the Super Bowl MVP. Ottis Anderson was the first to win the trophy. The most recent Super Bowl MVP, from Super Bowl LVIII, is Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. ", "The league\u2019s 32 teams are split into two conferences \u2014 the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). The 16 teams in each conference are split into the East, North, South and West divisions; every division has four teams. Every team will play 17 regular-season games with one bye week. Teams will alternate seasons where they host nine regular-season games and one preseason game, or eight regular-season games and two preseason games. The NFC will have nine regular season home games in the 2024 season. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how each team\u2019s opponents are set: Six games against divisional opponents \u2014 two games per team, one at home and one on the road. Four games against teams from a division within its conference \u2014 two games at home and two on the road. Four games against teams from a division in the other conference\u2014 two games at home and two on the road. Two games against teams from the two remaining divisions in its own conference \u2014 one game at home and one on the road. Matchups are based on division ranking from the previous season. The 17th game is an additional game against a non-conference opponent from a division that the team is not scheduled to play. Matchups are based on division ranking from the previous season. Once every team\u2019s opponents are set, the schedule makers begin the process of determining when every game will be played.

Brady has more Super Bowl appearances than every single NFL team besides the Patriots. The Pittsburgh Steelers are second to Brady and the Patriots with 8 appearances. Just as you find yourself every NFL postseason wondering how the Patriots are in another Super Bowl, every year you find yourself wondering how a particular city is chosen to host the Super Bowl. The model has changed over time The deciding factor in determining a Super Bowl city used to be warm weather, which is why Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Pasadena and San Diego have hosted 34 of the 53 Super Bowls since the game\u2019s inception in 1967. Miami and New Orleans are tied for hosting the most Super Bowls at 10, and Miami will host Super Bowl LIV in 2020 for a record 11th time. ", "The Super Bowl is the annual championship game for the National Football League (NFL). It is the culmination of a four-game exhibition preseason, 16-game regular season, and a single-elimination postseason. For the initial four games, the Super Bowl featured the champion of the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL). The two leagues merged in 1970. Since the merger, the game pits the champions of the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC) against one another, at a previously determined site.

Additionally, a player from one of the participating teams of the Super Bowl is selected as the game\u2019s most valuable player.

How can I get 2025 Super Bowl Tickets? To get a Super Bowl ticket from a primary source is close to impossible for the average fan. The NFL distributes most of the tickets to the 32 NFL teams (the two Super Bowl teams get the biggest percentage). Those tickets will go to players, team staff, and a few lucky season ticket holders.

Banks conduct these transfers on their own behalf as well as for the benefit of other financial service providers and bank customers, both corporate and consumer. Related retail transfer systems facilitate transactions such as automated clearing houses (ACH); automated teller machines (ATM); point-of-sale (POS); telephone bill paying; home banking systems; and credit, debit, and prepaid cards. Most of these retail transactions are initiated by customers rather than by banks or corporate users. These individual transactions may then be batched in order to form larger wholesale transfers, which are the focus of this section. The two primary domestic wholesale payment systems for interbank funds transfers are the Fedwire Funds Service (Fedwire\u00ae) ", "In 2022, the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) Bank celebrated its 20 years of service. The solution has been playing a key role in supporting the FX market, growing from USD 1.2 trillion in 2001 to USD 6.5 trillion in 2022 in daily transactions amounts.* Let us take advantage of this milestone to reassess the benefits of CLS. What is CLS? CLS is an independent multi-currency settlement system for FX transactions. Able to manage 18 currencies, it handles an average of one million daily transactions worth over USD 6.5 trillion (source: CLS, H1 2022 figures). 'Over 70 of the world\u2019s most important financial institutions choose to be direct members of CLS, and over 30,000 more market participants benefit from the use of our services. As we celebrate our 20th anniversary, we reflect on why these clients place their trust in us every day and what we deliver to them in return \u2013 now and in the future,' said Marc Bayle de Jess\u00e9, CLS CEO, in the article celebrating the CLS 20 years of service. CLS was originally created to mitigate settlement risk, i.e. the risk of default of one of the counterparties[1], as a FX transaction is composed of two non-simultaneous cash flows. A good example is a USD/JPY transaction: Outside CLS, the seller settles his JPY on T-1, whilst the buyer settles the USD on T.With CLS, the two flows are simultaneously settled. This is the Payment versus Payment (PvP) principle. The primary advantage of CLS: reducing risk International banks have been the first to adopt the CLS system in order to reduce their FX settlement risk, also called 'Herstatt risk'. For a bit of history, in 1974, the bankruptcy of the German bank Herstatt blocked the dollar interbank payment system. Herstatt\u2019s American counterparties found themselves with unsecured claims due to the time difference of their unsettled transactions with their German counterparts. Nowadays, this type of issue is something that would not happen to CLS users. ", "Moving towards a broader adoption of CLS? Since 2020, market conditions have been putting CLS benefits to the test, even for participants with relatively limited FX volumes. Institutional investors can use CLS to different ends. An asset manager can use CLS to optimise and simplify the operational processes of its forex transactions. An insurer, a pension fund or a sovereign wealth fund may be driven by the goal of making their FX transactions and assets more secure. A corporation may settle its FX trades in CLS to streamline FX post-trade processes. Even international authorities \u2013 such as the central banks of the currencies covered by CLS or the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) \u2013 have long recognised the fundamental role of CLS in ensuring the stability and economic security of FX settlements between financial institutions. However, CLS does not cover all FX transactions. Some participants are constrained by the 18-currency scope. Others deal in more complex transactions than traditional derivatives or process same day transactions, which are not part of the CLS processing scope. Our forward looking view for CLS While Continuous Linked Settlement is a mature service seen as the industry gold standard for FX settlement, the service is still gaining traction with new participants joining the platform on a regular basis. As of writing, the community is mostly made of investment funds and banks (97%). Whereas, the corporate segment is still to tap into the benefits of CLS, currently representing less than 0.3% of participants (as of December 2021).

It provides a straightforward, consistent, powerful interface for programming systems. That's why the C language is widely used for developing system software, application software, and embedded systems. The C programming language has been highly influential, and many other languages have been derived from it. For example, C++ and Java are two popular modern dialects of C. And C is an excellent choice for system programming, for example, developing operating systems, compilers, and network drivers. Despite its popularity, C is not without its criticisms. Some have argued that its syntax could be more complex and easier to learn, while others have noted its lack of standardization as a significant issue. Nevertheless, C remains a widely used and influential language and will probably continue for many years. History of C language The C programming language was created at Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s, mainly by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. For the UNIX operating system, which at the time required applications to be written in assembly language, programmers needed a more user-friendly set of instructions. Assembly programmes, which communicate directly with a computer's hardware, are lengthy and complex to debug, and adding new functionality requires a lot of time and effort. Thompson's first high-level language was named  B after the BCPL system programming language on which it was built. Thompson rewrote B to better match the demands of the modern time, better system hardware after Bell Labs purchased a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) UNIX system model PDP-11. As a result C, the B's successor, was created. By 1973, C had matured to the point that it could be used to rewrite the UNIX operating system. Other programmers needed documentation that detailed how to use C before it could be utilized effectively outside of Bell Labs. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book 'The C Programming Language,' sometimes known as K&R or the 'White Book' by C enthusiasts, became the canonical source for C programming. The second edition of K&R, first published in 1988, is still commonly accessible as of this writing. Based on the book, the first, pre-standard version of C is known as K&R C. Throughout the 1980s, C developers sought to build standards for the language in order to prevent others from developing their own dialects. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard X3.159-1989 became the official U.S. standard for C in 1989. In 1990, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) issued the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard. These standards, as well as their later updates, are referenced in C versions after K&R. (C89, C90 and C99). The 1980s saw a surge in operating system development, with C and its use in UNIX being only such instances. Despite its advancements over its predecessors, C was still difficult to use for creating larger software programmes. As computers got more powerful, there was a growing demand for a more user-friendly programming environment. This desire pushed programmers to use C to create their own compilers and, as a result, new programming languages. These new languages may make it easier to code complex operations with many moving elements. For example, object-oriented programming, a programming method that maximizes a programmer's ability to reuse code, was eased by languages like C++ and Java, both of which were derived from C.

After watching an insane amount of video, Abby has zoned in on a fella named Abraham, who looks like the homeless guy that Sharif 'caught' stealing.  She reports that she saw him say, 'the day of judgment is coming.' ", "Gibbs encourages Ziva to disclose what happened afterwards, and she reveals that she had gone to Saleem's camp alone to protect the surviving team members, who were both injured. She briefly describes the circumstances of her capture and admits that she did not intend to live through the ordeal. Gibbs gets up, whispers in her ear, and kisses her forehead, causing her to break down in relief. As the episode ends, Vance approves Ziva's application which results in Ziva becoming an NCIS Special Agent albeit a Probie. Production 'Good Cop, Bad Cop' is written by David North and Jesse Stern and directed by Leslie Libman. Flashbacks that are interspersed throughout the episode are set in various locations, including Jordan, the Red Sea, and Somalia. ", "Initially rejected by most of the other characters, she is eventually accepted as a member of the NCIS team and as a surrogate daughter figure to team leader Gibbs (Mark Harmon). She also serves as a foil for Special Agent Tony DiNozzo, a former Baltimore homicide cop and 'wannabe playboy' played by Michael Weatherly. From early in Ziva's time on the show producers began to toy with the idea of pairing them romantically, but continued to place a number of obstacles in their way (namely difficult circumstances and other love interests). Ziva's upbringing is alluded in her first few seasons. She is depicted as having a somewhat troubled background with a difficult family history. Her younger sister was killed in a terrorist attack against Israel, and her half-brother Ari Haswari became a Hamas terrorist; she eventually kills him onscreen to prevent him from killing Gibbs. ", "Back in Washington D.C., Tony starts to question Ziva's loyalty when she defends Rivkin's actions. In a confrontation between the two over Ziva's reluctance to tell Gibbs about her connection to Rivkin, Ziva asks if Tony's suspicions of Rivkin are fuelled by jealousy. It is made evident that Ziva is in a romantic relationship with Rivkin in the closing moments of Part II as the two are seen in bed together. ", "The search and rescue of Ziva was written into the seventh season premiere, but rather than show her in captivity, the writers decided to script the episode from Tony's point of view. This allowed them to shock the audience by opening the episode with Tony strapped to the interrogation chair, rather than Ziva, as well as keep viewers wondering about Ziva's fate. Brennan relayed, 'You'll think you know what's going on, but then you'll go, 'Am I seeing things? What just happened?'' Within the episode, Tony, under the influence of truth serum, recounts to Saleem the events that occurred during the four months since Ziva's disappearance: the team at first attempted to replace Ziva without success. After becoming concerned about her continued lack of communication, they hacked into Mossad's database and learned that she had been put on the assignment to find and kill Saleem. Gibbs then informed them that the Damocles, the ship the Mossad team had taken, had sunk in a storm and that there were no survivors. Tony subsequently became despondent for some time until deciding that they needed to avenge Ziva's death by killing Saleem. This led to him and McGee intentionally being taken captive and interrogated upon locating the camp through the shipment of the fictional drink, 'Caf-Pow!'. In present day, he concludes that Ziva is 'not replaceable'. ", "'The early episodes were a bit tense - he wanted to embrace her and bring her back into the fold but felt the need to be standoffish. Will he be someone she can trust, implicitly? Absolutely, without doubt. Will he ever be the warm and fuzzy big fluffy teddy bear in the corner? No, not a chance. At the end of the day, Gibbs is a realist.' \u2014Mark Harmon on Gibbs and Ziva She becomes a suspect for the marine's death when Eli, in an attempt to prevent her from leaving Mossad, orders her former team leader, Malachi Ben Gidon, who had been on the mission with her, to accuse her of being responsible for the killing. After she is proven innocent, Gibbs angrily states that Ziva is 'off limits' to Eli. They reconcile, with Ziva relaying the rest of what happened up to being taken captive. Gibbs then whispers something in her ear and kisses her forehead as she breaks down crying. ", "Afterwards, the subject is alluded to during specific cases, such as when the team deals with a rape victim at the end of Season 7 and an abused wife in the middle of Season 8. In the latter case, Head Medical Examiner Ducky Mallard (David McCallum) suggests that Gibbs have Ziva be the one to confront the woman, saying, 'Agent David has been through things you and I can't even imagine, and she knows what it's like to be controlled.' Michael Nouri was brought back to guest star as Eli David during the eighth season, and the consequences of his actions are addressed. Ziva is able to forgive him somewhat, and he tries to reach a full reconciliation in Season 10's 'Shabbat Shalom'. However, he is killed in a targeted shooting before he is able to make peace with his daughter, greatly devastating Ziva and prompting her to embark on a campaign of revenge against the man responsible: Ilan Bodnar. Use of torture Ziva's ordeal in Somalia included being tortured by Saleem and his men, but the producers avoided depicting it graphically. Shane Brennan wrote a cliffhanger for the season finale that briefly shows her in the aftermath of an evidently brutal interrogation; in it, she is limp and tied to a chair, bloody and bruised. Makeup specialists were able to use a significant amount of cosmetics on de Pablo to make her face 'nearly unrecognizable'. The torturer, later identified as Saleem, casually returns to her cell, rips off her Star of David pendant, and demands that she tell him what she knows about NCIS. She does not appear again until her rescue in the Season 7 premiere, where she is hooded, 'ready to die', and unable to walk on her own. ", "The actor joined the cast of 'NCIS' during Season 3, portraying Ziva David, a daring Mossad agent who eventually goes to work for Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Harmon) full-time. Over the years, she became an integral part of the team and a sort of daughter figure to Gibbs himself. That relationship became a major point of narrative interest for fans, in no small part because Harmon and de Pablo displayed incredible onscreen chemistry during the almost 200 episodes they worked together on the show. And yes, it was well on display during a Season 7 scene in which Gibbs leans in to whisper something into Ziva's ear. ", "As for that Season 7 whisper, it came upon Ziva David's surprising return from a shocking Season 6 twist. And it drew further intrigue among many not only because the words are muted, but also because it's a touch more paternally intimate than we'd generally seen from Gibbs \u2014 even in regards to Ziva David. As it was, 'NCIS' fans were no doubt bummed Mark Harmon wouldn't reveal what was said. They were likely even more so when he revealed he was speaking to his co-star out of character.

{"ID": 511, "All Sources": ["Historically, the early Anglo-Protestant settlers in the seventeenth century were the most successful group, culturally, economically, and politically, and they maintained their dominance till the early twentieth century. Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families, such as Boston Brahmin, First Families of Virginia, Old Philadelphians, Tidewater, and Lowcountry gentry or old money, were WASPs. Commitment to the ideals of the Enlightenment meant that they sought to assimilate newcomers from outside of the British Isles, but few were interested in adopting a Pan-European identity for the nation, much less turning it into a global melting pot. However, in the early 1900s, liberal progressives and modernists began promoting more inclusive ideals for what the national identity of the United States should be. While the more traditionalist segments of society continued to maintain their Anglo-Protestant ethnocultural traditions, universalism and cosmopolitanism started gaining favor among the elites. These ideals became institutionalized after the Second World War, and ethnic minorities started moving towards institutional parity with the once dominant Anglo-Protestants. ", "The late 19th century saw the creation of a modern industrial economy. A national transportation and communication network was created, the corporation became the dominant form of business organization, and a managerial revolution transformed business operations. An era of intense partisanship, the Gilded Age was also an era of reform. The Civil Service Act sought to curb government corruption by requiring applicants for certain governmental jobs to take a competitive examination. The Interstate Commerce Act sought to end discrimination by railroads against small shippers and the Sherman Antitrust Act outlawed business monopolies. ", "Much has been written about the enmity and suspicion that existed between the Russian and the Spanish-Mexican authorities in California, but their disagreements have been overstated. The Spanish government officially forbade its subjects from trading with foreigners. Commercial exchanges, however, did take place between the Spanish and the Russians beginning with Rezanov\u2019s visit, and, in the early days of Ross, the Californios supplied the Russians with their first wheat, fruit trees, cattle, and horses. Because the Californios undertook almost no manufacturing of their own, they had considerable demand for farm implements and household wares. As the Russian colony grew, it was soon able to fulfill some of this demand. There was hardly a useful item of wood, metal, or leather that the promyshlenniki and artisans did not produce, and soon the Russians sold ploughs, axes, nails, wheels, metal cookware and longboats to their neighbors in exchange for grain, salt, and other raw materials. After Mexico won her independence from Spain in 1821, foreign trade was no longer against the law. Trade between the Californios and the Russians continued, but now there was more competition from the Americans and British. Competition lowered the price of Russian goods and increased the price of California produce. Trade relations were further hampered by the Mexican imposition of new anchorage fees on all foreign vessels entering California ports. One compensation for the Russians, however, was their control of Bodega Bay, their main shipping port. Here they had established storage and supply facilities as well as landing rights, all made available to foreign vessels. Here some supplies were warehoused and others taken to Fort Ross by baidara and baidarka or by horseback. The journey between the port facilities at Bodega Bay and Fort Ross usually took five hours, whether by land or by sea. With this port of entry and with their variety of goods for sale, the Russians were able to continue trading with the Californios, as evidenced, for example, by the records of the sale of gunpowder and uniforms, procured or produced by the Russians, to General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, on the nearby Mexican frontier. ", "On these and other expeditions, Voznesenskii was able to gather an ethnographically invaluable collection of California Indian artifacts. These include ornaments, weapons, garments and baskets that can be seen today at the Museum of Ethnography, St. Petersburg, Russia. Many of these objects are the sole surviving items of their kind. Voznesenskii\u2019s travel notes tell of his many local excursions, from the islands of San Francisco Bay to the forests of the Mendocino Coast. They contain observations of the lives of Californians, from the children at Fort Ross to the foreign merchants at Yerba Buena (San Francisco). The Last Years of the Russian Colony At the same time, the Mexican government\u2019s active encouragement of new settlers into the area, as well as a growing influx of Americans, posed a looming challenge to Russian claims over territory, which neither the Imperial government in distant St. Petersburg nor the Russian-American Company was able to meet. A last effort to avert a Russian withdrawal came in 1836 when Baron von Wrangell journeyed from Sitka to Mexico City to seek an improvement in relations with the new Mexican Republic. He also sought Mexico\u2019s formal recognition of the legality of Russia\u2019s claim to Fort Ross, previously denied by both Spain and Mexico. The Mexicans were willing to yield on this issue, but only in return for Russia\u2019s diplomatic recognition of their own national independence as a republic. However, Tsar Nicholas I, an unwavering defender of absolute monarchy and a foe of revolutionary change, rejected the condition, and so ended any chance of a favorable resolution of the contested issue of the 'legitimacy' of the Russian colony. In April 1839, the Tsar approved of the Company\u2019s plan to liquidate the settlement, and shortly thereafter the Company offered all of its California holdings for sale. ", "On January 1, 1842, Rotchev and about one hundred colonists sailed from Bodega Bay on the last Russian ship bound for Sitka. After 30 years, the flag of the Russian-American Company was lowered at Fort Ross, and the Russian epoch in the history of California came to a close. Russia\u2019s California Outpost in Historical Perspective The venture of the Russian-American Company into California was short-lived. However, the memory of it has lingered long, preserved in the buildings and the stockade at Fort Ross, both original and restored, in the place names of scattered creeks and coves along the northern coast and of the largest river in Sonoma County, and in the vestiges of Russian and Native Alaskan influence on the Kashaya Pomo language and culture. The Russians were the first to explore and map parts of Northern California, and they were also the first known Europeans to climb Mt. St. Helena. ", "Throughout California, Indigenous nations have used fire for thousands of years as a tool to steward the land, and still do today. When Europeans colonized California, they found a garden of redwoods and other lands. Evidence of this stewardship can still be seen on the trees at Muir Woods. Fire scars tell the story of Indigenous cultural burns set by the first stewards of Muir Woods, the Coast Miwok. Cultural burns passed down through generations have\u202fbenefited\u202fboth land and people, by improving\u202fsoil quality, and spurring growth of certain plant species, creating a healthy and resilient landscape. ", "You may not think of California when you think of the Civil War, but the war deeply divided Californians as it did the rest of the country. Secessionists dominated the Southern half of the state, while Northern California remained predominately pro-Union. Even before the war began, California played an important role in the fight over slavery, as events here helped to set the stage for war. The financial prowess of the state's rich gold mines and pro-Union business elite would ensure the success of the Northern war effort by keeping it well-funded. Without this steady supply of gold, the outcome of the war might have been very different. Addditionally, California led the nation in contributions to the United States Sanitary Commission, which was the primary organization responsible for the medical treatment of the many military casualties suffered on the Union side. Like other Northern states, California supplied thousands of soldiers for the Union war effort; California troops were responsible for pushing the Confederate Army out of Arizona and New Mexico in 1862. Additionally, numerous California regiments were organized and joined with state regiments back east. Californians would face the enemy in most of the major battles in the East, including one regiment, organized and commanded by the former California Senator Edward Dickinson Baker (then a Colonel), that defended against Pickett's charge at Gettysburg, arguably the most pivotal military action of the war. In all, over 17,000 Californians would join as soldiers; this is the highest per-capita total for any state in the Union.

One of the oldest known primate-like mammal species, Plesiadapis, came from North America; another, Archicebus, came from China. Other similar basal primates were widespread in Eurasia and Africa during the tropical conditions of the Paleocene and Eocene. Purgatorius is the genus of the four extinct species believed to be the earliest example of a primate or a proto-primate, a primatomorph precursor to the Plesiadapiformes, dating to as old as 66 million years ago. ", "The earliest strepsirrhines are known as adapiforms, a diverse group that ranged throughout Eurasia and North America. An early branch of this clade gave rise to lemuriform primates, which includes lemurs and their kin. David Begun has theorised that early primates flourished in Eurasia and that a lineage leading to the African apes and humans, including Dryopithecus, migrated south from Europe or Western Asia into Africa. However, the early European fauna is exemplified by Darwinius, a basal strepsirrhine dated to 47 million years (early Eocene) Evolution of haplorrhines This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (July 2020) The earliest haplorrhine primates from the fossil record are the omomyids, which resembled modern day tarsiers. Like the strepsirrhine adapiforms, omomyids were diverse and ranged throughout Eurasia and North America. The phylogeny of omomyids, tarsiers, and simians is currently unknown. ", "chapter 'Primate Origins and Supraordinal Relationships: Morphological Evidence,' Vol. 2).The origin of the primates as defined above is still undocumented, because terrestrial faunas from the right time and region are lacking. A dense and continuous fossil record of mammals is known in North America, but primates originated elsewhere. A more discontinuous fossil record of Paleocene mammals is known in South America, in Europe, and in Eastern Asia (Mongolia, China), but again without early primates. Despite recent progress, the Paleocene fossil record of mammals remains very poor in Africa, although one fauna yielded the single Paleocene primate known at the moment, Altiatlasius from Morocco, discussed below. This fossil shows that primates had reached Africa by the Late Paleocene; however, there is strong evidence that they did not originate in Africa but rather in Asia, where their two living sister groups, the tree shrews and flying lemurs, are found today (see chapter 'Primate Origins and Supraordinal Relationships: Morphological Evidence,' Vol. 2). A Paleocene fossil record of Southeast or Western Asia should give some definitive clues to this enigma; it would at the same time test a competing scenario, that of an origin on the northward-rafting Indian plate.The Paleocene-Eocene boundary, 55 Ma ago, witnessed a series of climatic and paleogeographic events that resulted in the first occurrence of primates in North America, Europe, and Asia (China). This occurrence is part of a much broader dispersal event concerning several orders of mammals as well as other animals and plants. This dispersal followed a dramatic episode of global warming, which is one of the most fascinating climatic events discovered in the last 20 years (e.g., Aubry et al. 1998). Starting in the Early Eocene , a tropical climate and environment at high latitudes allowed the radiation ", "Primates first appear in the fossil record about 55 million years ago, in a period called the Eocene (55 to 34 million years ago), also known as the Dawn of the Age of Mammals. Bloch said he has long been fascinated by the 10 million years preceding the Eocene. 'The Paleocene, about 65 (million) to 55 million years ago, is the time period between the extinction of the dinosaurs and the first appearance of a number of undisputed members of the modern orders of mammals,' Bloch said. 'The demise of the dinosaurs opened up ecological space for mammals to diversify, which they did\u2014and quickly.' Part of this mammalian diversification led to plesiadapiforms. 'So what we\u2019ve discovered are skeletons of these plesiadapiforms from the Paleocene,' Bloch said. 'For many years, people have tried to come up with a definition of primates. Morphologically speaking, what defines a primate? It\u2019s a lot harder to answer that question than you might think.' ", "The complex unfolding of human evolution over the past 7 million years is but one small story in the larger volume of primate evolutionary history. Humans, and our hominin ancestors, belong to a family of great apes that includes chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and their fossil precursors. Even these, however, are only the closest of our relatives within the Order Primates \u2013 a group that includes organisms as diverse as ring-tailed lemurs, tarsiers, and monkeys from both the Old World and New World. Primates first appeared in the fossil record nearly 55 million years ago, and may have originated as far back as the Cretaceous Period. Since that time, this evolutionary lineage has produced abundant and diverse species in nearly every continent on the planet (primate fossils have not been found in Australia or Antarctica). Primates scamper on the tops of branches, swing beneath them, and even leap acrobatically from tree to tree. Some are dedicated predators, eating small lizards and insects, whereas others are content to munch on leaves, grasses, or fruits. What, if anything, unites primates as a single group, and how do primate adaptations reflects our evolutionary past? What did the earliest primates look like and how are they related to modern forms? How has climate change influenced the diversification of different primate groups? How do primates navigate arboreal and terrestrial habitats? What processes are involved in fossilization and in dating fossils from the distant past? These are some of the questions that are addressed in the articles below. Presented at different levels of sophistication and supported with detailed glossaries, these contributions provide a broad but detailed account of the current state of knowledge about primate evolution and the methods used to gather this knowledge. It is only from this context that one can fully apprehend the strangest member of the primate clade: Homo sapiens. ", "The early vertebrates have a notochord, protected by a stiff rod of cartilage: they do not have a spine made of bone. The first vertebrate is probably quite like a lamprey, hagfish or lancelet. Around the same time, the first clear fossils of trilobites appear. These invertebrates, which look like oversized woodlice and grow to 70 centimetres in length, proliferate in the oceans for the next 200 million years. 520 million years ago Conodonts, another contender for the title of 'earliest vertebrate', appear. They look a little like eels \u2013 although whether they are truly vertebrates is still debated. 515 million years ago?

One of the oldest known primate-like mammal species, Plesiadapis, came from North America; another, Archicebus, came from China. Other similar basal primates were widespread in Eurasia and Africa during the tropical conditions of the Paleocene and Eocene. Purgatorius is the genus of the four extinct species believed to be the earliest example of a primate or a proto-primate, a primatomorph precursor to the Plesiadapiformes, dating to as old as 66 million years ago. ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_primates\nThe earliest strepsirrhines are known as adapiforms, a diverse group that ranged throughout Eurasia and North America. An early branch of this clade gave rise to lemuriform primates, which includes lemurs and their kin. David Begun has theorised that early primates flourished in Eurasia and that a lineage leading to the African apes and humans, including Dryopithecus, migrated south from Europe or Western Asia into Africa. However, the early European fauna is exemplified by Darwinius, a basal strepsirrhine dated to 47 million years (early Eocene) Evolution of haplorrhines This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (July 2020) The earliest haplorrhine primates from the fossil record are the omomyids, which resembled modern day tarsiers. Like the strepsirrhine adapiforms, omomyids were diverse and ranged throughout Eurasia and North America. The phylogeny of omomyids, tarsiers, and simians is currently unknown.

A dense and continuous fossil record of mammals is known in North America, but primates originated elsewhere. A more discontinuous fossil record of Paleocene mammals is known in South America, in Europe, and in Eastern Asia (Mongolia, China), but again without early primates. Despite recent progress, the Paleocene fossil record of mammals remains very poor in Africa, although one fauna yielded the single Paleocene primate known at the moment, Altiatlasius from Morocco, discussed below. This fossil shows that primates had reached Africa by the Late Paleocene; however, there is strong evidence that they did not originate in Africa but rather in Asia, where their two living sister groups, the tree shrews and flying lemurs, are found today (see chapter 'Primate Origins and Supraordinal Relationships: Morphological Evidence,' Vol. 2). A Paleocene fossil record of Southeast or Western Asia should give some definitive clues to this enigma; it would at the same time test a competing scenario, that of an origin on the northward-rafting Indian plate.The Paleocene-Eocene boundary, 55 Ma ago, witnessed a series of climatic and paleogeographic events that resulted in the first occurrence of primates in North America, Europe, and Asia (China). This occurrence is part of a much broader dispersal event concerning several orders of mammals as well as other animals and plants. This dispersal followed a dramatic episode of global warming, which is one of the most fascinating climatic events discovered in the last 20 years (e.g., Aubry et al. 1998).

Humans, and our hominin ancestors, belong to a family of great apes that includes chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and their fossil precursors. Even these, however, are only the closest of our relatives within the Order Primates \u2013 a group that includes organisms as diverse as ring-tailed lemurs, tarsiers, and monkeys from both the Old World and New World. Primates first appeared in the fossil record nearly 55 million years ago, and may have originated as far back as the Cretaceous Period. Since that time, this evolutionary lineage has produced abundant and diverse species in nearly every continent on the planet (primate fossils have not been found in Australia or Antarctica). Primates scamper on the tops of branches, swing beneath them, and even leap acrobatically from tree to tree. Some are dedicated predators, eating small lizards and insects, whereas others are content to munch on leaves, grasses, or fruits. What, if anything, unites primates as a single group, and how do primate adaptations reflects our evolutionary past? What did the earliest primates look like and how are they related to modern forms? How has climate change influenced the diversification of different primate groups? How do primates navigate arboreal and terrestrial habitats? What processes are involved in fossilization and in dating fossils from the distant past? These are some of the questions that are addressed in the articles below.

Independently of the development of optical lenses, some cultures developed 'sunglasses' for eye protection, without any corrective properties. For example, flat panes of smoky quartz were used in 12th-century China, and the Inuit have used snow goggles for eye protection.[a] Invention The Glasses Apostle by Conrad von Soest (1403) The earliest recorded comment on the use of lenses for optical purposes was made in 1268 by Roger Bacon. The first eyeglasses were estimated to have been made in Central Italy, most likely in Pisa or Florence, by about 1290: In a sermon delivered on 23 February 1306, the Dominican friar Giordano da Pisa (c.\u20091255\u20131311) wrote 'It is not yet twenty years since there was found the art of making eyeglasses, which make for good vision ... And it is so short a time that this new art, never before extant, was discovered. ... I saw the one who first discovered and practiced it, and I talked to him.' ", "Early frames for glasses consisted of two magnifying glasses riveted together by the handles so that they could grip the nose. These are referred to as 'rivet spectacles'. The earliest surviving examples were found under the floorboards at Kloster Wienhausen, a convent near Celle in Germany; they have been dated to circa 1400. The world's first specialist shop for spectacles - what we might regard today as an optician - opened in Strasbourg (then Holy Roman Empire, now France) in 1466. Other claims The 17th-century claim by Francesco Redi that Salvino degli Armati of Florence invented eyeglasses in the 13th century has been exposed as erroneous. Marco Polo is mistakenly claimed to have encountered eyeglasses during his travels in China in the 13th century. However, no such evidence appears in his accounts. Indeed, the earliest mentions of eyeglasses in China occur in the 15th century and those Chinese sources state that eyeglasses were imported. Over time, the construction of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (pince-nez). Girolamo Savonarola suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a hat. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed sometime before 1727, possibly by the British optician Edward Scarlett. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as 'scissors-glasses' and lorgnettes were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century. ", "For most of their history, eyeglasses were seen as unfashionable, and carried several potentially negative connotations: wearing glasses caused individuals to be stigmatized and stereotyped as pious clergymen, as those in religious vocation were the most likely to be literate and therefore the most likely to need reading glasses, elderly, or physically weak and passive. The stigma began to fall away in the U.S. in the early 1900s when the popular Theodore Roosevelt was regularly photographed wearing eyeglasses, and in the 1910s when popular comedian Harold Lloyd wore a pair of horn-rimmed glasses as the 'Glasses' character in his films. ", "When were eyeglasses really invented? Although many sources state that eyeglasses were invented in 1317, the idea for glasses may have started as early as 1000 B.C. Some sources also claim that Benjamin Franklin invented glasses, and while he did invent bifocals, this famous inventor cannot be credited with creating glasses in general. In a world where 60% of the population needs some form of corrective lenses to see clearly, it\u2019s hard to picture a time when eyeglasses weren\u2019t around.Who invented glasses? While archaeologists have found documents detailing 'optical-themed works' that date all the way back to 1000 B.C., evidence of spectacles doesn\u2019t occur in art or other historical records until the 13th century in northern Italy. For many years, the creation of glasses was credited to Salvino D\u2019Armate because his epitaph, in the Santa Maria Maggiore church in Florence, referred to him as the 'inventor of spectacles.' The 1317-dated epitaph has since been proven fraudulent \u2014 the term 'inventor' wasn\u2019t used in the 1300s.

The great Roman orator Cicero (106-43 BCE) lamented how cumbersome it was to have slaves read texts aloud. Or take the special kind of visual device created by the emperor Nero (37-68 CE): he watched his beloved gladiator fights using a transparent green stone in the hope that the light would refresh his eyes. This belief persisted into the 19th century. 'Sunglasses' from that period had green lenses and were also worn indoors. But when and where did the invention of a proper visual aid actually begin?

These are referred to as 'rivet spectacles'. The earliest surviving examples were found under the floorboards at Kloster Wienhausen, a convent near Celle in Germany; they have been dated to circa 1400. The world's first specialist shop for spectacles - what we might regard today as an optician - opened in Strasbourg (then Holy Roman Empire, now France) in 1466. Other claims The 17th-century claim by Francesco Redi that Salvino degli Armati of Florence invented eyeglasses in the 13th century has been exposed as erroneous. Marco Polo is mistakenly claimed to have encountered eyeglasses during his travels in China in the 13th century. However, no such evidence appears in his accounts. Indeed, the earliest mentions of eyeglasses in China occur in the 15th century and those Chinese sources state that eyeglasses were imported. Over time, the construction of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (pince-nez). Girolamo Savonarola suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a hat. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed sometime before 1727, possibly by the British optician Edward Scarlett. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as 'scissors-glasses' and lorgnettes were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century. ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses\nFor most of their history, eyeglasses were seen as unfashionable, and carried several potentially negative connotations: wearing glasses caused individuals to be stigmatized and stereotyped as pious clergymen, as those in religious vocation were the most likely to be literate and therefore the most likely to need reading glasses, elderly, or physically weak and passive. The stigma began to fall away in the U.S. in the early 1900s when the popular Theodore Roosevelt was regularly photographed wearing eyeglasses, and in the 1910s when popular comedian Harold Lloyd wore a pair of horn-rimmed glasses as the 'Glasses' character in his films. ", "https://www.allaboutvision.com/eyeglasses/faq/invention-of-specs/\nWhen were eyeglasses really invented? Although many sources state that eyeglasses were invented in 1317, the idea for glasses may have started as early as 1000 B.C. Some sources also claim that Benjamin Franklin invented glasses, and while he did invent bifocals, this famous inventor cannot be credited with creating glasses in general. In a world where 60% of the population needs some form of corrective lenses to see clearly, it\u2019s hard to picture a time when eyeglasses weren\u2019t around.Who invented glasses? While archaeologists have found documents detailing 'optical-themed works' that date all the way back to 1000 B.C., evidence of spectacles doesn\u2019t occur in art or other historical records until the 13th century in northern Italy. For many years, the creation of glasses was credited to Salvino D\u2019Armate because his epitaph, in the Santa Maria Maggiore church in Florence, referred to him as the 'inventor of spectacles.' The 1317-dated epitaph has since been proven fraudulent \u2014 the term 'inventor' wasn\u2019t used in the 1300s.

The reason: for the first time in human history, millions of people were able to enjoy good vision in spite of problems with their vision. Today we take this for granted, but for centuries there was simply no solution for those suffering from a visual impairment \u2013 glasses still had to be invented. It took a long time to develop the modern glasses we know today. This process required a lot of experimentation, and many different types of glasses came and went. BETTER VISION recounts the history of glasses \u2013 from their beginnings as 'reading stones' to their transformation into sought-after lifestyle and fashion accessories. The invention of glasses is considered a crucial step forward in humanity's cultural history: suddenly, people suffering from visual impairments could not only play an active role in day-to-day life, but also study for longer, expand their knowledge and then pass it on to others. The great Roman orator Cicero (106-43 BCE) lamented how cumbersome it was to have slaves read texts aloud. Or take the special kind of visual device created by the emperor Nero (37-68 CE): he watched his beloved gladiator fights using a transparent green stone in the hope that the light would refresh his eyes. This belief persisted into the 19th century. 'Sunglasses' from that period had green lenses and were also worn indoors. But when and where did the invention of a proper visual aid actually begin?

Abbott and Costello's gold record for 'Who's on First?' B-478.56 (Milo Stewart, Jr. / National Baseball Hall of Fame) Share this image: ", "'Who's on First?' is Abbott and Costello's signature routine. Time magazine (December 26, 1999) named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century. The sketch was based on other earlier burlesque wordplay routines. They began honing the routine shortly after teaming up in 1936, and performed it in vaudeville in 1937 and 1938. It was first heard by a national radio audience on March 24, 1938, when the team were regulars on the Kate Smith radio show. By then, John Grant had been writing or adapting other sketches for the team and may have helped expand 'Who's on First?' prior to its radio debut. He stayed on as their head writer into the 1950s. Depending upon the version, Abbott has either organized a new baseball team and the players have nicknames, or he points out the proliferation of nicknames in baseball (citing St. Louis Cardinals sibling pitchers Dizzy and Daffy Dean) before launching into the routine. The infielders' nicknames are Who (first base), What (second base) and I Don't Know (third base). The key to the routine is Costello's mounting frustration set against Abbott's unyielding formality. Audio recordings are readily available on the Internet. A notable version is the first television performance on the 1951 Colgate Comedy Hour. Abbott and Costello performing 'Who's on First?'

NBC's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2006), a drama about life backstage at a television comedy series, used 'Who's on First?' as a plot device. A TV movie called Bud and Lou, based on a book by Hollywood correspondent Bob Thomas, was broadcast in 1978.

In the 2016 sci-fi movie Arrival, the two Heptapods (alien beings) are named Abbott and Costello by the scientists, because the one named Abbott is taller and quieter while the one named Costello is shorter and chattier. The names also have extra-diegetic significance as two of the main themes in the movie are linguistics and (mis)communication, which mirrors themes of the 'Who's on First?' routine.

I watched it for the first time right after Carnival 2023 but opted to wait until it was still seasonal. Seasonal? Read on, gentle readers. The premise is outlandish. The boys, as they were always called even when they were in their mid-Forties. find themselves on a space ship that accidentally launches. Their first landing is just outside New Orleans during Carnival. The boys think they\u2019ve landed on Mars. I\u2019m skipping the crime subplot altogether. Suffice it to say that Bud and Lou meet their evil twins who rob a bank while clad in space suits. The costume designers at Universal Pictures had a great time with this movie. I understand they had some local help as well. Dig these images: Here\u2019s Lou Costello with a bowhead. Stilt-walkers are still around in modern Carnival but not as ubiquitous as in the 1950\u2019s: ", "This Abbott and Costello movie was a departure from their norm. Bud plays a dual role as the number two man in a large vacuum cleaner company with offices all over and also he plays a cousin exiled to Stockton with impossible quotas, both are pretty straight ones. Lou gets the funny man role as usual. He plays a farm boy who has taken a mail order course by records no less on being a salesman. He goes to the big city to try and get a job, screws it up and gets sent to the Stockton branch. Here he gets fooled in to believing he can read minds, goes out and breaks the all time one day sales record by selling nine cleaners. Meanwhile Bud in his main role has been keeping not only double books but skimming off the profits into a secret account. Then at a company meeting Lou finds out the mind reading thing was all a hoax, so he goes back home only to find the company president and some others waiting. They want to hire him as the regional sales manager for his local area and so all ends well. Oh yeah he also gets the girl. ", "Abbott and Costello star in 'Little Giant', and it's got some of their usual stuff, but they don't appear as a team in this movie. Lou is a sap hoping to make his way in the business world, only to repeatedly run into trouble in the process. Bud appears in dual roles, playing the managers of the company's branches. My favorite scene was Lou performing some twisted mathematics.While more serious than most of A&C's movies, it does let Lou engage in his usual clumsiness. The main point is that in this setting, there are plenty of folks eager to use his naivete against him.I understand that Bud and Lou were starting to have a falling-out when they made this. They made a few more movies together, but by the end, their relationship had soured so much that Bud learned of Lou's death by reading about it in the newspaper (at least that's what I've heard).Anyway, an interesting movie, if nothing great. 0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Permalink 3/10 ", "Abbott & Costello work apart in this experimental film that sees Lou as Benny Miller, a young man living in the country with his mother(played by Mary Gordon). He has just recently completed a correspondence course in becoming a salesman, and goes into the city to become a vacuum cleaner salesman, where he goes to work for it's crooked president played by Abbott, who uses him for his own purposes. He is a bust as a salesman however, though his colleagues play a cruel trick on him that eventually backfires... Elena Verdugo plays Lou's understanding fianc\u00e9e. Strange film works at keeping them apart, but is seldom funny, and pretty contrived, though innocuous enough to be acceptable viewing. 0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

The ancient animal transformers protect the stone and have traveled to Earth to hide themselves and the stone. When autobots that support the planet eater arrive on Earth to find the stone the transformers and animal transformers will need to work together to protect the stone.This movie is directed by Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II) and stars Anthony Ramos (In the Heights), Dominique Fishback (Judas and the Black Messiah), Dean Scott Vazquez (In the Heights), Tobe Nwigwe (Mo) and Michael Kelly (Dawn of the Dead).This storyline was really compelling and interesting. It was tremendous watching the animal and car transformer worlds combine. The CGI and special effects were outstanding and every action scene is a 10/10. I really adored every fight. However, we didn't need the humans in this at all, and the action, dialogue and plot points involving Ramos and Fishback were painful. They are good actors whose performances weren't good here and felt out of place. It's time to move on from the humans needing to be the heroes in these storylines...because the Transformers, both good guys and bad guys, were awesome.Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the Transformers series that I would strongly recommend.

Lips Of An Angel landed at #1 in Australia in February 2007 and retained that place for seven weeks. The second single from Hinder\u2019s debut album, Extreme Behaviour, made the American rockers a household name. But what if it went country? Winkler claimed that the new version 'still rocks, but it's got a little country twist to it now' in a recent interview with PEOPLE. Telling the story of how Winkler connected with Shaylen and how the collaboration happened, the singer explained, 'There was a guy named Brian Howes, who actually [co-wrote and produced] the first Lips Of An Angel. He was the one who connected us, and that's how I first heard Shaylen's voice. I was blown away.' Shaylen responded, 'When they told me that they would love for me to do it, I literally was dumbfounded. And then to go meet Austin at RCA Studios\u2026it just worked. He\u2019s a fucking rockstar of a human being.' Explaining how the country-fied version of Lips Of An Angel utilises a TikTok trend that shows the female perspective that was often missing in early 2000s rock music videos, Shaylen continued: 'You have the guy perspective in the original, but then you also realise women and humans, in general, go through this feeling every day. Join our community with our FREE weekly newsletter ", "'Lips of an Angel' is a song by American rock band Hinder, produced and co-written by Brian Howes and Joseph Lombardo. It was released in April 2006 as the second single from their 2005 debut album, Extreme Behavior. It was their breakthrough hit, charting within the top ten on several US Billboard genre charts, reaching number three on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, and peaking at number one in Australia and New Zealand. It has sold 3.6 million copies in the US as of January 2015, making it one of the most downloaded rock songs. Jack Ingram released a cover of the song in 2006, which reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Content ", "The song is featured in the music-related video games Lips (as downloadable content), Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore, Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party, and Band Hero. On June 12, 2020, the Canadian Blink-182 podcast 'Blink-155' released a compilation, consisting of 65 covers of 'Lips of an Angel', recorded by the members of the Blink-155 fan base (known as the 'Nation' or 'Naysh') as well as the hosts of the podcast, Sam Sutherland & Josiah Hughes. The compilation is titled 'It's Really Good to Hear Your Voice', in reference to one of the lyrics of the song. The compilation was mastered by Dan Birch and the artwork was done by Kyle Mabson. All proceeds from the compilation get donated to charities related to the Black Lives Matter movement. Hinder drummer Cody Hanson said of the compilation, 'Whether people are making fun of it or not, I think it's awesome either way.'

Having a combination adds variation to the music video so it doesn\u2019t get too repetitive. The main plot of the video is about a man (lead singer Austin Winkler) who is finding it hard to move on from his last girlfriend. Through the video we see flashbacks of his time with her and moments where he is with his new girlfriend. The flashbacks are presented in a different form to the rest of the video; they are played to us in black and white and as though we are watching an old tape recording; all the memories in these parts are positive. \u2018Lips of an Angel\u2019 is the bands second single which came out in 2005. The song made it to the charts in numerous countries including USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. ", "'So, there was a guy named Brian Howes, who actually [co-wrote and produced] the first \u2018Lips of an Angel,' Winkler tells PEOPLE. 'He was the one who connected us and that's how I first heard Shaylen's voice. I was blown away.' Shaylen and Austin John Winkler. Taylor Ballantyne 'Blown away\u2019 certainly describes the similar feeling of Shaylen, a pop turned country darling whose rock side shines on the new version of 'Lips of an Angel.' 'When they told me that they would love for me to do it, I literally was dumbfounded,' says the former pop artist who has already attracted much attention with country-tinged songs such as 'Roots' and 'What If I Don\u2019t.' 'And then to go meet Austin at RCA Studios\u2026it just worked. He\u2019s a f---ing rockstar of a human being.' The reimagined version of 'Lips on an Angel' also materialized thanks to the viral 'female perspective' TikTok trend, allowing for the chance to finally give the girl on the phone's viewpoint. 'I mean, I think that's the really cool part,' explains Shaylen. 'You have the guy perspective in the original, but then you also realize women and humans in general go through this feeling every day. No matter if you're male or female, you are always wondering if they're doing good. It\u2019s really cool to be given the opportunity to have that voice on the female part.' Austin John Winkler and Shaylen. Taylor Ballantyne Shaylen Opens Up About Her Move from Pop to Country: 'Something in My Heart Wasn't Happy Anymore' Certainly, 'Lips of an Angel' is a song Shaylen has plenty of history with. 'It was definitely a childhood staple for me,' reflects Shaylen in a recent interview with PEOPLE about the song included on Hinder\u2019s 2005 debut album, Extreme Behavior. 'I would play Nickelback and then I would play Hinder. I'd look out the car window and I would think I was in a music video.' She laughs. 'I was so dramatic!' Shaylen and Austin John Winkler. Aly Marotte And Winkler is quick to note that the reimagined version of 'Lips of an Angel' 'still rocks, but it's got a little country twist to it now,' so too does the music video have a little twist of its own. 'You think Austin and I the whole time are talking to each other,' says Shaylen about the storyline of the music video premiering exclusively on PEOPLE. 'But when they set up the treatment, it was so sick because you think we were talking to each other and then you realize we're both talking to other people. So, it's a nice little turn of events because when I saw that, I was like, \u2018Hell yeah, that's fire.\u2019' Shaylen and Austin John Winkler.

In spot-type detectors, all of these components are arranged inside a chamber where air, which may contain smoke from a nearby fire, flows. In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums, optical beam or projected-beam smoke detectors are used instead of a chamber within the unit: a wall-mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device or reflected to the receiver by a reflector. In some types, particularly optical beam types, the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the photosensor. The received light intensity will be reduced due to scattering from particulates of smoke, air-borne dust, or other substances; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold, potentially due to smoke. In other types, typically chamber types, the light is not directed at the sensor, which is not illuminated in the absence of particles. If the air in the chamber contains particles (smoke or dust), the light is scattered and some of it reaches the sensor, triggering the alarm. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), 'photoelectric smoke detection is generally more responsive to fires that begin with a long period of smoldering'. Studies by Texas A&M and the NFPA cited by the City of Palo Alto, California state, 'Photoelectric alarms react slower to rapidly growing fires than ionization alarms, but laboratory and field tests have shown that photoelectric smoke alarms provide adequate warning for all types of fires and have been shown to be far less likely to be deactivated by occupants.' Although photoelectric alarms are highly effective at detecting smoldering fires and do provide adequate protection from flaming fires, fire safety experts and the NFPA recommend installing what are called combination alarms, which are alarms that either detect both heat and smoke or use both the ionization and photoelectric smoke sensing methods. Some combination alarms may also include a carbon monoxide detection capability. The type and sensitivity of light source and photoelectric sensor and type of smoke chamber differ between manufacturers.

An americium container from a smoke detector ", "Photoelectric detectors and ionization detectors differ in their performance depending on the type of smoke generated by a fire. A presentation by Siemens and the Canadian Fire Alarm Association reports that the ionization detector is the best at detecting incipient-stage fires with invisibly small particles, fast-flaming fires with smaller 0.01\u20130.4 micron particles, and dark or black smoke, while more modern photoelectric detectors are best at detecting slow-smouldering fires with larger 0.4\u201310.0 micron particles, and light-coloured white/grey smoke. Photoelectric smoke detectors respond faster to fire that is in its early, smoldering stage. The smoke from the smoldering stage of a fire is typically made up of large combustion particles between 0.3 and 10.0 \u03bcm. Ionization smoke detectors respond faster (typically 30\u201360 seconds) to the flaming stage of a fire. The smoke from the flaming stage of a fire is typically made up of microscopic combustion particles between 0.01 and 0.3 \u03bcm. Also, ionization detectors are weaker in high airflow environments. Some European countries, including France, and some US states and municipalities have banned the use of domestic ionization smoke alarms because of concerns that they are not reliable enough as compared to other technologies. Where an ionizing smoke detector has been the only detector, fires in the early stages have not always been effectively detected. ", "The ionization smoke detector reacts to both visible and invisible products of combustion. This spot-type detector contains a small radiation source that produces electrically charged air molecules called ions. The presence of these ions allows a small electric current to flow in a chamber. When smoke particles enter the chamber, they attach themselves to the ions, reducing the flow of electric current. The change in the current sets off the alarm. ", "Ionization detectors are not suitable for use in applications where high ambient radioactivity levels are to be expected. High ambient radiation reduces the detector's sensitivity. Ionization detectors have been known to react to non-fire-generated particles of combustion and the presence of ozone, ammonia, or insects. Single chamber ionization detectors installed in higher altitudes usually require a modification in sensitivity during installation. Photoelectric Smoke Detectors There are two types of photoelectric detectors - beam and light scattering, both of which consist of a light source, a collimating lens system, and a photosensitive cell. Aerosols generated during the combustion process affect the propagation of light as they pass through the air. The combination of the aerosol and air mixture results in two conditions that can be used to detect the presence of a fire. These are: (1) the attenuation of the light intensity integrated over a beam path length, and (2) scattering of the light (i.e., Tyndall effect) at various angles to the beam path. Beam-type smoke detectors.The beam-type photoelectric detector is a photoelectric smoke detector that works on the obscuration principle. A light beam is directed at a photocell. When no smoke interferes with this beam, the receiver accepts the beam at a specified voltage level, but when smoke interferes with the beam, the infrared light reaching the receiver drops below the predetermined sensitivity level of the receiver, initiating a signal. Beam-type photoelectric detectors can be sensitive to voltage variations, dirt on the lens or mirrors, building vibration, and insects.

Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. Its name 'CN' referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government's real estate portfolio. The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower. It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers. It is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline and attracts more than two million international visitors annually. It houses several observation decks, a revolving restaurant at some 350 metres (1,150 ft), and an entertainment complex. History CN Tower from the Toronto Islands The original concept of the CN Tower was first conceived in 1968 when the Canadian National Railway wanted to build a large television and radio communication platform to serve the Toronto area, and to demonstrate the strength of Canadian industry and CN in particular. These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972. The tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see CityPlace), a large development south of Front Street on the Railway Lands, a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant after the opening of the MacMillan Yard north of the city in 1965 (then known as Toronto Yard). Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; John Andrews Architects; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division). ", "Two years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that 'All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,' and that 'Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.' Phases of construction Constructing the base, July 1973 Brackets being raised, August 1974 Helicopter lifting part of antenna, March 1975 Main pod construction, April 1975 Nearing completion, December 1975 Two months after opening, August 1976 Opening The CN Tower opened on June 26, 1976. The construction costs of approximately CA$63 million ($318 million in 2023 dollars) were repaid in fifteen years. ", "On June 26, 1986, the tenth anniversary of the tower's opening, high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate Dan Goodwin, in a sponsored publicity event, used his hands and feet to climb the outside of the tower, a feat he performed twice on the same day. Following both ascents, he used multiple rappels to descend to the ground. From 1985 to 1992, the CN Tower basement level hosted the world's first flight simulator ride, Tour of the Universe, based on the flight of a Space Shuttle. The ride was replaced in 1992 with a similar attraction entitled 'Space Race.' It was later dismantled and replaced by two other rides in 1998 and 1999. The 1990s and 2000s ", "The CN Tower consists of several substructures. The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the stairwells and power and plumbing connections. The tower's six elevators are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the tower; the tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the tower is a 102 m (334.6 ft) tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying television and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace, which are both located at an elevation of 342 m (1,122 ft), the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as 'Indoor Observation Level') located at 346 m (1,135 ft), and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as 'Space Deck') at 446.5 m (1,465 ft), just below the metal antenna. The hexagonal shape is visible between the two highest areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large tripod. ", "Panorama as viewed from the CN Tower: Toronto Islands and Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport on Lake Ontario on left; Toronto's Financial District on right Lighting Illuminated in the colours of the Flag of France following the November 2015 Paris attacks The CN Tower was originally lit at night with incandescent lights, which were removed in 1997 because they were inefficient and expensive to repair. In June 2007, the tower was outfitted with 1,330 super-bright LED lights inside the elevator shafts, shooting over the main pod and upward to the top of the tower's mast to light the tower from dusk until 2 a.m. The official opening ceremony took place on June 28, 2007, before the Canada Day holiday weekend. The tower changes its lighting scheme on holidays and to commemorate major events. After the 95th Grey Cup in Toronto, the tower was lit in green and white to represent the colours of the Grey Cup champion Saskatchewan Roughriders. From sundown on August 27, 2011, to sunrise the following day, the tower was lit in orange, the official colour of the New Democratic Party (NDP), to commemorate the death of federal NDP leader and leader of the official opposition Jack Layton. When former South African president Nelson Mandela died, the tower was lit in the colours of the South African flag. When former federal finance minister under Stephen Harper's Conservatives Jim Flaherty died, the tower was lit in green to reflect his Irish Canadian heritage. On the night of the attacks on Paris on November 13, 2015, the tower displayed the colours of the French flag. On June 8, 2021, the tower displayed the colours of the Toronto Maple Leafs' archrivals Montreal Canadiens after they advanced to the semifinals of 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs. The CN Tower was lit in the colours of the Ukrainian flag during the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. ", "Taller than the CN Tower are numerous radio masts and towers, which are held in place by guy-wires, the tallest being the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, in the United States at 628 m (2,060 ft) tall, leading to a distinction between these and 'free-standing' structures. Additionally, the Petronius Platform stands 610 m (2,001 ft) above its base on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico near the Mississippi River Delta, but only the top 75 m (246 ft) of this oil and natural gas platform are above water, and the structure is thus partially supported by its buoyancy. Like the CN Tower, none of these taller structures are commonly considered buildings. On September 12, 2007, Burj Khalifa, which is a hotel, residential and commercial building in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (formerly known as Burj Dubai before opening), passed the CN Tower's 553.33-m height. The CN Tower held the record of the tallest freestanding structure on land for over 30 years. ", "Although it\u2019s a completely different country, Toronto is only about a 4.5-hour drive from where I\u2019m living in metro Detroit, so it was an easy trip. My parents came along too! I hadn\u2019t been to Toronto since college, and I\u2019d forgotten how big and tall Toronto is. Endless skyscrapers! The tallest structure, though, is the CN Tower. It\u2019s 1,815 feet tall, and was the tallest free-standing structure in the world from 1976, when it was completed, until 2007. Now it\u2019s the tallest free-standing structure in the western hemisphere, and the ninth-tallest in the world. The observation levels are not at the very top. The tower extends far above them. The first of the four public levels is 1,122 feet above the sidewalk, roughly 2/3rds of the way up. That\u2019s where the race ends. Well, kind of. (I\u2019ll get into this later.)

You have no chance, but to lose.' However, Jim Kerr and his boys impressively proved I was wrong. But let\u2019s get back to Live in the City of Light. ", "Live in the City of Light is the first (double LP / CD) live album by Scottish rock band Simple Minds. It was released in May 1987 to document their successful worldwide Once Upon a Time tour, and charted at No. 1 in the UK. The album spawned one chart single release, a live version of 'Promised You a Miracle'. Overview The album was recorded live mainly on 12 & 13 August 1986 at Le Z\u00e9nith, Paris, France (Paris is nicknamed 'La Ville de Lumi\u00e8re' which means 'The City of Light', hence the album title), on the last dates of the Once Upon a Time world tour, with the only track 'Someone, Somewhere In Summertime' recorded in late October 1986 at Sydney Entertainment Centre in Sydney, Australia. It features the band's 1986 touring lineup, which included second vocalist Robin Clark and percussionist Sue Hadjopoulos. Additional 'fixing and mixing' was done at Castle Sound Studios in Edinburgh and Bearsville Studios in Bearsville, New York. Lisa Germano (at the time, a John Mellencamp band member who would perform on Simple Minds' next studio single, Belfast Child), contributed studio-overdubbed violin on 'Someone Somewhere in Summertime' and former Simple Minds member Derek Forbes contributed uncredited bass guitar overdubs. Album cover Although the album was not recorded there, the inside of the gatefold sleeve curiously features a photograph taken at another show from the same Once Upon A Time tour: on 9 July 1986 at Piazza Grande, a square in Locarno, Switzerland. Release details Live in the City of Light was released as a double vinyl album with the band's logo in gold lettering over black sleeve. The package featured a 12' x 12' attached giant-sized booklet with state-of-the-art photography of the band's performance and outdoor session pictures. This art could not be reproduced faithfully on later CD releases (an original 1st pressing on double-fat jewel case and the USA version packaged in a long box on two separate discs). Track listing All tracks recorded live on 12 & 13 August 1986 at Le Z\u00e9nith, Paris, France except 'Someone, Somewhere In Summertime' recorded live on 24 (or 30) October 1986 at the Entertainment Centre, Sydney, Australia.

In addition to its powerful iconography (the hands are \u001b[96m[4] friendship, the crown loyalty and the heart is love\u001b[0m), the ring symbolised the wearers\u013a status: Those who are unattached and free should wear the ring on their right hand with the heart pointing out. If spoken for, wear the ring on the right hand with the heart pointing in. Moreover, if married (so your heart is taken), then wear the ring on the left hand with the heart pointing in. Did Jim knew the history or the meaning of the ring before deciding that it would be the crux of Live in the City of Light\u013as artwork? Malcolm Garrett confirmed that Jim suggested the design, and the artist offered an alternative view, suggesting the fingers formed a heart.

Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a 'splendid first strike' capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union. The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965. ", "In early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro. According to one report, Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp. The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a 'nuclear umbrella' for attacks upon the island. By May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans 'with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles'.:\u200a29\u200a The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on 4 July and Khrushchev on 7 July.

He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees. The Soviet troops would arrive in Cuba heavily underprepared.

Construction of several missile sites began in the late summer, but U.S. intelligence discovered evidence of a general Soviet arms build-up on Cuba, including Soviet IL\u201328 bombers, during routine surveillance flights, and on September 4, 1962, President Kennedy issued a public warning against the introduction of offensive weapons into Cuba. Despite the warning, on October 14 a U.S. U\u20132 aircraft took several pictures clearly showing sites for medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) under construction in Cuba. These images were processed and presented ", "In the early stages of the Cuban missile crisis, this photograph showed that the Soviet Union was amassing offensive ballistic missiles in Cuba. President John F. Kennedy warned that any attempt by the Soviet Union to place nuclear weapons in Cuba would be seen as a threat to the United States. Throughout 1962, in the midst of the Cold War, the movement of Soviet personnel and equipment to Cuba had aroused suspicions in the American intelligence community. In response, U.S. ships and planes began photographing every Cuba-bound Soviet vessel, and U-2 spy planes began regular reconnaissance flights over the island, just 90 miles off the coast of Florida.

In response, U.S. ships and planes began photographing every Cuba-bound Soviet vessel, and U-2 spy planes began regular reconnaissance flights over the island. The first evidence of the arrival in Cuba of surface-to-air missiles, missile-equipped torpedo boats for coastal defense, and large numbers of Soviet military personnel came in photographs taken in late August. But these pictures provided no evidence of offensive ballistic missiles. In September, Kennedy delivered two explicit warnings to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev regarding the buildup of what were being called 'defensive' Soviet arms in Cuba.

President Kennedy did not want the Soviet Union and Cuba to know that he had discovered the missiles. He met in secret with his advisors for several days to discuss the problem. After many long and difficult meetings, Kennedy decided to place a naval blockade, or a ring of ships, around Cuba. The aim of this 'quarantine,' as he called it, was to prevent the Soviets from bringing in more military supplies. He demanded the removal of the missiles already there and the destruction of the sites. On October 22, President Kennedy spoke to the nation about the crisis in a televised address.
