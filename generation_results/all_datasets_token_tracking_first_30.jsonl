{"ID": 60, "All Sources": ["If you're a parent, you've probably dealt with your fair share of spit-up. Every baby does it at least every now and then. Some do it pretty often, even with every feeding. Most babies who spit up are \"happy spitters\" -- they're content, comfortable, growing well, and have no breathing problems caused by vomiting. If that sounds like your little one, he doesn't need medicine. If not, tell your doctor what you've noticed so she can see what the problem is. After your baby swallows milk, it glides past the back of his throat and goes down a muscular tube, called the esophagus, to his stomach. A ring of muscles connects the esophagus and stomach. It opens to let the milk go into the stomach, and then it closes back up. If that ring, called the lower esophageal sphincter, doesn't tighten again, the milk can come back up. That's reflux. Infants are especially likely to get reflux because their stomachs are small -- about the size of their fists or a golf ball -- so they fill up easily. Also, a valve where their esophagus meets their stomach may not be mature enough yet to work like it should. That usually happens around age 4-5 months. After that, he may stop spitting up. Unlike happy spitters, babies with GERD may have: Discomfort and pain caused by the reflux Breathing problems, like gagging, choking, coughing, wheezing, and, worst-case scenario, pneumonia from inhaling their stomach contents into their lungs Sometimes poor growth, because vomiting keeps them from getting enough nutrients If your baby has any of these symptoms, talk to your pediatrician, who can see if your baby has GERD. 1. Keep your baby upright for 30 minutes after a feeding to let gravity help keep things down. 2. Make sure there is no pressure on his stomach after he eats. For example, wait at least 30 minutes before you put your baby in his car seat. 3. Burp him after every feeding. Sometimes these simple steps help enough to keep your little one a happy spitter.

Everyone has them. But \u001b[92m if they get into the urethra, they can end up in the bladder and cause an infection\u001b[0m. Bladder infections are more common in women than men for several reasons. A woman's urethra is shorter than a man's, and it's close to the vagina and anus, where bacteria live. Having sex, wiping from back to front after you go to the bathroom, putting in a tampon, and using a diaphragm for birth control are all ways bacteria can get in. During pregnancy, the baby can press on your bladder, which prevents it from emptying completely and gives bacteria a place to thrive. After menopause, women have less of the hormone estrogen. That causes the lining of the urethra to get thinner and may change the balance of bacteria in the vagina, making infections more likely. When men get them, a prostate infection usually is the cause. But any blockage -- like from a bladder stone or enlarged prostate -- can prevent the bladder from totally emptying and cause infection."], "Quoted Output": "When you get a bladder infection, \"You make countless trips to the bathroom, and still you feel like you have to go again.

{"ID": 80, "All Sources": ["Asthma attacks (worsening of asthma symptoms) can be triggered by allergies, which can temporarily increase the inflammation of the airways in a susceptible person. An allergy is the immune system's reaction when exposed to what is otherwise a harmless substance, such as plant pollen, mold, or animal hair, skin or saliva. The immune system acts as a body defense, yet for people with allergies, the immune system treats these substances, called \"allergens,\" as if they are harmful, causing a disruption to normal body functions. Allergens are what trigger a series of reactions by the immune system during an allergic reaction. Inhaled Allergens. The most important allergens for people with allergic asthma appear to be those asthma triggers that are inhaled. Hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs when a person comes in contact with an allergen or a substance that he or she is sensitive to. Common inhaled allergens include: Animal dander (skin, saliva) Dust mites Cockroach particles Mold Pollen Medical experts recommend that all people with allergies and asthma try to identify possible inhaled allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms. Food Allergies. Food allergies rarely cause asthma yet they can cause a severe life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. The condition can lead to symptoms that include difficulty breathing, wheezing, an itchy rash, low blood pressure, and vomiting. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, walnuts) Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Food preservatives can also trigger allergic and asthmatic reactions. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and may be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods If you suspect that certain foods may be the cause of your asthma, discuss this with your doctor. Allergy skin testing can be done to determine if you are allergic to these foods. If you have allergies and asthma, avoid the substance you are allergic to. Here are some tips to help you avoid some of the most common allergens and prevent asthma attack symptoms. Dust Mites Encase pillows, mattresses, and box springs with allergen-proof, zippered covers. Wash all bedding in hot water once a week. Non-carpeted flooring is best. If you cannot get rid of your carpeting, vacuum often with an HEPA filter. Wear a mask while vacuuming. If your child has asthma, do not vacuum while he or she is in the room. Products that eliminate dust mites from carpeting (such as Acarosan) can be purchased. Your asthma care provider can give you information about these products. Avoid curtains and drapes. Use plain window shades instead of mini-blinds. Washable curtains should be washed in hot water every two to four weeks. Dust all surfaces with a damp cloth often, including lampshades and windowsills. Keep clutter under control. Toys and books should be stored in enclosed bookshelves, drawers or closets. Replace traditional stuffed animals with washable stuffed animals. Keep all clothing in drawers and closets. Keep drawers and closets closed. Cover air ducts with filters. Change these when soiled. Pillows and bedding should not contain feathers. Keep indoor humidity low (below 50%). Use a dehumidifier if needed. Regularly change filters on heaters and air conditioners. Mold and Mildew Air out damp, humid areas frequently. Run a dehumidifier to keep humidity between 35% and 45%. Use air conditioners when possible. Clean bathrooms regularly using products that kill and prevent mold. Use exhaust fans to vent steam. Do not carpet the bathroom. Keep indoor plants out of bedrooms. When painting, add mold inhibitor to paint to prevent mold from growing. Avoid sources of outdoor molds, such as wet leaves or garden debris. To clean visible mold use a cleaning solution containing bleach ( one ounce per quart of water). Insects Many homes and apartments have cockroaches and other insects. Some people with asthma are allergic to a protein in their droppings. To control these allergens in your home: Use roach baits or traps. Insect sprays can be used, but should only be sprayed when no one is at home. Before you or your child returns home after spraying, make sure that your home has been aired out for a couple of hours. Because cockroaches thrive in high humid environment, fix water leaks in and around your home. Cover food in lidded or sealed containers. Clean dishes after eating. Sweep floors after you have eaten. Pollen Pollen is a tiny egg shaped cell from flowering plants. Pollens are difficult to avoid because they cannot be eliminated from the atmosphere. Plants have different periods of pollination, which varies little from year to year. Yet, the type of weather affects the amount of pollen in the air with hot, dry, and windy weather causing more pollen in the air. In general pollen season starts from February to October. You can lessen your or your child's exposure to pollen by: Limiting your or your child's outdoor activities during times of high pollen, such as early morning. Having him wear a hat outdoors, washing his hands and face when he comes inside, and having him change his clothes after being outside. Staying indoors during dry or windy days when pollen counts are high. Keeping windows closed during pollen seasons. Using air conditioning if possible. Pet Dander It is best not to own any pets if you or your child is highly allergic to pet dander. Long visits to friends and family who own pets should be avoided. If you do visit, make sure you or your child takes asthma or allergy medicines before the visit. Exposure to the pets should be kept to a minimum when visiting. If you must have a cat or dog in the home, restrict its living area. It should not be allowed in your or your child's bedroom at any time. If possible, keep the pet outside. Wash your pet weekly. Remove as much carpeting as possible. Animal dander deposits in the carpet and stays there, even after the pet is gone from the home. Food Allergies If you have allergies, avoiding food triggers can be challenging. It is important to always read food labels and, when dining out, ask how foods are prepared. Consider Allergy Shots You can train your immune system to not overreact to allergy triggers. Doctors do this by giving you allergy shots (immunotherapy) for asthma. An allergy shot is a small amount of the substance that causes your allergy. By giving repeated shots of the substance over a period of time, your immune system eventually stops causing the allergic reaction. Ask your doctor if you are a candidate for allergy shots for preventing asthma."], "All URLs": ["https://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/allergies-asthma"], "All Sources (cited)": ["https://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/allergies-asthma\nAsthma attacks (worsening of asthma symptoms) can be triggered by allergies, which can temporarily increase the inflammation of the airways in a susceptible person.

The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, walnuts) Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Food preservatives can also trigger allergic and asthmatic reactions. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and may be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods If you suspect that certain foods may be the cause of your asthma, discuss this with your doctor. Allergy skin testing can be done to determine if you are allergic to these foods. \u001b[92m If you have allergies and asthma, avoid the substance you are allergic to\u001b[0m. Here are some tips to help you avoid some of the most common allergens and prevent asthma attack symptoms. Dust Mites Encase pillows, mattresses, and box springs with allergen-proof, zippered covers. Wash all bedding in hot water once a week. Non-carpeted flooring is best. If you cannot get rid of your carpeting, vacuum often with an HEPA filter. Wear a mask while vacuuming. If your child has asthma, do not vacuum while he or she is in the room. Products that eliminate dust mites from carpeting (such as Acarosan) can be purchased. Your asthma care provider can give you information about these products. Avoid curtains and drapes. Use plain window shades instead of mini-blinds. Washable curtains should be washed in hot water every two to four weeks. Dust all surfaces with a damp cloth often, including lampshades and windowsills. Keep clutter under control. Toys and books should be stored in enclosed bookshelves, drawers or closets. Replace traditional stuffed animals with washable stuffed animals. Keep all clothing in drawers and closets. Keep drawers and closets closed. Cover air ducts with filters. Change these when soiled. Pillows and bedding should not contain feathers. Keep indoor humidity low (below 50%). Use a dehumidifier if needed. Regularly change filters on heaters and air conditioners. Mold and Mildew Air out damp, humid areas frequently. Run a dehumidifier to keep humidity between 35% and 45%. Use air conditioners when possible. Clean bathrooms regularly using products that kill and prevent mold. Use exhaust fans to vent steam. Do not carpet the bathroom. Keep indoor plants out of bedrooms. When painting, add mold inhibitor to paint to prevent mold from growing. Avoid sources of outdoor molds, such as wet leaves or garden debris. To clean visible mold use a cleaning solution containing bleach ( one ounce per quart of water). Insects Many homes and apartments have cockroaches and other insects. Some people with asthma are allergic to a protein in their droppings. To control these allergens in your home: Use roach baits or traps. Insect sprays can be used, but should only be sprayed when no one is at home. Before you or your child returns home after spraying, make sure that your home has been aired out for a couple of hours. Because cockroaches thrive in high humid environment, fix water leaks in and around your home. Cover food in lidded or sealed containers. Clean dishes after eating. Sweep floors after you have eaten. Pollen Pollen is a tiny egg shaped cell from flowering plants. Pollens are difficult to avoid because they cannot be eliminated from the atmosphere. Plants have different periods of pollination, which varies little from year to year. Yet, the type of weather affects the amount of pollen in the air with hot, dry, and windy weather causing more pollen in the air. In general pollen season starts from February to October. You can lessen your or your child's exposure to pollen by: Limiting your or your child's outdoor activities during times of high pollen, such as early morning. Having him wear a hat outdoors, washing his hands and face when he comes inside, and having him change his clothes after being outside. Staying indoors during dry or windy days when pollen counts are high. Keeping windows closed during pollen seasons. Using air conditioning if possible. Pet Dander It is best not to own any pets if you or your child is highly allergic to pet dander. Long visits to friends and family who own pets should be avoided. If you do visit, make sure you or your child takes asthma or allergy medicines before the visit. Exposure to the pets should be kept to a minimum when visiting. If you must have a cat or dog in the home, restrict its living area. It should not be allowed in your or your child's bedroom at any time. If possible, keep the pet outside. Wash your pet weekly. Remove as much carpeting as possible. Animal dander deposits in the carpet and stays there, even after the pet is gone from the home.

An allergy is the immune system's reaction when exposed to what is otherwise a harmless substance, such as plant pollen, mold, or animal hair, skin or saliva. The immune system acts as a body defense, yet for people with allergies, the immune system treats these substances, called \"allergens,\" as if they are harmful, causing a disruption to normal body functions. Allergens are what trigger a series of reactions by the immune system during an allergic reaction. Inhaled Allergens. The most important allergens for people with allergic asthma appear to be those asthma triggers that are inhaled. Hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs when a person comes in contact with an allergen or a substance that he or she is sensitive to. Common inhaled allergens include: Animal dander (skin, saliva) Dust mites Cockroach particles Mold Pollen Medical experts recommend that all people with allergies and asthma try to identify possible inhaled allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms.

{"ID": 81, "All Sources": ["Has anyone ever asked you if you have ADHD? Maybe you've even wondered yourself. The only way to know for sure is to see a doctor. That's because the disorder has a number of possible symptoms, and they can easily be confused with those of other conditions, like depression or anxiety. Not sure whether you should get checked by a doc? If many of these apply, you may need to get checked out. 1. People say you're forgetful. Everyone misplaces car keys or jackets once in a while. But this kind of thing happens often when you have ADHD. You might spend time looking for glasses, wallets, phones, and other items every day. You may also forget to return phone calls, space out on paying bills, or miss medical appointments. 2. People complain that you don't listen. Most of us lose focus on a conversation once in a while, especially if there's a TV nearby or something else grabs our attention. This happens often and to a greater degree with ADHD, even when there are no distractions around. But still, ADHD is more than that. 3. You're often late. Time management is an ongoing challenge when you have ADHD. It often leads to missed deadlines or appointments unless you work on avoiding that. 4. You have trouble concentrating. Problems with attention, especially focusing for long periods of time or paying attention to details, is one of the hallmarks of the condition. Depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders can also take a toll on your focus, and many people with ADHD have one or more of these issues, too. Your doctor can ask you questions to get to the bottom of what's causing your attention problems. 5. You leave things undone. Problems with attention and memory can make it tough to start or finish projects, especially ones that you know will take a lot of focus to complete. This symptom can point to depression, too. 6. You had behavior issues as a child. You need to have had attention and concentration problems as a child in order to be diagnosed with ADHD as an adult -- even if those early symptoms didn't come with a formal diagnosis. People may have accused you of being lazy back in childhood. Or they may have thought you had another condition like depression or anxiety. If you actually were diagnosed with the disorder as a child, you may still have it. The symptoms change as you age, and not everyone outgrows it. 7. You lack impulse control. This is more than tossing a candy bar into your cart at the checkout line. This is doing something even though you know it could have serious consequences, like running a red light because you think you can get away with it or not being able to keep quiet when you have something to say, even though you know you should. 8. You can't get organized. You may notice this more at work. You could have trouble setting priorities, following through on tasks, and meeting project deadlines. 9. You're fidgety. Kids with ADHD are often hyperactive, but adults are more likely to be fidgety or restless. You might also talk too much and interrupt others. 10. You can't control your emotions. You might be moody or irritable, express frustration often, feel unmotivated, or be prone to angry outbursts. ADHD can make it hard to manage uncomfortable emotions or follow appropriate behavior when you're upset. There's no one test. Instead, doctors and psychologists get information about what and how many symptoms you have, when they started, how long they've lasted, and how severe they are. In order to be diagnosed with ADHD, you need to have several symptoms, not just one or two. And they have to have affected your jobs, relationships, or other important areas of your life. Your doctor will also want to rule out other conditions or find out if you have more than one disorder. Several treatments can help you manage the condition. So if you answered yes to a lot of these questions, consider making an appointment with your doctor. The sooner you find out, the sooner you can start treatment."], "All URLs": ["https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adhd-ways-to-tell"], "All Sources (cited)": ["https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adhd-ways-to-tell\nHas anyone ever asked you if you have ADHD?

Most of us lose focus on a conversation once in a while, especially if there's a TV nearby or something else grabs our attention.

You need to have had attention and concentration problems as a child in order to be diagnosed with ADHD as an adult -- even if those early symptoms didn't come with a formal diagnosis. People may have accused you of being lazy back in childhood. Or they may have thought you had another condition like depression or anxiety. If you actually were diagnosed with the disorder as a child, you may still have it. The symptoms change as you age, and not everyone outgrows it. 7. \u001b[92m[7] You lack impulse control\u001b[0m. This is more than tossing a candy bar into your cart at the checkout line.

{"ID": 71, "All Sources": ["A pinched nerve happens when too much pressure is placed against a nerve by bones, tendons, muscles, or cartilage. It can start in several places throughout your body, usually in the joints. When a pinched nerve is in your elbow, it's called \u00e2\u0080\u009culnar nerve entrapment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It can leave your arm and hand feeling sore, numb, or weak. The ulnar nerve runs the entire length of your arm. It helps control the muscles in the forearm and hand. Sensations affecting your ring finger and little finger also travel though the ulnar nerve. Its most vulnerable point is at the elbow. If you've ever hit your elbow, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cfunny bone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d hard and felt a tingling down to your fingers, you've compressed your ulnar nerve. Leaning on your elbow for a long time can also irritate the nerve. Whenever you bend your elbow, you're forcing the nerve to stretch around the bones in the joint. If you sleep with your elbows bent, for instance, or you keep your elbows bent for a long time, you're putting more pressure on your ulnar nerve. A buildup of fluid in the elbow, caused by a condition such as bursitis, for instance, can also entrap the nerve. One of the first signs that you may have a pinched nerve in the elbow is weakness in your hand. You may not be able to grip things as tightly as you used to or lift heavy things the way you once did. Your hand may be more tender, more easily hurt, too. The ring finger and little finger may not be as strong and flexible as they used to be. Other symptoms of ulnar nerve entrapment include: tingling or numbness in the hand, especially the ring and little fingers cold sensitivity in the affected arm or hand tenderness at the elbow These symptoms tend to come and go at first. You may notice them more when your elbow is bent. You may even wake up in the middle of the night with a tingling feeling in your fingers. Reasons for compression of the ulnar nerve in the elbow aren't always known. You may not recall injuring your elbow or bending your elbow too much. Your chances of getting ulnar nerve entrapment are higher, though, if your elbow: has arthritis has been fractured was dislocated has been repeatedly injured If a pinched nerve in the elbow goes untreated for a long time, there could be permanent damage. Muscles controlled by the nerve may begin to get smaller and shorter. This is called muscle wasting, and it can't always be reversed. To avoid this problem, see a doctor quickly if you start to have severe pain, weakness, or tingling in your arm or hand. Even if your discomfort doesn't feel serious, call your doctor if it's been with you for at least 6 weeks. To get a proper diagnosis, you should see an orthopedist. Try to find someone who specializes in elbows and wrists. If you have arthritis and you see a rheumatologist, you may want to start with that doctor. She may later recommend you to an orthopedist. What you might expect: Medical review: Diagnosing the problem usually starts with a review of your medical history and your lifestyle. If you do a lot of heavy lifting or play contact sports, these would be helpful details to pass along. Physical exam: Your doctor will likely do a physical exam of your arm, tapping the spot where the nerve crosses the bone in your elbow. The doctor may also want to see whether the nerve itself slides out of its proper position when your elbow bends. You may be asked to put your arms in different positions and turn your neck from side to side to see whether that causes any pain or numbness. Your doctor may check the strength in your fingers and hand, and test for feeling in those areas. X-ray: You might have an X-ray taken so your doctor can look for bone spurs or arthritis. These may be placing pressure on your nerve. Nerve conduction study: In this test, the doctor stimulates your ulnar nerve in various places. An area that takes longer to respond may be where the nerve is compressed. This test is also helpful in diagnosing muscle wasting caused by nerve problems. Once you've been diagnosed with ulnar nerve entrapment, it will be time to decide how to treat the problem. The severity of the condition will help you and your doctor decide whether surgery or a less-invasive strategy is best. Nonsurgical treatments include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: NSAIDs can reduce pain and inflammation. A splint or brace: These can keep your elbow straight, especially while you're sleeping. An elbow pad: This helps reduce pressure on the joint. Occupational and physical therapy: This will improve the strength and flexibility of your arm and hand. Nerve-gliding exercise: Do this to help guide the nerve through the proper \u00e2\u0080\u009ctunnels\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the wrist and elbow. If nonsurgical options haven't eased your symptoms or there is obvious muscle damage, surgery may be necessary. The goal of surgery is to remove pressure from the nerve. In some cases, the nerve is moved as part of the operation. Some surgical treatment options include: Ulnar nerve anterior transposition: This moves the ulnar nerve so that it doesn't stretch over the bony parts of the elbow joint. Medial epicondylectomy: This removes the bump on the inside of the elbow joint, which takes pressure off the ulnar nerve. Cubital tunnel release: This removes part of the compressed tube through which the nerve passes in the elbow. If you have surgery, physical therapy to regain your arm and hand strength will likely be advised. You might need a splint for a few weeks to help make sure the elbow heals properly. Ongoing care for your elbow should include steps to avoid injuring or irritating the nerve further. You should be careful to avoid trauma to your elbow. You may also need to learn, with occupational therapy, how to hold your arm differently, stretch, or take frequent breaks when doing everyday activities such as working on your computer."], "All URLs": ["https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/pinched-nerve-in-elbow"], "All Sources (cited)": ["https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/pinched-nerve-in-elbow\nA pinched nerve happens when too much pressure is placed against a nerve by bones, tendons, muscles, or cartilage.

If you sleep with your elbows bent, for instance, or you keep your elbows bent for a long time, you're putting more pressure on your ulnar nerve. A buildup of fluid in the elbow, caused by a condition such as bursitis, for instance, can also entrap the nerve. One of the first signs that you may have a pinched nerve in the elbow is weakness in your hand. You may not be able to grip things as tightly as you used to or lift heavy things the way you once did. Your hand may be more tender, more easily hurt, too. The ring finger and little finger may not be as strong and flexible as they used to be. Other symptoms of ulnar nerve entrapment include: tingling or numbness in the hand, especially the ring and little fingers cold sensitivity in the affected arm or hand tenderness at the elbow These symptoms tend to come and go at first. You may notice them more when your elbow is bent. You may even wake up in the middle of the night with a tingling feeling in your fingers. Reasons for compression of the ulnar nerve in the elbow aren't always known. You may not recall injuring your elbow or bending your elbow too much. Your chances of getting ulnar nerve entrapment are higher, though, if your elbow: has arthritis has been fractured was dislocated has been repeatedly injured If a pinched nerve in the elbow goes untreated for a long time, there could be permanent damage. Muscles controlled by the nerve may begin to get smaller and shorter. This is called muscle wasting, and it can't always be reversed. To avoid this problem, see a doctor quickly if you start to have severe pain, weakness, or tingling in your arm or hand. Even if your discomfort doesn't feel serious, call your doctor if it's been with you for at least 6 weeks. To get a proper diagnosis, you should see an orthopedist. Try to find someone who specializes in elbows and wrists. If you have arthritis and you see a rheumatologist, you may want to start with that doctor. She may later recommend you to an orthopedist. What you might expect: Medical review: Diagnosing the problem usually starts with a review of your medical history and your lifestyle. If you do a lot of heavy lifting or play contact sports, these would be helpful details to pass along. Physical exam: Your doctor will likely do a physical exam of your arm, tapping the spot where the nerve crosses the bone in your elbow. The doctor may also want to see whether the nerve itself slides out of its proper position when your elbow bends. You may be asked to put your arms in different positions and turn your neck from side to side to see whether that causes any pain or numbness. Your doctor may check the strength in your fingers and hand, and test for feeling in those areas. X-ray: You might have an X-ray taken so your doctor can look for bone spurs or arthritis. These may be placing pressure on your nerve. Nerve conduction study: In this test, the doctor stimulates your ulnar nerve in various places. An area that takes longer to respond may be where the nerve is compressed. This test is also helpful in diagnosing muscle wasting caused by nerve problems. Once you've been diagnosed with ulnar nerve entrapment, it will be time to decide how to treat the problem. The severity of the condition will help you and your doctor decide whether surgery or a less-invasive strategy is best. \u001b[92m Nonsurgical treatments include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: NSAIDs can reduce pain and inflammation\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m A splint or brace: These can keep your elbow straight, especially while you're sleeping\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m An elbow pad: This helps reduce pressure on the joint\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m Occupational and physical therapy: This will improve the strength and flexibility of your arm and hand\u001b[0m. Nerve-gliding exercise: Do this to help guide the nerve through the proper \u00e2\u0080\u009ctunnels\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the wrist and elbow. If nonsurgical options haven't eased your symptoms or there is \u001b[92m obvious muscle damage, surgery may be necessary\u001b[0m. The goal of surgery is to remove pressure from the nerve. In some cases, the nerve is moved as part of the operation. Some surgical treatment options include: Ulnar nerve anterior transposition: This moves the ulnar nerve so that it doesn't stretch over the bony parts of the elbow joint. Medial epicondylectomy: This removes the bump on the inside of the elbow joint, which takes pressure off the ulnar nerve. Cubital tunnel release: This removes part of the compressed tube through which the nerve passes in the elbow. If you have surgery, physical therapy to regain your arm and hand strength will likely be advised. You might need a splint for a few weeks to help make sure the elbow heals properly. Ongoing care for your elbow should include steps to avoid injuring or irritating the nerve further. You should be careful to avoid trauma to your elbow. You may also need to learn, with occupational therapy, how to hold your arm differently, stretch, or take frequent breaks when doing everyday activities such as working on your computer."], "Quoted Output": "To help manage a pinched nerve in your elbow, \"nonsurgical treatments include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: NSAIDs can reduce pain and inflammation.\" Additionally, using \"A splint or brace: These can keep your elbow straight, especially while you're sleeping\" and \"An elbow pad: This helps reduce pressure on the joint\" can be beneficial.

{"ID": 63, "All Sources": ["Small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL) is a cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called a \"lymphocyte,\" which helps your body fight infection. You may hear your doctor refer to SLL as a \"non- Hodgkin's lymphoma,\" which is a group of cancers that affect lymphocytes. When you have SLL, too many ineffective lymphocytes live and multiply in your lymph nodes. These are pea-sized organs in your neck, groin, armpits, and elsewhere, that are part of your immune system. SLL tends to grow slowly. You may not have any symptoms when you're first diagnosed. A lot of people find out they have SLL when it's detected after a blood test for another reason. If you're not having symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. Instead, your doctor will watch your health regularly and won't suggest therapy until you need it. For some people, treatment knocks out the cancer for good, or keeps it from coming back for a long time. It's normal to have worries and questions about any serious condition. Learn about your treatment options, and seek out family and friends for support. They can help you get through the emotional and physical challenges ahead. You can't \"catch\" SLL like you do a cold or infection. It's also not passed on from parents to children. Doctors don't know exactly what causes it. They do know, though, that the disease is rare in people under 50. The average age that people get diagnosed with the disease is 65. And it affects men more than women. A few things are linked to a higher risk of getting SLL: You have a condition that causes you to have a weak immune system, like HIV/ AIDS. You've had chemotherapy. You live or work in a farming community. That's possibly because of exposure to pesticides and herbicides. You might not have any obvious symptoms when you're diagnosed with SLL. The disease might be found during a routine blood test. About one-third of all people with SLL live for years without having symptoms. When symptoms appear, they may include: Painless swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin Loss of appetite Fatigue Night sweats Fever Weight loss Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Have you ever noticed any swelling in your neck, armpit, or groin? Are you often tired? Is your appetite down lately? Have you lost any weight recently? Your doctor may also ask you to get a lymph node biopsy. This is the main test to diagnose SLL. Your doctor removes the lymph node and checks it under a microscope for signs of cancer. Many lymph nodes are near the surface of your skin. If that's the case, your doctor will give you a shot that numbs your skin. Then he'll make a cut and remove the lymph node. You can usually go home the same day. You'll have a small wound with a few stitches that can be removed in about a week. Your doctor may also do two bone marrow tests -- a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy -- to find out how advanced your cancer is. They are usually done together as part of a single procedure that removes marrow from the back of your hip bone. For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor first numbs the skin over your hip and the surface of the bone. He then inserts a thin needle into the bone and uses a syringe to suck out a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Usually the doctor does the bone marrow biopsy next. He removes a small piece of bone and marrow with a slightly larger needle. What stage is my cancer? Do I need treatment right now? What are my treatment options? Are there side effects to the treatments? How will my daily life be affected? What kind of follow-up care and monitoring will I need? If you have no symptoms, your doctor might recommend \"watchful waiting.\" During this period, he'll monitor you and start treatment if the disease starts to get worse. If you need treatment, you have several options: Chemotherapy. You can get various chemotherapy drugs that kill your cancer cells. The medicine comes in pill form or may be given through an IV. You may be treated with one drug or a combination. Chemotherapy is a key treatment for SLL and can often put the disease in remission, which means you no longer have any signs of cancer, although it can return. Monoclonal antibody therapy. These are drugs that act like man-made antibodies that specifically target cancer cells. They help your immune system destroy them. Rituximab ( Rituxan, Rituxan Hycela) and alemtuzumab ( Campath) are two common types. You get both through an IV. Radiation therapy. This uses high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in one or two groups of lymph nodes in the same part of the body. It may be useful if you're in the earlier stages of SLL and the disease hasn't spread. Targeted therapy. These drugs attack one or more specific targets on cancer cells. Your doctor might suggest them if you've already had another treatment that didn't work. Two examples are ibrutinib ( Imbruvica) and idelalisib ( Zydelig). Both are pills. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat SLL in clinical trials. These test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Besides new drugs, another treatment that may be part of a clinical trial is a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they're referring to \"embryo\" stem cells that are used in cloning. The stem cells in a transplant are different. They live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. This procedure may use your own stem cells or stem cells from a donor. If a donor supplies them, you'll need to find one who is the right match for you, so your body doesn't reject the new stem cells, or start fighting them the way it would fight an infection. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who's the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you'll most likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. Sometimes radiation therapy is also used. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. Certain medications can make these side effects less severe. When the high-dose chemo is done, you'll start the transplant. You get the new stem cells through an IV. You won't feel any pain from this, and you're awake while it's happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. Try your best to avoid infections. Eat a healthy diet, get proper rest, and stay away from sick people. Ask your doctor about which vaccinations you should receive, such as shots to prevent flu and pneumonia. Living with a serious illness poses many challenges, both physically and emotionally. For strength and support, surround yourself with those who care about you. They can offer comfort, as well as practical support. You may also find it helpful to talk to a professional counselor, spiritual leader, or a support group. SLL tends to be a slow-growing cancer. In time, though, SLL can turn into a more aggressive type of lymphoma. After initial treatment for SLL, many people have a period of remission, when there are no signs of active disease. The illness may not return. But for some people, SLL does come back. If the lymphoma returns, doctors can treat you again. Treatment for disease that returns can be successful, and you may have another period of remission. This keeps your lymphoma under control for many years.

You may hear your doctor refer to SLL as a \"non- Hodgkin's lymphoma,\" which is a group of cancers that affect lymphocytes. When you have SLL, too many ineffective lymphocytes live and multiply in your lymph nodes. These are pea-sized organs in your neck, groin, armpits, and elsewhere, that are part of your immune system. SLL tends to grow slowly. You may not have any symptoms when you're first diagnosed. A lot of people find out they have SLL when it's detected after a blood test for another reason. If you're not having symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. Instead, your doctor will watch your health regularly and won't suggest therapy until you need it. For some people, treatment knocks out the cancer for good, or keeps it from coming back for a long time. It's normal to have worries and questions about any serious condition. Learn about your treatment options, and seek out family and friends for support. They can help you get through the emotional and physical challenges ahead. You can't \"catch\" SLL like you do a cold or infection. It's also not passed on from parents to children. Doctors don't know exactly what causes it. They do know, though, that the disease is rare in people under 50. The average age that people get diagnosed with the disease is 65. And it affects men more than women. A few things are linked to a higher risk of getting SLL: You have a condition that causes you to have a weak immune system, like HIV/ AIDS. You've had chemotherapy. You live or work in a farming community. That's possibly because of exposure to pesticides and herbicides. You might not have any obvious symptoms when you're diagnosed with SLL. The disease might be found during a routine blood test. About one-third of all people with SLL live for years without having symptoms. When symptoms appear, they may include: Painless swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin Loss of appetite Fatigue Night sweats Fever Weight loss Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Have you ever noticed any swelling in your neck, armpit, or groin? Are you often tired? Is your appetite down lately? Have you lost any weight recently? Your doctor may also ask you to get a lymph node biopsy. This is the main test to diagnose SLL. Your doctor removes the lymph node and checks it under a microscope for signs of cancer. Many lymph nodes are near the surface of your skin. If that's the case, your doctor will give you a shot that numbs your skin. Then he'll make a cut and remove the lymph node. You can usually go home the same day. You'll have a small wound with a few stitches that can be removed in about a week. Your doctor may also do two bone marrow tests -- a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy -- to find out how advanced your cancer is. They are usually done together as part of a single procedure that removes marrow from the back of your hip bone. For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor first numbs the skin over your hip and the surface of the bone. He then inserts a thin needle into the bone and uses a syringe to suck out a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Usually the doctor does the bone marrow biopsy next. He removes a small piece of bone and marrow with a slightly larger needle. What stage is my cancer? Do I need treatment right now? What are my treatment options? Are there side effects to the treatments? How will my daily life be affected? What kind of follow-up care and monitoring will I need? If you have no symptoms, your doctor might recommend \"watchful waiting.\" During this period, he'll monitor you and start treatment if the disease starts to get worse. If you need treatment, you have several options: Chemotherapy. You can get various chemotherapy drugs that kill your cancer cells. The medicine comes in pill form or may be given through an IV. You may be treated with one drug or a combination. Chemotherapy is a key treatment for SLL and can often put the disease in remission, which means you no longer have any signs of cancer, although it can return. Monoclonal antibody therapy. These are drugs that act like man-made antibodies that specifically target cancer cells. They help your immune system destroy them. Rituximab ( Rituxan, Rituxan Hycela) and alemtuzumab ( Campath) are two common types. You get both through an IV. Radiation therapy. This uses high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in one or two groups of lymph nodes in the same part of the body. It may be useful if you're in the earlier stages of SLL and the disease hasn't spread. Targeted therapy. These drugs attack one or more specific targets on cancer cells. Your doctor might suggest them if you've already had another treatment that didn't work. Two examples are ibrutinib ( Imbruvica) and idelalisib ( Zydelig). Both are pills. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat SLL in clinical trials. These test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Besides new drugs, another treatment that may be part of a clinical trial is a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they're referring to \"embryo\" stem cells that are used in cloning. The stem cells in a transplant are different. They live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. This procedure may use your own stem cells or stem cells from a donor. If a donor supplies them, you'll need to find one who is the right match for you, so your body doesn't reject the new stem cells, or start fighting them the way it would fight an infection. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who's the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you'll most likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. Sometimes radiation therapy is also used. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. Certain medications can make these side effects less severe. When the high-dose chemo is done, you'll start the transplant. You get the new stem cells through an IV. You won't feel any pain from this, and you're awake while it's happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. \u001b[92m[1] Try your best to avoid infections\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[2] Eat a healthy diet, get proper rest, and stay away from sick people\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[3] Ask your doctor about which vaccinations you should receive, such as shots to prevent flu and pneumonia\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[4] Living with a serious illness poses many challenges, both physically and emotionally\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[5] For strength and support, surround yourself with those who care about you\u001b[0m.

{"ID": 64, "All Sources": ["When your child coughs, her body is doing its job. A cough is a reflex that clears fluid from the throat and chest. It happens when nerve endings in those airways get irritated. It's one of the most common symptoms of colds and other viruses, including the flu. But if it's caused by a virus, antibiotics won't make it stop. Viral infections have to run their course. Ask yourself some questions: Does your child have other symptoms? A cough that comes with a runny nose and sneezing may point to a cold. Those symptoms, body aches, and a fever often come with the flu. When did the cough start? Allergies are more likely in the spring and fall. What does it sound like? Allergies, viral infections, and the croup can bring on a barking cough. Whooping cough (pertussis) brings on a noise that sounds like \"hoop!\" Call your doctor if you hear that sound. A wheezing sound could mean something is blocking your child's airway. It could be brought on by pneumonia or asthma. Call the doctor. What if the cough won't go away? Visit the doctor. Most last no more than a few weeks, but some people have ones that stick around long after other symptoms are gone. In a child, a cough is considered chronic if it lasts more than 4 weeks. For adults, it's 8 weeks or more. Ask your doctor before giving your child any cough medicine. Don't give over-the-counter cough medicine to children younger than 4. They aren't meant for young kids. Even medicine labeled for children can have serious side effects, such as high blood pressure and seizures. No drugs can cure a cough caused by a virus, but treatments may soothe symptoms. Here are a few home remedies to try: Steam: You can create your own steam room. Close the door to your bathroom and run hot water in the shower for several minutes until the mirrors fog. The steam helps unclog your child's nose. Humidity: A cool-mist humidifier in your child's room adds moisture to the air to break up congestion and help your little one breathe easier. Fluids: Give her plenty of drinks like water or juice to thin the mucus in her throat, making it easier for her to cough up phlegm. Cough drops: For kids over age 5, lozenges and hard candy can bring some relief to a sore throat caused by coughing. Cool air: If your child has croup, take her outside for a while. The cool air sometimes can relieve a croupy cough. ( Just make sure you dress her properly for the weather.) If this doesn't help or you think your child is sick, get medical help. Saline drops: Saline or saltwater drops in the nose can help loosen congestion. Eventually, the symptoms should go away on their own.

{"ID": 82, "All Sources": ["Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS) is different for every person, so it can be hard to predict exactly what it will be like. But along with your treatment plan, there are some good ways to manage the condition. It helps to know how the disease can affect your life, so you can make changes that will help. There's no cure for HS, so you'll have to manage the condition for life. For most people, it's a cycle of flare-ups and periods when their skin is clear. Breakouts tend to happen in the same general areas of your skin. But you may have a spot that stays broken-out all the time. Some women find their HS clears up after menopause. HS is called a progressive disease. That means it often gets worse over time. A small pimple can turn into a large boil within days or hours. If the boil ruptures underneath the skin, inflammation and infection spread quickly and new lumps form nearby. A flare-up may last a week or two. But treatment can keep HS from getting worse and help you avoid the most serious symptoms. The key is to start it early. Your symptoms and the way your body responds to treatment will determine how often you see your doctor. You may be able to manage mild symptoms on your own. If you take a drug that's injected or delivered through a vein, you may need to go in regularly. People with HS tend to have other conditions, too, such as severe acne, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Doctors don't know exactly why these conditions are linked. But it may be that whatever causes HS leads to other problems, too. It's rare, but people who have HS for a long time may be more likely to get a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. It's important to see your doctor regularly, keep her updated on how you feel, and talk about any new or unusual symptoms you've noticed. It depends on how severe your condition is. Large, deep nodules or lumps can hurt. And depending on where they are, you may not be able to sit or walk normally. Some people only get these painful lumps from time to time when the disease flares. But for others, the bumps or lumps never completely go away. Whether you have pain only during flares or more often, your doctor can help you control it. You may get numbing creams or over-the-counter or prescription pain medicine. The lumps themselves don't smell, but the fluid inside them does. When they burst and leak, the odor can escape, too. Wear loose clothing and try to keep things from rubbing against the cysts. Don't squeeze them. If they do burst, wash the area gently with an antiseptic cleanser to get rid of the smell. Antibiotics may also help. HS can be unpredictable. You may have a flare-up every few weeks, or you may go months with clear skin. Some women find they have breakouts before their periods. They may go away while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. There's no sure way to prevent breakouts. But they may not come back as often or be as bad if you follow your treatment plan, take any medication your doctor prescribes, and make some changes to your lifestyle. Get to a healthy weight. HS is closely tied to obesity. Losing weight is one of the best ways to keep it under control. Quit smoking. Stay cool. Your HS may get worse in the summer, when heat and sweat can trigger a flare-up. Swimming is a good way to get exercise without overheating. Don't shave near a breakout. If your razor irritates your skin, laser hair removal may be a better choice. Watch what you eat. There's some evidence that it may help to cut dairy and sugar from your diet.

But treatment can keep HS from getting worse and help you avoid the most serious symptoms. The key is to start it early. Your symptoms and the way your body responds to treatment will determine how often you see your doctor. You may be able to manage mild symptoms on your own. If you take a drug that's injected or delivered through a vein, you may need to go in regularly. People with HS tend to have other conditions, too, such as severe acne, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Doctors don't know exactly why these conditions are linked. But it may be that whatever causes HS leads to other problems, too. It's rare, but people who have HS for a long time may be more likely to get a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.

Whether you have pain only during flares or more often, your doctor can help you control it. You may get numbing creams or over-the-counter or prescription pain medicine. The lumps themselves don't smell, but the fluid inside them does. When they burst and leak, the odor can escape, too. Wear loose clothing and try to keep things from rubbing against the cysts.

{"ID": 72, "All Sources": ["If you get a panic attack, it usually lasts 20 to 30 minutes, hitting its peak at about 10 minutes in. So what's going on if it seems to you like your panic attack just won't end? To figure out the possible reasons it feels this way, it helps to understand what's happening during a panic attack. When you have one, it triggers your \"fight or flight\" response, which is how your body reacts when your physical safety is threatened. You get a rush of adrenaline that amps you up so you can make a split-second decision to run or fight. This response isn't meant to last very long and soon burns itself out. That's why panic attacks that last as long as an hour aren't very common. What's the story with a panic attack that seems to go and on? If that's happening to you, it's likely one of three things: Waves of panic attacks Aftereffects of a single panic attack Another health condition If you have panic attack symptoms for an hour or more, you may really be having a wave of panic attacks, one after another. There's actually a period of recovery between them, though you may not notice it. The overall effect feels like you're being hit with one never-ending attack. It's rare that this happens, though. The fight or flight response is so draining, it's hard to set it off that often. A more likely possibility is that you had a single panic attack that leaves you feeling generally anxious, tired, and frayed. While panic attacks can be scary, they're not dangerous. But the fear they may cause you can be more unsettling than the attack itself. That's especially true if you've never had one before. When it's your first episode, you may think you're having a stroke or a heart attack. How do you tell if it's a panic attack or high anxiety? It's tricky. It helps to talk to your doctor, but a closer look at your symptoms often can give you some clues. A true panic attack tends to have clear, intense, physical symptoms -- a pounding heart, shortness of breath, and so on. Anxiety can give you some of these, but they tend to be milder. Instead, you'll have more mental symptoms like a racing mind, lots of worries you can't stop, and a hard time focusing. You might also feel restless and have a hard time sleeping. The condition that most closely mirrors a longer panic attack is generalized anxiety disorder. This is where you have a hard time controlling your worry, and you struggle to keep your anxiety in check. But one of the challenges with panic attacks, long or short, is that the same symptoms happen with a wide range of other health conditions, including allergic reactions and heart and lung diseases. And if you have a tendency to panic, some health problems -- like low blood sugar, asthma, or an overactive thyroid -- can trigger a full-blown panic attack. Keep in mind that typically, people mistake a panic attack for another health condition, not the other way around. Just because you're having a long panic attack, it doesn't mean you have something else going on. But it's worth checking it out with your doctor."], "All URLs": ["https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/continuous-panic-attacks"], "All Sources (cited)": ["https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/continuous-panic-attacks\nIf you get a panic attack, it \u001b[92m[1] usually lasts 20 to 30 minutes, hitting its peak at about 10 minutes in\u001b[0m.

Most lotions can't create a strong barrier for your skin because they contain water. Choose a thick cream or ointment instead. Petroleum jelly and mineral oil work well. Put it on your skin at least twice a day to keep your eczema at bay. Avoid drastic temperature changes. Going from a hot room into a chilly one may cause a flare-up. Try to keep your home at a comfortable, consistent temperature. Low humidity can dry your skin. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air. Skip long, hot showers. Very hot water will dry your skin and make your symptoms worse. Take lukewarm showers or baths instead. Use mild, perfume-free soap or non-soap cleanser, and avoid bubble baths. When you're done, gently towel off your skin -- don't rub -- until it's partly dry. Then, within 3 minutes, put on a moisturizer. If your doctor has prescribed an eczema cream, apply that to your skin first. Keep your house clean. Allergens like dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and mold put your immune system on alert, which can wake up your eczema. Skip scented laundry products. The perfume in many cleansers and fabric softeners can irritate your skin. You're better off using gentle, scent-free products. And always wash new clothes before wearing them. It'll help get rid of any excess dyes and chemicals that could inflame your skin. Wear loose clothing. It'll allow air next to your skin. Cotton or cotton-blend fabrics are good choices. That's especially helpful when you're working out because you're likely to sweat. Always avoid wool. It can rub against your skin and make you itch more. Try an over-the-counter oral antihistamine. Diphenhydramine ( Benadryl) works well to calm itching and help you sleep. Cetirizine ( Zyrtec) and loratadine ( Claritin) are non-drowsy options that may help you feel better during the day. Keep your cool. When your itching feels out of control, put a cold compress right on your skin. If your eczema is severe, after you've put on lotion or medicine, make a wet wrap by soaking a gauze or piece of soft clothing, like a T-shirt or pair of socks, in warm -- not hot -- water. Wet wraps help your skin absorb medicine and moisture. They also relieve itching and pain. Once they're dry, you'll want to either make them wet again or remove them. Ask your doctor if you should take vitamin D. Experts say there's a link between eczema and low levels of the \u00e2\u0080\u009csunshine\u00e2\u0080\u009d vitamin. Check to see what supplement you can try for a boost. Stay calm. Angst and stress can make you itch and scratch even more. Look for ways to ease your mind. Talk with friends, try a yoga class, or learn how to meditate.

{"ID": 65, "All Sources": ["By age 65, more than half of us will have X-ray evidence of osteoarthritis, a disease in which the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones at the joints breaks down and bony overgrowth occurs. For many, the result is stiffness and pain in the joint. Although osteoarthritis (or OA) is more common as we age, it is not an inevitable part of aging. As researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis, they are able to offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and lessen its impact on your life. Here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. If you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. If you are overweight, losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. Obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES), a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of Americans, showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. The risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. Being overweight strains the joints, particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees, hips, and joints of the feet, causing the cartilage to wear away. Weight loss of at least 5% of body weight may decrease stress on the knees, hips, and lower back. In a study of osteoarthritis in a population in Framingham, Mass., researchers estimated that overweight women who lost 11 pounds or about two body mass index ( BMI) points, decreased their risk of osteoarthritis by more than 50%, while a comparable weight gain was associated with an increased risk of later developing knee OA. If you already have osteoarthritis, losing weight may help improve symptoms. If the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak, research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. Fortunately, even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles, the quadriceps, can reduce the risk. To strengthen quadriceps, Todd P. Stitik, MD, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, recommends isometric moves and wall slides. To do these, stand with your back to a wall, with feet shoulder-width apart. Then lean back against the wall, placing your feet out in front of you as far as you comfortably can. Bend at the knees, put your hands on your waist, and slide with your spine, maintaining contact with the wall until you reach a sitting position. ( Your knees should not bend more than 90 degrees). Then slowly slide back to your original position. Repeat eight to 10 times. If fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising, try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers. Doing so may make it easier to exercise and stay active. The safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints, such as bicycling, swimming, and other water exercise. Light weight lifting is another option, but if you already have osteoarthritis, first speak with your doctor. Suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. Injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. A long-term study of 1,321 graduates of Johns Hopkins Medical School found that people who injured a knee in adolescence or young adulthood were three times more likely to develop osteoarthritis in that knee, compared those who had not suffered an injury. People who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. To avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recommends the following: Avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. Keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. When jumping, land with knees bent. Do warm-up exercises before sports, even less vigorous ones such as golf. Cool down after vigorous sports. Wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. Exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. If you have a joint injury, it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage, such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. Although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis, certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. They include: Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats reduce joint inflammation, while unhealthy fats can increase it. Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils, including walnut, canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, and olive. Vitamin D. A handful of studies has shown that vitamin D supplements decreased knee pain in people with osteoarthritis. Your body makes most of the vitamin D it needs in response to sunlight. You can get more vitamin D in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and herring; vitamin D-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs. If you already have osteoarthritis, these same steps can be useful for reducing pain and other symptoms. In addition, there are many treatments your doctor can recommend or prescribe.

For many, the result is stiffness and pain in the joint. Although osteoarthritis (or OA) is more common as we age, it is not an inevitable part of aging. As researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis, they are able to offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and lessen its impact on your life.

Obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES), a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of Americans, showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. The risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. \u001b[92m[2] Being overweight strains the joints, particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees, hips, and joints of the feet, causing the cartilage to wear away\u001b[0m. Weight loss of at least 5% of body weight may decrease stress on the knees, hips, and lower back. In a study of osteoarthritis in a population in Framingham, Mass., researchers estimated that overweight women who lost 11 pounds or about two body mass index ( BMI) points, decreased their risk of osteoarthritis by more than 50%, while a comparable weight gain was associated with an increased risk of later developing knee OA. If you already have osteoarthritis, losing weight may help improve symptoms. If the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak, research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. Fortunately, even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles, the quadriceps, can reduce the risk. To strengthen quadriceps, Todd P. Stitik, MD, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, recommends isometric moves and wall slides. To do these, stand with your back to a wall, with feet shoulder-width apart. Then lean back against the wall, placing your feet out in front of you as far as you comfortably can. Bend at the knees, put your hands on your waist, and slide with your spine, maintaining contact with the wall until you reach a sitting position. ( Your knees should not bend more than 90 degrees). Then slowly slide back to your original position. Repeat eight to 10 times. If fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising, try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers. Doing so may make it easier to exercise and stay active. \u001b[92m[6] The safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints, such as bicycling, swimming, and other water exercise\u001b[0m.

{"ID": 84, "All Sources": ["Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI) causes serious problems with how you digest your food. Your pancreas makes enzymes that help break down the foods you eat so you can get nutrients, vitamins, and minerals from them. When you have EPI, your pancreas doesn't make enough of these enzymes. To help you digest foods more easily, you can get treatments that replace them. Other treatments help you manage symptoms like stomach pain or acid. Supplements can give your body extra doses of important vitamins and minerals to keep your weight up so you stay healthy. You also can treat the health problem that causes your EPI, like cystic fibrosis, Shwachman- Diamond syndrome, or chronic pancreatitis. You may get chronic pancreatitis if you have alcoholism or pancreatic stones. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (the doctor might refer to them as PERTs) are coated pills often made from pig pancreas juices. PERTs can help you better absorb fats from your foods, ease symptoms like stomach upset or oily stools, and just help you feel better overall. There are several prescription enzymes. If your doctor prescribes this medication, take it at the start of meals or before you eat snacks, along with a liquid like water. Don't dissolve the pill in a liquid like milk or take it with any over-the-counter stomach acid medicine that has calcium or magnesium. These products can break down the coating and enzymes in your pills. The amount you take depends on your body weight. You'll start with the lowest possible dosage and take more if you need it. You may also take drugs to lower stomach acid along with your PERT. Your doctor can prescribe these, and they're also available over the counter: Proton pump inhibitors like esomeprazole ( Nexium) or omeprazole H2 blockers like cimetidine ( Tagamet, Topcare), famotidine, or ranitidine Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can help you manage pain. Emotional stress can also trigger pancreas inflammation. Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline ( Pamelor) may help ease pain. Gabapentin ( Neurontin, Gralise),, a drug that helps control seizures, can also help fight EPI pain. Pregabalin ( Lyrica), which is used to treat seizures and nerve pain, also shows promise. EPI makes it hard for you to get the right nutrients because your body can't break down your foods. You might not get enough vitamin A, B12, D, E, and K, and you probably don't take in enough fats. Your doctor can prescribe vitamin supplements to help you get the right levels of these nutrients. She can also tell you which over-the-counter supplements and dosage to take. It's better for you to eat small meals more often than big ones that are hard to digest. Low fat may be easier on your system if you have a severe case. But if not, make sure you get enough calories and fats to help you stay at a healthy weight. Talk to a dietitian or nutritionist to help you choose the right foods or create meal plans. If you smoke or drink, it's time to stop. Alcohol and tobacco both make it harder for your pancreas to work. Alcoholism is one possible cause of EPI. Smoking can lead to calcium buildup in your pancreas. Cystic fibrosis. Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, antibiotics, laxatives, and enemas. You can also eat a high-calorie, high-fat diet or take supplements to get the nutrition you need. If you have cystic fibrosis and EPI, you may also get diabetes. Keep your blood sugar levels under control, and take insulin or other medications if your doctor prescribes them. Shwachman- Diamond syndrome. Your doctor may prescribe PERTs, a high-fat and high-calorie diet, and vitamins and supplements. Scientists are also working to see if stem cell transplants will treat this genetic disease. Chronic pancreatitis: If you have alcoholic pancreatitis, it's important to stop drinking. You may need to enter a treatment program or work with a counselor to stop. If you smoke, stop.

If you have a systemic illness like lupus or cystic fibrosis, treatment for the underlying condition may help the chronic pancreatitis. Yes. Surgery can open ducts that are clogged or blocked by gallstones, and decompression can widen a main pancreatic duct that's too narrow. Another option is to remove your pancreas and give you an autologous islet cell transplant. These are cells from your own body that make insulin. The doctor will get them into your body through a vein in your liver. This surgery can ease severe chronic pancreatitis pain or prevent or ease diabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis. But it's only used if other treatments haven't worked. If other treatments fail, the doctor might remove a portion of your pancreas, but this is usually a last resort."], "Quoted Output": "Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (PERTs) are \"coated pills often made from pig pancreas juices\" that help individuals with Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) \"better absorb fats from your foods, ease symptoms like stomach upset or oily stools, and just help you feel better overall.\" To assist in lowering stomach acid when taking PERT, \"You may also take drugs to lower stomach acid along with your PERT.\" Over-the-counter options include \"Proton pump inhibitors like esomeprazole (Nexium) or omeprazole\" and \"H2 blockers like cimetidine (Tagamet, Topcare), famotidine, or ranitidine.\"", "Paraphrased Output": "Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) consists of encapsulated enzymes derived from porcine pancreas, aiding individuals with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI) in the improved digestion and absorption of fats, alleviating symptoms such as gastrointestinal discomfort and steatorrhea, and enhancing overall well-being.

It's a \"silent\" problem with big implications, such as a four-fold increase in the likelihood of having a heart attack or stroke. A simple blood test is all it takes to check your triglyceride levels. If they're too high, you can get them back under control, often by changing your daily habits. If you already know that your triglyceride levels are too high, the actions you take now might even save your life. Having high triglycerides could be a sign that you're becoming insulin-resistant, which means your body isn't using insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar) properly. When insulin doesn't do its job, glucose can't get into your cells. That raises your blood sugar levels, which can lead to pre-diabetes and, eventually, type 2 diabetes. Having diabetes makes you much more likely to have a heart attack and other heart problems, in addition to the risk from your high triglycerides. Untreated diabetes is a major health threat. To manage it well, you may need to track everything you eat, test your blood sugar, exercise, lose extra weight, take medication as directed, and keep up with your medical appointments. Many people don't know that they have diabetes. Your doctor should check on whether you do, and if so, help you get both your diabetes and your triglycerides under control. High triglyceride levels can be a clue that you have fatty liver disease. Poor eating habits lead not only to high levels of fat in the bloodstream (triglycerides) but increased storage of fat throughout the body, including in the liver. Elevations in liver function tests (like ALT and AST) can indicate that fatty liver is present. Fatty liver usually does not cause symptoms, but unless reversed, fatty liver can lead to permanent liver damage and cirrhosis. If your triglyceride levels are \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery high\u00e2\u0080\u009d -- above 500 mg/d L -- you are more likely to get inflammation in your pancreas. Inflammation of the pancreas (a condition which doctors call pancreatitis) can cause permanent tissue damage. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, which may be severe.

Nebulizers are particularly effective in delivering asthma medications to infants and small children and to anyone who has difficulty using an asthma inhaler. It is also convenient when a large dose of an inhaled medication is needed. Nebulized therapy is often called a \"breathing treatment.\" And a variety of medications -- both for immediate relief and maintenance of asthma symptoms -- are available for use with a nebulizer. Nebulizers come in home (tabletop) and portable models. Home nebulizers are larger and must be plugged into an electrical outlet. Portable nebulizers run on batteries -- either disposable or rechargeable -- or can be plugged into a car's cigarette lighter. Smaller, portable units are slightly larger than a deck of cards, so they can be carried in a purse, briefcase, or backpack to be used whenever and wherever you need them. To obtain a nebulizer, you need a prescription from your doctor, or it can be dispensed from your pediatrician's office. ( Oftentimes, a breathing treatment is administered at the doctor's office.) Home nebulizers vary in cost, ranging from about $50 and up, plus the cost of accessories. Portable nebulizers usually cost a little more than home nebulizers. Both are usually covered under the durable medical equipment portion of health insurance policies. But, most insurance companies will require you to work with a specified durable medical equipment supplier. Check with your insurance company before purchasing or renting a nebulizer to ensure it will be covered. Your health care provider should be able to assist you with these arrangements. To use a nebulizer, you will need the following supplies: Air compressor Nebulizer cup Mask or mouthpiece Medication (either unit dose vials or bottles with measuring devices) Compressor tubing Once you have the necessary supplies: Place the air compressor on a sturdy surface that will support its weight. Plug the cord from the compressor into a properly grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet. Before asthma treatment, wash your hands with soap and water and dry completely. Carefully measure medications exactly as you have been instructed and put them into the nebulizer cup. Most medications today come in premeasured unit dose vials so measuring is not necessary. If you do measure, use a separate, clean measuring device for each medication. Assemble the nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece. Connect the tubing to both the aerosol compressor and nebulizer cup. Turn on the compressor to make sure it is working correctly. You should see a light mist coming from the back of the tube opposite the mouthpiece. Sit up straight on a comfortable chair. If the treatment is for your child, he or she may sit on your lap. If you are using a mask, position it comfortably and securely on your or your child's face. If you are using a mouthpiece, place it between your or your child's teeth and seal the lips around it. Take slow, deep breaths. If possible, hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before breathing out. This allows the medication to settle into the airways. Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (an average of 10 minutes). The nebulizer will make a sputtering noise, and the cup will have just a little medication remaining. If dizziness or jitteriness occurs, stop the treatment and rest for about 5 minutes. Continue the treatment, and try to breathe more slowly. If dizziness or jitteriness continues to be a problem with future treatments, inform your health care provider. During the treatment, if the medication sticks to the sides of the nebulizer cup, you may shake the cup to loosen the droplets. Your pediatrician should tell you the frequency of nebulizer use and how long you should use it. You should also be given an asthma action plan that explains which medications to use and when. Using a portable nebulizer is similar to using a home nebulizer, except that you don't need to plug it in. Most models are small enough to hold in your hand during use. Cleaning Cleaning and disinfecting your asthma nebulizer equipment is simple and very important. Proper care prevents infection. Cleaning should be done in a dust- and smoke-free area away from open windows. Follow these instructions when cleaning your nebulizer: After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess water, and let air dry. At the end of each day, the nebulizer cup, mask, or mouthpiece should be washed in warm soapy water using a mild detergent, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to air dry. You do not need to clean the compressor tubing. Every third day, after washing your equipment, disinfect the equipment using either a vinegar/water solution or the disinfectant solution your equipment supplier suggests. To use the vinegar solution, mix 1/2 cup white vinegar with 1 1/2 cups of water. Soak the equipment for 20 minutes and rinse well under a steady stream of water. Shake off the excess water and allow to air dry on a paper towel. Always allow the equipment to completely dry before storing in a plastic, zippered bag. Storing Cover the compressor with a clean cloth when not in use. Keep it clean by wiping it with a clean, damp cloth as needed. Do not put the air compressor on the floor either for treatments or for storage. Medications should be stored in a cool, dry place. Some medications require refrigeration and some require protection from light. Check them often. If they have changed color or formed crystals, throw them away and replace them with new ones. Other Tips Always have an extra nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece in case you need it. If you are given a nebulizer treatment in the doctor's office, be sure to ask for the tubing, cup, and mask. Check the air compressor's filter as directed.

Nebulizers are particularly effective in delivering asthma medications to infants and small children and to anyone who has difficulty using an asthma inhaler. It is also convenient when a large dose of an inhaled medication is needed. Nebulized therapy is often called a \"breathing treatment.\" And a variety of medications -- both for immediate relief and maintenance of asthma symptoms -- are available for use with a nebulizer. Nebulizers come in home (tabletop) and portable models. Home nebulizers are larger and must be plugged into an electrical outlet. Portable nebulizers run on batteries -- either disposable or rechargeable -- or can be plugged into a car's cigarette lighter. Smaller, portable units are slightly larger than a deck of cards, so they can be carried in a purse, briefcase, or backpack to be used whenever and wherever you need them. To obtain a nebulizer, you need a prescription from your doctor, or it can be dispensed from your pediatrician's office. ( Oftentimes, a breathing treatment is administered at the doctor's office.) Home nebulizers vary in cost, ranging from about $50 and up, plus the cost of accessories. Portable nebulizers usually cost a little more than home nebulizers. Both are usually covered under the durable medical equipment portion of health insurance policies. But, most insurance companies will require you to work with a specified durable medical equipment supplier. Check with your insurance company before purchasing or renting a nebulizer to ensure it will be covered. Your health care provider should be able to assist you with these arrangements. To use a nebulizer, you will need the following supplies: Air compressor Nebulizer cup Mask or mouthpiece Medication (either unit dose vials or bottles with measuring devices) Compressor tubing Once you have the necessary supplies: Place the air compressor on a sturdy surface that will support its weight. Plug the cord from the compressor into a properly grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet. Before asthma treatment, wash your hands with soap and water and dry completely. Carefully measure medications exactly as you have been instructed and put them into the nebulizer cup. Most medications today come in premeasured unit dose vials so measuring is not necessary. If you do measure, use a separate, clean measuring device for each medication. Assemble the nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece. Connect the tubing to both the aerosol compressor and nebulizer cup. Turn on the compressor to make sure it is working correctly. You should see a light mist coming from the back of the tube opposite the mouthpiece. Sit up straight on a comfortable chair. If the treatment is for your child, he or she may sit on your lap. If you are using a mask, position it comfortably and securely on your or your child's face. If you are using a mouthpiece, place it between your or your child's teeth and seal the lips around it. Take slow, deep breaths. If possible, hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before breathing out. This allows the medication to settle into the airways. Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (an average of 10 minutes). The nebulizer will make a sputtering noise, and the cup will have just a little medication remaining. If dizziness or jitteriness occurs, stop the treatment and rest for about 5 minutes. Continue the treatment, and try to breathe more slowly. If dizziness or jitteriness continues to be a problem with future treatments, inform your health care provider. During the treatment, if the medication sticks to the sides of the nebulizer cup, you may shake the cup to loosen the droplets. Your pediatrician should tell you the frequency of nebulizer use and how long you should use it. You should also be given an asthma action plan that explains which medications to use and when. Using a portable nebulizer is similar to using a home nebulizer, except that you don't need to plug it in. Most models are small enough to hold in your hand during use.

Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface. Washing more often than twice daily is not necessarily better; it may do more harm than good. Use warm, not hot, water and a mild facial cleanser. Using a harsh soap (like deodorant body soap) can hurt already inflamed skin and cause more irritation. Avoid scrubbing your skin harshly with a washcloth, an exfoliating glove, or loofah (a coarse-textured sponge). Gently wash it with a very soft cloth or your hands. Always rinse well, and then dry your face with a clean towel. ( Toss the towel in the laundry hamper, as dirty towels spread bacteria.) Also, use the washcloth only once. 2. Moisturize. Many acne products contain ingredients that dry the skin, so always use a moisturizer that minimizes dryness and skin peeling. Look for \"noncomedogenic\" on the label, which means it should not cause acne. There are moisturizers made for oily, dry, or combination skin. 3. Try an over-the-counter acne product. These acne products don't need a prescription. Most of them have ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid, which curb bacteria and dry your skin. They may cause drying or peeling so start with a small amount at first. Then you can adjust how much you use and how often. Another option is a new OTC topical retinoid gel ( Differin 0.1% gel). It works to actually keep the acne from forming. Use these products with caution if you have sensitive skin. 4. Use makeup sparingly. During a breakout, avoid wearing foundation, powder, or blush. If you do wear makeup, wash it off at the end of the day. If possible, choose oil-free cosmetics without added dyes and chemicals. Choose makeup that is labeled as \"noncomedogenic,\" meaning it should not cause acne. Read the ingredients list on the product label before buying. 5. Watch what you put on your hair. Avoid using fragrances, oils, pomades, or gels on your hair. If they get on your face, they can block your skin's pores and irritate your skin. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Oily hair can add to the oil on your face, so wash your hair often, especially if you're breaking out. Got long hair? Keep it pulled away from your face. 6. Keep your hands off your face. Avoid touching your face or propping your cheek or chin on your hands. Not only can you spread bacteria, you can also irritate the already inflamed facial skin. Never pick or pop pimples with your fingers, as it can lead to infection and scarring. 7. Stay out of the sun. The sun's ultraviolet rays can increase inflammation and redness, and can cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark discoloration). Some acne medications may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Limit your time in the sun, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and wear protective clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and a broad-brimmed hat. Whether you have pimples or not, always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with 6% zinc oxide or higher and SPF 30 or higher at least 20 minutes before sun exposure. Look for \"noncomedogenic\" on the sunscreen label to make new pimples less likely. Read the ingredients on the product label to know what you're putting on your skin. 8. Feed your skin. Most experts agree that certain foods, like chocolate, don't cause pimples. Still, it makes sense to avoid greasy food and junk food and add more fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains to your diet. Dairy products and foods high in processed sugar may trigger acne. Avoid these. 9. Exercise daily. Regular exercise is good for your whole body, including your skin. When you exercise, avoid wearing clothing or using exercise equipment that rubs your skin and may cause irritation. Shower or bathe right after exercise. 10. Chill!

Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface. Washing more often than twice daily is not necessarily better; it may do more harm than good. Use warm, not hot, water and a mild facial cleanser. Using a harsh soap (like deodorant body soap) can hurt already inflamed skin and cause more irritation. Avoid scrubbing your skin harshly with a washcloth, an exfoliating glove, or loofah (a coarse-textured sponge). Gently wash it with a very soft cloth or your hands. Always rinse well, and then dry your face with a clean towel. ( Toss the towel in the laundry hamper, as dirty towels spread bacteria.) Also, use the washcloth only once. 2. Moisturize. Many acne products contain ingredients that dry the skin, so always use a moisturizer that minimizes dryness and skin peeling. Look for \"noncomedogenic\" on the label, which means it should not cause acne. There are moisturizers made for oily, dry, or combination skin. 3. Try an over-the-counter acne product. These acne products don't need a prescription. Most of them have ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid, which curb bacteria and dry your skin. They may cause drying or peeling so start with a small amount at first. Then you can adjust how much you use and how often. Another option is a new OTC topical retinoid gel ( Differin 0.1% gel). It works to actually keep the acne from forming. Use these products with caution if you have sensitive skin. 4. Use makeup sparingly. During a breakout, avoid wearing foundation, powder, or blush. If you do wear makeup, wash it off at the end of the day. If possible, choose oil-free cosmetics without added dyes and chemicals. Choose makeup that is labeled as \"noncomedogenic,\" meaning it should not cause acne. Read the ingredients list on the product label before buying. 5. Watch what you put on your hair. Avoid using fragrances, oils, pomades, or gels on your hair. If they get on your face, they can block your skin's pores and irritate your skin. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Oily hair can add to the oil on your face, so wash your hair often, especially if you're breaking out. Got long hair? Keep it pulled away from your face. 6. Keep your hands off your face. Avoid touching your face or propping your cheek or chin on your hands. Not only can you spread bacteria, you can also irritate the already inflamed facial skin. Never pick or pop pimples with your fingers, as it can lead to infection and scarring. 7. Stay out of the sun. The sun's ultraviolet rays can increase inflammation and redness, and can cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark discoloration).

{"ID": 68, "All Sources": ["If you have mild to moderate Crohn's, your doctor may give you antibiotics to help keep your disease under control. You may need to take the antibiotics even after you feel better to keep your symptoms from getting worse again. There are two ways these drugs treat the inflammation in your gut from Crohn's. Researchers believe they might help control symptoms by reducing bacteria levels in your intestine and by curbing the intestine's immune system. You'll also get them to treat specific infections and complications. Abscesses. These are pockets of pus that, in Crohn's, often form near the anus. Fistulas. These are abnormal tunnels that go from one part of your intestine to another or to nearby areas, such as the bladder, vagina, anus, or skin. Pouchitis. For some people, Crohn's disease is so severe that they need an operation to have their colon removed. The surgeon makes an internal pouch to hold solid waste before it leaves your body. If this area becomes inflamed -- known as \"pouchitis\" -- you'll need antibiotics for treatment. The most common ones used for Crohn's are: Ciprofloxacin ( Cipro) Metronidazole ( Flagyl) Some people need to get antibiotics through a vein ( IV). Side effects of metronidazole may include: Nausea Loss of appetite Metallic taste Diarrhea Dizziness Headaches Dark urine Side effects are more common at higher doses. With metronidazole, you may also have numbness or tingling in your hands. If you do, you'll need to stop taking it. Although this side effect is rare, sometimes it doesn't go away. Seizures are another rare, serious side effect. Avoid alcohol if you're taking metronidazole. It can interact with the drug to cause a rare but severe reaction. The symptoms are nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. These side effects of ciprofloxacin are rare, but may include: Headache and severe dizziness Nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea Sensitivity to sun Rupture of a tendon (very rare) Confusion Depression Hallucinations Fast heartbeat You're also at greater risk for a severe type of colitis. If you get it, you'll need treatment with another type of antibiotic. Do not take ciprofloxacin within a couple of hours of taking: Antacids Vitamin or mineral supplements that contain calcium, iron, or zinc This combination can make the antibiotic less effective. No matter which antibiotic you're taking: Let your doctor know if you're pregnant before starting the medication. Wear sunscreen during daylight hours.

{"ID": 69, "All Sources": ["ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and the inability to control impulses. It affects an estimated 5.2 million school-age children in the U. S. Everyone, especially younger children, may have symptoms of ADHD from time to time. But with ADHD, the ability to function with daily activities is affected. A diagnosis of ADHD can be hard to make, and evaluation must be made by a specialist. There are several different approaches to treating ADHD. But research suggests that for many children, the best way to manage the symptoms is a multimodal approach. Multimodal treatment involves multiple methods of treatment that work together to help a child with ADHD. The main components of this approach are medications, behavioral therapy, and education. The most commonly prescribed medications for ADHD are stimulants. These include: Amphetamine ( Adzenys XR- ODT) Amphetamine/ Dextroamphetamine ( Adderall, Adderall XR) Dexmethylphenidate ( Focalin, Focalin XR) Dextroamphetamine ( Dexedrine or Dextrostat) Lisdexamfetamine ( Vyvanse) Methylphenidate ( Concerta, Daytrana, Metadate, Methylin, Quillivant XR, Ritalin) Some of these drugs may be available in longer-acting formulations. Non-stimulant medications used to treat ADHD, include: Atomoxetine ( Strattera) Clonidine ER ( Kapvay) Guanfacine ER ( Intuniv) ADHD medications are used to improve children's ability to concentrate and work. Sometimes, a doctor must prescribe different medications or different dosages before finding the best treatment for a child. Doctors and parents need to carefully monitor children taking medications for ADHD. Side effects of ADHD medicines can include: Anxiety Decreased appetite Fatigue Irritability Sleeping difficulties Skin discoloration (with patches) Upset stomach Most side effects are minor and improve with time. In some cases, doctors may lower a medication dosage to relieve side effects. The FDA recommends that a thorough medical history and exam, including an evaluation of underlying heart or psychiatric problems, be done as part of an ADHD treatment plan. A higher risk of strokes, heart attacks, and sudden death among patients with existing heart conditions has been linked to use of ADHD medications. An increased risk of psychiatric problems has also been linked to ADHD medications. The FDA has recently given approval to a device called Monach external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (e TNS) System to treat chilren age 7 to 12 years old. the cell phone-sized device delivers mild stimulation to electrodes which are attached to a patch worn on the oatient's forehead. Those electrical pulses interact with the part of the brain which is believed to be responsible for ADHD. Behavioral therapy is designed to help a child curb problematic behaviors. This may involve helping the child learn to organize time and activities. Or it could help a child complete homework. It may also involve helping the child control his or her impulses and responses to emotional stimuli. Educating parents about the disorder and its management is another important part of ADHD treatment. For parents, this may include learning parenting skills to help the child manage his or her behavior. That would involve skills such as giving positive feedback for desirable behaviors, ignoring undesirable behaviors, and giving time-outs when the child's behavior is out of control. In some cases, the child's entire family may be involved in this part of the treatment. Treatment guidelines call for behavior therapy as the preferred treatment for preschool children with ADHD. Medicine may be prescribed if further treatment is needed. For older children with ADHD, age 6 and older, an approach that includes both behavior therapy and medication is preferred. Researchers have found that multimodal treatment was particularly effective for improving social skills in children in highly stressful environments. It also was effective for those with anxiety and depression in addition to ADHD. Children who receive multimodal treatment may need lower doses of medications compared to children only receiving medication. A multimodal plan is effective for most children.

In some cases, the child's entire family may be involved in this part of the treatment. Treatment guidelines call for behavior therapy as the preferred treatment for preschool children with ADHD. Medicine may be prescribed if further treatment is needed. For older children with ADHD, age 6 and older, an approach that includes both behavior therapy and medication is preferred. Researchers have found that multimodal treatment was particularly effective for improving social skills in children in highly stressful environments. It also was effective for those with anxiety and depression in addition to ADHD. Children who receive multimodal treatment may need lower doses of medications compared to children only receiving medication.

Right now, there isn't anything you can change about your lifestyle to specifically keep you from getting one of these digestive problems that's written into your genes. Research into the complex relationship is ongoing, and there's a lot more still to be learned. Here's what we know so far. There's a strong link between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. IBD includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis ( UC). Crohn's can affect any part of the stomach and intestines; UC usually affects the lower parts of your GI tract, the colon and rectum. After looking at the gene patterns of tens of thousands of people with serious autoimmune diseases, scientists are finding that the same problem genes can be responsible for psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. These conditions trigger inflammation in similar ways, too. Your skin and intestines are organs made up of tissue that absorbs things more easily, so it's not surprising that both are sensitive and react to the inflammation signals that travel throughout your body. One study found that 1 in 10 women with psoriasis develop an IBD. ( The odds were even higher for those with psoriatic arthritis, another condition linked with psoriasis.) People with psoriasis are 2.5 times more likely to get Crohn's and 1.6 times more likely to get UC. Some people get a digestive disorder first and psoriasis later. IBD and psoriasis also share a connection with obesity. Fat tissue seems to make chemicals that change how the body works, including the immune system. Having a lot of extra weight raises your odds of having psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. It can also make them get worse faster and make treatments less effective. When you have celiac disease, you can't digest gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease can damage your small intestine and prevent it from absorbing key nutrients. The chance of getting celiac disease is nearly 3 times higher among people with psoriasis. About 4 of every 100 have it. Research shows that the higher the levels of specific antibodies related to celiac disease, the worse psoriasis tends to be. Watch for signs of digestive issues, and tell your doctor so you can get tested and change your treatment plan, if needed. IBD ( Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) symptoms include: Diarrhea Belly cramps Blood in your poop Celiac disease or gluten sensitivity symptoms in adults may include: Diarrhea Bad-smelling poop Fatigue Feeling weak, dizzy, or short of breath Cold hands and feet Sore, achy joints You might mistake celiac disease for psoriatic arthritis, because both can cause joint pain and fatigue. Your doctor can order a blood test that measures levels of antibodies to check whether gluten affects you. It's often helpful to have a specialist called a gastroenterologist as well as a dermatologist on your health care team. You and your team can decide what treatment is right for you based on what and how severe your symptoms are and the medication side effects you're willing to deal with.

Following a gluten-free diet has helped some people clear their psoriasis lesions as well as manage celiac. What's more, going gluten-free has helped people who test positive for a gluten sensitivity even when they don't have any celiac symptoms or signs of the disease.

Maybe she has been shaking her head a lot, or scratching at her ears. Perhaps you\u2019ve even spotted some yellow or black ear discharge or noticed a bit of a smell. Could your cat have an ear problem? Ear problems in cats are quite common. It\u2019s also common for people to misdiagnose their cat\u2019s ear issues, sometimes leading to weeks of inappropriate treatment. Save her the pain and discomfort -- learn what ear problems might be troubling your cat, and find out what you can do to help. When your cat\u2019s ears are healthy, they\u2019re pink and clean inside, have no smell, have very little or no wax, and seem able to detect the sound of a can opener from a mile away. When your feline friend has ear problems, you may notice a much different kitty. Symptoms of ear problems in cats include pawing at the ears, sensitivity to touch, a large amount of cream colored, orange, dark brown, or black wax; hearing loss; head tilting or shaking; and loss of balance. The most common causes of ear discharge in cats include: Ear mites . So tiny you usually need a microscope to see them, ear mites are the most common cause of cat ear problems, and they can be very irritating to your cat. An ear mite infestation can get so bad, that along with a lot of head shaking, your cat may scratch hard enough to create bloody sores; an ear infection may result. Ear infections . This is serious business. Ear infections are not only extremely uncomfortable for your cat, but if left untreated they can lead to permanent deafness or a need for surgery. Ear infections in cats can be caused by many things, including bacteria, yeast, even a piece of debris caught in her ear canal. Other causes . Ear discharge in cats may result from other problems, including food or inhalant allergies, wax buildup, tumors, polyps, drug reactions, a hereditary condition, or immune system issues. The only way to truly know what\u2019s troubling your cat is to take her to the vet for an examination. Depending on what your veterinarian finds, treatment for your cat\u2019s ear discharge might include: Treating cat ear mites . Ear mites can thrive inside your cat\u2019s ear, munching on ear wax and skin oils. Your veterinarian will probably diagnose an ear mite infection by checking a sample of your cat\u2019s ear wax under a microscope. Treatment for ear mites generally includes a good ear cleaning and topical prescription medication. For uncooperative cats, injectable medication is also available. Ear mites can be very contagious among pets, so if you discover your cat has them, you may want to get the rest of your household\u2019s four-legged friends checked by a vet, too. Chances are good your entire pet household will need ear mite treatment or an infestation may easily recur. Treating cat ear infections . How you treat a cat\u2019s ear infection depends on what\u2019s causing the infection. To make things more complicated, sometimes your cat may have more than one type of infection in her ears. After examining your cat and possibly sending a swab out to a lab for analysis, your veterinarian may prescribe a range of treatments for your cat\u2019s ear infection, including antibiotics, antifungal medication, anti-inflammatories, or immunotherapy. Treating other ear problems . Treatment options for other problems that may lead to ear discharge -- such as allergies, polyps, or drug reactions -- is wide-ranging and may include supplements, drops, immunotherapy shots, a change to their food or medications, or surgery. To help your cat\u2019s ears stay perky and pest-free, \u001b[92m check inside her ears regularly for signs of wax buildup, inflammation, or odor\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m If you notice a problem, it\u2019s time to talk to your veterinarian\u001b[0m.

{"ID": 76, "All Sources": ["It depends on how long you've been taking it and why. Here are some facts to help you decide: You may be taking HRT to relieve menopause symptoms. At one time, doctors also used to prescribe HRT to manage diseases like osteoporosis and heart disease in women past menopause. But in 2002, a Women's Health Initiative study found that women who took the most common form of HRT, a combined estrogen and progesterone pill, had a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and blood clots. HRT and Menopause Symptoms: Research shows that a small dose of HRT is still the best way to reduce uncomfortable symptoms in early menopause. Women younger than age 60 have the lowest risks of other health problems from using HRT. Several years of treatment is usually enough to relieve symptoms. So if you've been on HRT for more than 5 years, talk with your doctor about tapering off. But you should remember that after stopping, you can expect the hot flushes to return. HRT and Heart Disease: Doctors no longer prescribe hormones to manage heart disease or other chronic conditions like osteoporosis. If you're taking HRT to reduce the risk of heart disease, ask your doctor about gradually stopping it. Before the WHI study, doctors prescribed HRT for heart problems. Some earlier studies showed that women who took hormones had lower rates of heart disease and other chronic diseases. The women may have just been healthier and had better access to medical care. The WHI study and follow-ups confirmed that HRT didn't reduce the risk of heart disease; it increased it in healthy, postmenopausal women. HRT and Osteoporosis: As with heart disease, you should weigh the benefits of using hormones with other risks. To reduce osteoporosis, doctors often suggest lifestyle changes such as regular weight-bearing exercise. You can also try medicine like Fosamax and Evista, or calcium and vitamin D supplements. Or you may look at other choices, such as statins, which reduce cholesterol in the blood, but also treat osteoporosis and heart disease. Experts are still not sure. You and your doctor should talk about which form of HRT might be right for you. Low-dose hormone replacement therapy: Studies show that lower doses of hormone replacement therapy offer the same benefits without as many risks. In a new study by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where the WHI research took place, women who took low-dose estrogen had 53% fewer hot flashes and night sweats. Estrogen alone: This is the suggested treatment for women who've had a hysterectomy to remove their uterus. Women who take estrogen alone have fewer risks of breast cancer and other disorders. Still, doctors caution that taking estrogen alone can increase your risk of stroke and uterine cancer. Bio-identical estrogen patches, creams, or vaginal rings: These forms of estrogen are similar to what the body makes. Unlike a pill, they enter the body through the skin or walls of the vagina. In this way, they bypass the liver, reducing the risk of serious blood clots or gallbladder disease. There is still a risk of both, but it will be less than if you were taking the equivalent dose of oral hormones. Soy or black cohosh: Soy and black cohosh supplements contain phytoestrogens, plant materials that may act like estrogen in the body. Some studies haven't found any proof that these \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural\u00e2\u0080\u009d therapies reduce menopause symptoms. Supplements aren't regulated or approved by the FDA, and phytoestrogens may increase risks for certain diseases. Antidepressants : Studies show antidepressants like Prozac and Effexor reduce hot flashes. One study found that venlafaxine, the main ingredient in Effexor, reduced hot flashes and night sweats by 48%. The results were similar to those for low-dose estrogen but without the risks. Lifestyle changes: Here are some other ways to cope with menopause symptoms: Dress in layers so you can remove clothes as needed. Avoid hot and spicy foods and beverages. Use cotton sheets, and wear clothes that allow your skin to breathe. Limit caffeine and alcohol. Use relaxation techniques such as yoga. Don't smoke. Get regular exercise.

Here are some facts to help you decide: You may be taking HRT to relieve menopause symptoms. At one time, doctors also used to prescribe HRT to manage diseases like osteoporosis and heart disease in women past menopause. But in 2002, a Women's Health Initiative study found that women who took the most common form of HRT, a combined estrogen and progesterone pill, had a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and blood clots. HRT and Menopause Symptoms: Research shows that a small dose of HRT is still the best way to reduce uncomfortable symptoms in early menopause. Women \u001b[92m younger than age 60\u001b[0m \u001b[92m have the lowest risks of other health problems from using HRT\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m Several years of treatment is usually enough to relieve symptoms\u001b[0m. So \u001b[92m if you've been on HRT for more than 5 years, talk with your doctor about tapering off\u001b[0m. But you should remember that after stopping, you can expect the hot flushes to return. HRT and Heart Disease: Doctors no longer prescribe hormones to manage heart disease or other chronic conditions like osteoporosis. If you're taking HRT to reduce the risk of heart disease, ask your doctor about gradually stopping it. Before the WHI study, doctors prescribed HRT for heart problems. Some earlier studies showed that women who took hormones had lower rates of heart disease and other chronic diseases. The women may have just been healthier and had better access to medical care. The WHI study and follow-ups confirmed that HRT didn't reduce the risk of heart disease; it increased it in healthy, postmenopausal women. HRT and Osteoporosis: As with heart disease, you should weigh the benefits of using hormones with other risks. To reduce osteoporosis, doctors often suggest lifestyle changes such as regular weight-bearing exercise. You can also try medicine like Fosamax and Evista, or calcium and vitamin D supplements. Or you may look at other choices, such as statins, which reduce cholesterol in the blood, but also treat osteoporosis and heart disease. Experts are still not sure. You and your doctor should talk about which form of HRT might be right for you. Low-dose hormone replacement therapy: Studies show that lower doses of hormone replacement therapy offer the same benefits without as many risks. In a new study by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where the WHI research took place, women who took low-dose estrogen had 53% fewer hot flashes and night sweats. Estrogen alone: This is the suggested treatment for women who've had a hysterectomy to remove their uterus. Women who take estrogen alone have fewer risks of breast cancer and other disorders. Still, doctors caution that taking estrogen alone can increase your risk of stroke and uterine cancer. Bio-identical estrogen patches, creams, or vaginal rings: These forms of estrogen are similar to what the body makes. Unlike a pill, they enter the body through the skin or walls of the vagina. In this way, they bypass the liver, reducing the risk of serious blood clots or gallbladder disease. There is still a risk of both, but it will be less than if you were taking the equivalent dose of oral hormones. Soy or black cohosh: Soy and black cohosh supplements contain phytoestrogens, plant materials that may act like estrogen in the body. Some studies haven't found any proof that these \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural\u00e2\u0080\u009d therapies reduce menopause symptoms. Supplements aren't regulated or approved by the FDA, and phytoestrogens may increase risks for certain diseases. Antidepressants : Studies show antidepressants like Prozac and Effexor reduce hot flashes. One study found that venlafaxine, the main ingredient in Effexor, reduced hot flashes and night sweats by 48%. The results were similar to those for low-dose estrogen but without the risks. Lifestyle changes: Here are some other ways to cope with menopause symptoms: Dress in layers so you can remove clothes as needed. Avoid hot and spicy foods and beverages. Use cotton sheets, and wear clothes that allow your skin to breathe. Limit caffeine and alcohol. Use relaxation techniques such as yoga. Don't smoke. Get regular exercise. Don't forget to check with your doctor. The best plan for you might be to do nothing at all."], "Quoted Output": "To determine when to stop taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause, consider that \"if you've been on HRT for more than 5 years, talk with your doctor about tapering off.\" Individual health factors influencing the duration of HRT include being \"younger than age 60\" as these women \"have the lowest risks of other health problems from using HRT.\" Signs that HRT can be stopped include when \"several years of treatment is usually enough to relieve symptoms.\"", "Paraphrased Output": "Deciding when to discontinue hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause involves consulting with your healthcare provider, especially if you have been undergoing HRT for over five years.

So it's no surprise that many people have back problems from time to time. The hurt can stem from sore muscles, ligaments, and tendons, or from herniated disks, fractures, and other problems in your upper, middle, and lower back. Sometimes you feel the effects right away. But in many cases, back problems develop over time. We often bring on our back problems through bad habits, such as: Poor posture, like sitting incorrectly at a desk or behind the steering wheel Repeating the same motion or overdoing it Pushing, pulling, and lifting things carelessly The spine is actually a stack of 24 bones called vertebrae. A healthy spine is S-shaped when viewed from the side. It curves back at your shoulders and inward at your neck and small of your back. It houses and protects your spinal cord, the network of nerves that transmit feeling and control movement throughout your entire body. One of the more common types of back pain comes from straining the bands of muscles surrounding the spine. It happens most often in the curve of the low back and the base of the neck. These areas support more weight than your upper and mid back, which are less prone to trouble. Injuries from contact sports, accidents, and falls can cause problems ranging from minor muscle strains, to herniated disks, to fractures that damage to the spinal column or cord. Stabbing low back pain could be from muscle spasms, when your muscles seize up and don't relax, like a cramp. Osteoarthritis can affect your vertebrae, when the cartilage between them wears down. Bone spurs or a herniated disk can push on nerves. Pregnancy often brings on back pain, too. Hormonal changes and weight gain put new kinds of stresses on a pregnant woman's spine and legs. Sometimes your back might be sore for no clear reason. That's called nonspecific backache. It could come from weak muscles that can't handle everyday walking, bending, and stretching. Back pain -- whether a dull ache or shooting -- is just one sign that something's going on with your back. You may also have feelings in your legs or arms: Radiating pain Numbness Tingling Weakness Uncontrolled peeing or pooping could mean a serious problem like spinal cord compression. Call your doctor right away. You should see a doctor: After you get hurt, like in a fall or accident When the pain gets in the way of your daily activities If it lasts longer than 6 weeks, or spreads During your exam, your doctor will test your range of motion -- unless you can't move -- and check how well your nerves are working. That may be enough to decide what to do next. You might need imaging tests, like X-rays, an MRI, or a CT scan. But they're not always useful, and there's not always a direct link between the results of these tests and how much it hurts. Your specific treatment will depend on what's causing your pain and where in your back it is. Despite what you may think or have been told before, staying in bed isn't usually the answer; gentle exercise is. It will help work out the kinks, build support for your spine, and improve your flexibility. A physical therapist can work with you to design a set of exercises, give you relief from the pain, and get you moving again. Over-the-counter pain relievers, ice, and heat will work to take the edge off most back pain. Your doctor can prescribe stronger medicines, but some can make you drowsy or dependent on them if you're not careful. Complementary therapies, such as chiropractic spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage, can help ease pain, too. If a bone is damaged, or you have a herniated disk or pinched nerve, you may need surgery. But for ongoing back pain, doctors will try other treatments first. Counseling could help you learn to live with chronic pain better as well as deal with symptoms of depression because of it. Exercise! Strengthening the muscles around your spine and in your core will help keep you stable and balanced. Walking is great for your low back, and it's simple to do. Practice good posture. As a rule of thumb, aim to keep your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned when you sit, stand, and walk. Lift heavy things correctly, using your hips and knees for power while keeping your back straight. Try sleeping on your side, with a medium-firm mattress. Don't smoke.

It's your body's main structural support. It needs to keep you stable enough to stand upright but flexible enough for movement. So it's no surprise that many people have back problems from time to time. The hurt can stem from sore muscles, ligaments, and tendons, or from herniated disks, fractures, and other problems in your upper, middle, and lower back. Sometimes you feel the effects right away. But in many cases, back problems develop over time. We often bring on our back problems through bad habits, such as: Poor posture, like sitting incorrectly at a desk or behind the steering wheel Repeating the same motion or overdoing it Pushing, pulling, and lifting things carelessly The spine is actually a stack of 24 bones called vertebrae. A healthy spine is S-shaped when viewed from the side. It curves back at your shoulders and inward at your neck and small of your back. It houses and protects your spinal cord, the network of nerves that transmit feeling and control movement throughout your entire body. One of the more common types of back pain comes from straining the bands of muscles surrounding the spine. It happens most often in the curve of the low back and the base of the neck. These areas support more weight than your upper and mid back, which are less prone to trouble. Injuries from contact sports, accidents, and falls can cause problems ranging from minor muscle strains, to herniated disks, to fractures that damage to the spinal column or cord. Stabbing low back pain could be from muscle spasms, when your muscles seize up and don't relax, like a cramp. Osteoarthritis can affect your vertebrae, when the cartilage between them wears down. Bone spurs or a herniated disk can push on nerves. Pregnancy often brings on back pain, too. Hormonal changes and weight gain put new kinds of stresses on a pregnant woman's spine and legs. Sometimes your back might be sore for no clear reason. That's called nonspecific backache. It could come from weak muscles that can't handle everyday walking, bending, and stretching. Back pain -- whether a dull ache or shooting -- is just one sign that something's going on with your back. You may also have feelings in your legs or arms: Radiating pain Numbness Tingling Weakness \u001b[92m Uncontrolled peeing or pooping could mean a serious problem like spinal cord compression\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m Call your doctor right away\u001b[0m. You should see a doctor: \u001b[92m After you get hurt, like in a fall or accident\u001b[0m \u001b[92m When the pain gets in the way of your daily activities\u001b[0m \u001b[92m If it lasts longer than 6 weeks, or spreads\u001b[0m During your exam, your doctor will test your range of motion -- unless you can't move -- and check how well your nerves are working. That may be enough to decide what to do next. You might need imaging tests, like X-rays, an MRI, or a CT scan. But they're not always useful, and there's not always a direct link between the results of these tests and how much it hurts. Your specific treatment will depend on what's causing your pain and where in your back it is. Despite what you may think or have been told before, staying in bed isn't usually the answer; gentle exercise is. It will help work out the kinks, build support for your spine, and improve your flexibility. A physical therapist can work with you to design a set of exercises, give you relief from the pain, and get you moving again. Over-the-counter pain relievers, ice, and heat will work to take the edge off most back pain.

Probably 95% of knee pain caused by arthritis is osteoarthritis, which is caused by \u00e2\u0080\u009cwear and tear\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the joints.

They're usually twisting injuries to the knee: ACL, meniscus, or ligament injuries. What's the difference? The main difference between arthritis and other kinds of knee pain is there's no trauma associated with it. A person who tore their ACL or had a meniscus injury knows exactly when it happened. With arthritis, it's more of a dull, aching pain. It gets worse as time goes on. Will my pain go away on its own? It depends. Arthritis pain tends to wax and wane over time. It may not completely go away, but sometimes it feels much better. Pain from an injury improves at first, but if you're left with a sore joint, you may not be able to do certain activities. When do I need to see a doctor? Everyone has a different pain threshold. If you've an injury and your knee swells, you need to see your doctor. Even if the swelling goes away, you need to have your knee examined -- you might have injured something inside the joint.

The key is to work closely with your doctor and follow your treatment plan so you and your baby can both stay healthy. If you're thinking about becoming pregnant, it's a good idea to make sure your Crohn's is in remission first. You have a better chance of a smooth pregnancy when your disease isn't flaring or when you haven't started a new treatment. Talk to both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist. Here are some things you may discuss before becoming pregnant: Medications for Crohn's don't usually affect a woman's chance of becoming pregnant. But some treatments -- such as sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) -- can affect a man's fertility. So men with Crohn's who hope to become fathers should talk to their doctors about changing medication. If you take methotrexate, your doctor will suggest you stop before your pregnancy. The drug can harm the baby. Men, too, should stop taking the drug several months before conception. If you are taking steroids, your doctor may suggest you wait to become pregnant. If you've had surgery for Crohn's you can still have a healthy pregnancy, but it may be harder to get pregnant. If you are thinking about having surgery, talk to your doctor. You may want to put off surgery until after your pregnancy. When you're pregnant, have regular visits with both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist to monitor your baby's health and your Crohn's. You should see a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine, because pregnancy with Crohn's is considered high risk. Some women say their Crohn's symptoms actually improve when they're pregnant and they have fewer flares. Make sure your doctors are aware of all the medications you are taking. If you're on a drug treatment plan that works for you, they may suggest you stay on it, but they may also suggest some changes to keep you and your baby safe. Tell your doctor if you take steroids, immunosuppressives, biologics, or even antibiotics, or anti-diarrhea drugs. You'll need to stop certain types of these drugs. Some medications, like sulfasalazine and other drugs in the aminosalicylate class, are considered safe while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. If you are thinking of becoming pregnant, you should consider adding folic acid supplements to your diet even before conception. These supplements will be needed throughout your pregnancy. You may need tests to monitor your Crohn's while you're pregnant. Some are OK, but there are other tests you may want to put off until after your baby is born. Your doctor can guide you on this decision. Ultrasounds, MRIs, and fetal monitoring devices are considered safe. If you are on steroids or have moderate to severe flares while pregnant, you may have frequent ultrasounds to check on your baby's growth. X-rays and CT scans may be necessary during pregnancy. To limit radiation exposure, abdominal shielding can be used. It's considered safe to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy, where a tube with a camera is placed in your colon to look for any problems. It is probably not a good idea to have a colonoscopy. The tests take a long time and patients usually get drugs to put them to sleep. You should also avoid X-rays and CT scans if possible. The radiation isn't good for a developing baby. Discuss your labor and delivery plans with your doctor well before your due date. If you have fistulas, abnormal passageways between organs, or other areas around your vagina or rectum that have been affected by Crohn's, your doctor may recommend you have a C-section.

These vessels will be described more fully later in this section. This blood is relatively low in oxygen and relatively high in carbon dioxide, since much of the oxygen has been extracted for use by the tissues and the waste gas carbon dioxide was picked up to be transported to the lungs for elimination. From the right atrium, blood moves into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs for gas exchange. This system of vessels is referred to as the pulmonary circuit. The single vessel exiting the right ventricle is the pulmonary trunk. At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve, which prevents backflow of blood into the right ventricle during ventricular diastole. As the pulmonary trunk reaches the superior surface of the heart, it curves posteriorly and rapidly bifurcates (divides) into two branches, a left and a right pulmonary artery. To prevent confusion between these vessels, it is important to refer to the vessel exiting the heart as the pulmonary trunk, rather than also calling it a pulmonary artery. The pulmonary arteries in turn branch many times within the lung, forming a series of smaller arteries and arterioles that eventually lead to the pulmonary capillaries. The pulmonary capillaries surround lung structures known as alveoli that are the sites of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. Once gas exchange is completed, oxygenated blood flows from the pulmonary capillaries into a series of pulmonary venules that eventually lead to a series of larger pulmonary veins.

{"ID": 241, "All Sources": ["Now that we\u2019ve looked at what 'fore' is used for, let\u2019s take a look at why this word is used. What does it stand for and how did it come to be so widely known? Well, the honest answer is that no one knows exactly how this term came to be a universal golf warning. While no one is sure where exactly the term came from, we do know that it has been used for a very long time and that there are many theories. The British Golf Museum cites a reference to the term from 1881. Also, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary states that the term got its start in 1878, but there is some debate over that date. Theory 1: ", "The tough rubber core of a golf ball makes it a hazard to others following a wayward shot, despite its weight not exceeding 1.620 oz (45.9 g). 'Fore!', originally a Scots interjection, is used to warn anyone standing or moving in the flight of a golf ball. The etymology of the word in this usage is uncertain. Mention of the term in an 1881 British Golf Museum indicates that the term was in use at least as early as that period. A possible origin of the word is the term 'fore-caddie', a caddie waiting down range from the golfer to find where the ball lands. These caddies were often warned about oncoming golf balls by a shout of the term 'fore-caddie' which was eventually shortened to just 'fore!'. The Colonel Bogey March is based on the descending minor third which the original Colonel Bogey whistled instead of yelling 'fore' around 1914.

A possible origin of the word is \u001b[96m the term 'fore-caddie', a caddie waiting down range from the golfer to find where the ball lands\u001b[0m. These caddies were often warned about oncoming golf balls by a shout of the term 'fore-caddie' which was eventually shortened to just 'fore!'. The Colonel Bogey March is based on the descending minor third which the original Colonel Bogey whistled instead of yelling 'fore' around 1914. ", "Like many other golf terms, the origin of 'fore' is not entirely known. There is no doubt that it was first used in Scotland, where the game of golf was invented, even as early as the 1850s. But there is disagreement about where it came from. Some think it comes from the golf term 'forecaddie', which is a person that stands in a forward position on each golf hole to pinpoint where the players\u2019 balls go. 'Forecaddies' are often in the line of fire and need to be warned when a ball is flying toward them. \u001b[95m The other potential origin comes from the British military\u001b[0m. \u001b[95m Artillery men used to shout 'beware before' in advance of firing their cannons in order to warn their fellow soldiers standing nearby\u001b[0m.

While the daytime soap villain had been killed off the CBS series only two months ago, Monday's episode revealed that she was actually alive this whole time as head writer Brad Bell reversed his decision on the fan-favorite character's fate. It turns out that the woman killed by Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) in the pivotal February episode was actually Sheila's lookalike Sugar (also played by Brown), who first debuted on The Young and the Restless. ", "https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/tv/who-bold-beautifuls-sheila-carter-442517\nSheila was a reoccurring character, but she's made a few different stints on the interlocked soaps, causing her to be portrayed by a few different actresses over the years. She first appeared on the Young and the Restless in 1990 played by Kimberlin Brown. She ran consistently on the show up until 1998, taking a few years off before coming back for 2002-2003. She switched over to the Young and the Restless in 2005-2007. Kimberly played the role until 2006 where Michelle Stafford stepped up to the plate. Michelle's take over was explained by Sheila getting plastic surgery to look like Phyllis Summers, a character from the Young and the Restless. Kimberlin returned to her original role for a stint in 2017-2018 and has now played the character from 2021 until now. She's actively playing the actress as the writers explore the current crazy plot line. What are Sheila Carter's aliases?

{"ID": 244, "All Sources": ["macOS has supported three major processor architectures, beginning with PowerPC-based Macs in 1999. In 2006, Apple transitioned to the Intel architecture with a line of Macs using Intel Core processors. In 2020, Apple began the Apple silicon transition, using self-designed, 64-bit Arm-based Apple M series processors on the latest Macintosh computers. As of 2024[update], the most recent release of macOS is macOS 15 Sequoia. History Development Main article: macOS version history The heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, before being launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of FreeBSD and other BSD operating systems. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language. Throughout the 1990s, Apple had tried to create a 'next-generation' OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all were eventually abandoned. This led Apple to acquire NeXT in 1997, allowing NeXTSTEP, later called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for Apple's next generation operating system. ", "With its original introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the classic Mac OS. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other. Many aspects of macOS's architecture are derived from OPENSTEP, which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, NeXTSTEP was ported from the original 68k-based NeXT workstations to x86 and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple, and OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project. ", "Because macOS is POSIX compliant, many software packages written for the other Unix-like systems including Linux can be recompiled to run on it, including many scientific and technical programs. Third-party projects such as Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. Apple and others have provided versions of the X Window System graphical interface which can allow these applications to run with an approximation of the macOS look-and-feel. The current Apple-endorsed method is the open-source XQuartz project; earlier versions could use the X11 application provided by Apple, or before that the XDarwin project. ", "The history of macOS, Apple's current Mac operating system formerly named Mac OS X until 2011 and then OS X until 2016, began with the company's project to replace its 'classic' Mac OS. That system, up to and including its final release Mac OS 9, was a direct descendant of the operating system Apple had used in its Mac computers since their introduction in 1984.

A portrait of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States (1801\u20131809), is featured on the obverse of the note. The reverse features an engraving of John Trumbull's painting Declaration of Independence (c.\u20091818). Throughout the $2 bill's pre-1929 life as a large-sized note, it was issued as a United States Note, a National Bank Note, a Silver Certificate, a Treasury or 'Coin' Note, and a Federal Reserve Bank Note. When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, in 1928, the $2 bill was redesigned and issued only as a United States Note. Production continued until 1966 (1967), when United States Notes were phased out; the $2 denomination was discontinued until 1976, when it was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note, with a new reverse design. ", "Authorized under an act by the United States Congress, the first two-dollar bill was issued in March 1862 and the denomination was continuously used until 1966; by that time, the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency to which the two-dollar bill was assigned. In August 1966, the Treasury Department discontinued production of the $2 and $5 denominations of United States Notes. While the $5 denomination had been issued simultaneously as a Federal Reserve Note, a United States Note and a Silver Certificate, the $2 denomination was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency, thus was fully discontinued. The Treasury cited low usage of the two-dollar bill as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination. Production of the two-dollar denomination was resumed in December, 1975, and the two-dollar bill was finally reissued in the spring of 1976 as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence, replacing the previous design of Monticello. The two-dollar note has remained a current denomination of U.S. currency since that time. As estimated at the time, if two-dollar notes replaced about half of the one-dollar notes in circulation, the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ($139 million adjusted for inflation) over the period from 1976 to 1981, due to reduced production, storage, and shipping costs. Printing $2 bills is half as expensive for the government as printing $1 notes, since they both cost the same amount (6.2 cents per bill) to manufacture, but the public has not circulated them as widely. During the Great Depression, few Americans had enough money to require $2 notes. In the middle of the 20th century, $2 bills supposedly acquired a negative reputation as they were allegedly widely used for controversial transactions such as betting on horse racing, tips at strip clubs, and allegedly for bribery when politicians were seeking votes (though these accounts are possibly an urban legend). During World War II and later, US servicemen were frequently paid with $2 bills, and as a result, the notes often were used at military facilities such as USO clubs, post exchanges, commissaries, and canteens. Many people believe that the 1976 series $2 note with its unusual reverse design was a special, limited issue produced for the United States Bicentennial; this, combined with the earlier discontinuation of the denomination, gave the impression these notes might be valuable as collector's items, and contributed to hoarding. Today, the general public is still largely unfamiliar with the notes because they are not widely circulated and continue to be hoarded. The common misconception that the $2 note is no longer being produced also remains, though $2 notes have been printed since 1862, except for a 10-year hiatus between 1966 and 1976. The U.S. Treasury reports that $1,549,052,714 worth of $2 bills were in circulation worldwide as of April 30, 2007. Certain conventions and tourism/convention bureaus capitalize on the scarcity of $2 notes in circulation, encouraging convention attendees and tourists to spend the bills to illustrate to the host communities the economic impact that the conventions and tourism bring. Sometimes known as 'SpendTom' campaigns, the $2 bills linger in the community as a constant reminder. Some campaigns encourage people to participate in a hunt for the bills to win prizes. History Large-sized notes (approximately 7.4218 in \u00d7 3.125 in \u2245 189 mm \u00d7 79 mm) In March 1862, the first $2 bill was issued as a Legal Tender Note (United States Note) with a portrait of Alexander Hamilton; the portrait of Hamilton used was a profile view, different from the familiar portrait in use on the small-sized $10 bill since 1928. By 1869, the $2 United States Note was redesigned with the now-familiar portrait of Thomas Jefferson to the left and a vignette of the United States Capitol in the center of the obverse. This note also featured green tinting on the top and left side of the obverse. Although this note is technically a United States Note, TREASURY NOTE appeared on it instead of UNITED STATES NOTE. The reverse was completely redesigned. This series was again revised in 1874; changes on the obverse included removing the green tinting, adding a red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C., and changing the term TREASURY NOTE to UNITED STATES NOTE. The 1874 design was also issued as Series of 1875 and 1878, and by 1880, the red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C. on the United States Note was removed and the serial numbers were changed to blue. This note with the red floral design was also issued as Series of 1917 but with red serial numbers by that time. ", "Two-dollar Treasury, or 'Coin', Notes were first issued for government purchases of silver bullion in 1890 from the silver mining industry. The reverse featured large wording of TWO in the center and a numeral 2 to the right surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note. In 1891, the reverse of the Series of 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too 'busy', making it too easy to counterfeit. More open space was incorporated into the new design. In 1896, the 'Educational Series' Silver Certificate was issued. The entire obverse of the note was covered in artwork with an allegorical figure of science presenting steam and electricity to commerce and manufacture. The reverse of the note featured portraits of Robert Fulton and Samuel F. B. Morse surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note. By 1899, however, The $2 Silver Certificate was redesigned with a small portrait of George Washington surrounded by allegorical figures representing agriculture and mechanics. Large-sized Federal Reserve Bank Notes were issued in 1918. Each note was an obligation of the issuing Federal Reserve Bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank. The obverse of the note featured a borderless portrait of Thomas Jefferson to left and wording in the entire center. The reverse featured a World War I battleship. First $2 bill issued in 1862 as a Legal Tender Note. Series 1886 $2 Silver Certificate depicting Winfield Scott Hancock Series 1890 featuring James McPherson.

The obverse featured a cropped version of Thomas Jefferson's portrait that had been on previous $2 bills. The reverse featured Jefferson's home, Monticello. As with all United States Notes, the treasury seal and serial numbers were printed in red ink. The Series of 1928 $2 bill featured the treasury seal superimposed by the United States Note obligation to the left and a large gray TWO to the right.

India ranks second worldwide in farm outputs. As per the Indian economic survey 2020 -21, agriculture employed more than 50% of the Indian workforce and contributed 20.2% to the country's GDP. In 2016, agriculture and allied sectors like animal husbandry, forestry and fisheries accounted for 17.5% of the GDP (gross domestic product) with about 41.49% of the workforce in 2020. India ranks first in the world with highest net cropped area followed by US and China. The economic contribution of agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining with the country's broad-based economic growth. Still, agriculture is demographically the broadest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall socio-economic fabric of India. ", "India exported $39 billion worth of agricultural products in 2013, making it the seventh largest agricultural exporter worldwide, and the sixth largest net exporter. This represents explosive growth, as in 2004 net exports were about $5 billion. India is the fastest growing exporter of agricultural products over a 10-year period, its $39 billion of net export is more than double the combined exports of the European Union (EU-28). It has become one of the world's largest supplier of rice, cotton, sugar and wheat. India exported around 2 million metric tonnes of wheat and 2.1 million metric tonnes of rice in 2011 to Africa, Nepal, Bangladesh and other regions around the world. ", "As with rice, the lasting benefits of improved seeds and improved farming technologies now largely depends on whether India develops infrastructure such as irrigation network, flood control systems, reliable electricity production capacity, all-season rural and urban highways, cold storage to prevent spoilage, modern retail, and competitive buyers of produce from Indian farmers. This is increasingly the focus of Indian agriculture policy. India ranks 74 out of 113 major countries in terms of food security index. India's agricultural economy is undergoing structural changes. Between 1970 and 2011, the GDP share of agriculture has fallen from 43% to 16%. This isn't because of reduced importance of agriculture or a consequence of agricultural policy; rather, it is largely due to the rapid economic growth in services, industrial output, and non-agricultural sectors in India between 2000 and 2010.

The biggest problem of farmers is the low price for their farm produce. A recent study showed that proper pricing based on energy of production and equating farming wages to Industrial wages may be beneficial for the farmers. Infrastructure ", "Although India has attained self-sufficiency in food staples, the productivity of its farms is below that of Brazil, the United States, France and other nations. Indian wheat farms, for example, produce about a third of the wheat per hectare per year compared to farms in France. Rice productivity in India was less than half that of China. Other staples productivity in India is similarly low. Indian total factor productivity growth remains below 2% per annum; in contrast, China's total factor productivity growths is about 6% per annum, even though China also has smallholding farmers. Several studies suggest India could eradicate its hunger and malnutrition and be a major source of food for the world by achieving productivity comparable with other countries.[citation needed] By contrast, Indian farms in some regions post the best yields, for sugarcane, cassava and tea crops.

People began to question the treatment of workers and animals in this new industrial era, leading to the first organized animal advocacy efforts. Who Started the First Animal Rights Movement?

EA gained prominence in the 21st century and quickly spread to philanthropic spaces, including the animal rights movement. The first group solely dedicated to effective animal advocacy, Effective Animal Activism, was founded in 2012 as an intern project of 80,000 Hours\u2014a U.K.-based organization that guides individuals toward high-impact careers. Effective Animal Activism sought to improve animal welfare as much as possible, despite the lack of evidence-based guidance on the most effective ways to do so. Growth of Effective Animal Advocacy ", "Brief History of the Animal Protection Movement In the UK, the first legislation \u2018Martin\u2019s Act\u2019 for the protection of animals (mainly cattle and horses) was passed in 1822. Two years later, in 1824, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (which became the Royal SPCA in 1840) was established. The society focused especially on enforcement of the law, with prosecutions where appropriate. In 1835, the Act was amended to protect domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, against cruelty. The first American animal protection organization, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was established in 1866. By 1900, several hundred other animal protection organizations had formed in America. In 1860, the Battersea Dogs\u2019 Home was established by Mr. Mary Tealby, the first woman to found a British animal welfare organization. The organization was the first place to provide a home for stray dogs, in order to end their miserable lives on the streets.

Public demonstrations, protests, and petitions were organized. The release and removal of animals from laboratories or factory farms, sabotage of hunting, laboratories and breed establishments begun in the 1970s and continue today. Such events have provided a controversial topic to magnify public awareness of the animal rights issue. From the 1970s, the movement also started to split into two categories - animal welfare and animal rights. Those who believe in animal rights believe in an animal's natural right to life. They seek to establish basic rights for animals and stop the use/exploitation of animals by humans. Those who believe in animal welfare tend to accept human use of animals, providing that use is humane. ", "In the last few decades, some organizations in Europe and North America have started to extend their focus from purely national issues to include international aspects (particularly tackling graphic and higher profile issues such as: fur, whaling, sealing, bear farming/baiting/dancing, bush meat and dog eating). The World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) extended its work to include the coordination of international campaigns (with its first international campaign being the \u2018No-Fur campaign which started in 1988). These international advocacy campaigns sometimes involved different animal welfare organizations in different countries working together on joint campaign and lobby activities. Through these activities, many countries who were new to animal welfare advocacy gained the awareness and capacity to develop their own animal welfare advocacy agendas. There were also specific \u2018capacity building\u2019 programs, which assisted the development of fledgling animal welfare organizations in \u2018developing\u2019 and \u2018transition\u2019 countries.

During the first decades of the 20th century, the movement focused their attention on practical programs largely connected to horse, dog and cat welfare activities, urban animal control, and educational work on pet keeping. Their animal control activities made it difficult for them to advocate against the cruel treatment of animals in other contexts. After a period of considerable vitality, the movement lost ground during World War I (as it did in Europe), and animal welfare issues dropped from public and media concern. In the second half of the 20th century, there was a revival of the movement in the USA. Discontent with existing organizations\u2019 restricted mandates and their readiness to negotiate with organizations such as the biomedical research community (who had begun to turn to municipal shelters for cheap sources of dogs and cats in the 1940s to meet increased demand for such experiments) led to intra-organizational disputes and the emergence of breakaway groups. The Animal Welfare Institute was formed in 1951 and The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in 1954. These soon charted a new course, fuelling the renewal of the movement.

There were legislative advances \u2013 including the Humane Slaughter Act (1958) and the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) (1966) - although these were largely achieved through political connections, rather than organized advocacy. However, animal welfare was finally gaining a place on the US political landscape. Wildlife concerns became prominent platforms for several of the organizations that joined the field in the late 1950s and 1960s.

During the first decades of the 20th century, the movement focused their attention on practical programs largely connected to horse, dog and cat welfare activities, urban animal control, and educational work on pet keeping. Their animal control activities made it difficult for them to advocate against the cruel treatment of animals in other contexts. After a period of considerable vitality, the movement lost ground during World War I (as it did in Europe), and animal welfare issues dropped from public and media concern. In the second half of the 20th century, there was a revival of the movement in the USA. Discontent with existing organizations\u2019 restricted mandates and their readiness to negotiate with organizations such as the biomedical research community (who had begun to turn to municipal shelters for cheap sources of dogs and cats in the 1940s to meet increased demand for such experiments) led to intra-organizational disputes and the emergence of breakaway groups. The Animal Welfare Institute was formed in 1951 and The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in 1954. These soon charted a new course, fuelling the renewal of the movement. ", "\u001b[0;33;47m From 1975 this began to change, as a period of mobilization and transformation took place\u001b[0m. Some of the existing organizations began to work more strategically, using a base of research and planning. They also increasingly used the language of rights and liberation. They also linked with newer animal advocates. On example of such co-operation was Henry Spira (who had a lifetime of experience in the labor, civil rights, peace and women\u2019s movements) who interacted with new ethical contacts \u2013 including Peter Singer. In the early 1980s, an important wave of group formation and movement expansion commenced. Several key conferences gave rise to new organizations and generated considerable momentum toward the development of a national grassroots movement. Local organizations also organized, knitting themselves together as larger state or regional coalitions. From about 1984 activists began to employ civil disobedience measures, and the movement\u2019s reliance on sit-ins, site blockage, and similar tactics expanded steadily through the rest of the decade. National days of action were undertaken, to focus on high-priority issues. Casework and investigations added to the pressure. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (1981) set the standard for such work. When other groups began to adopt the investigative approach as well, it had an energizing effect. Animal welfare organizations then began to attract knowledgeable staff at both national and local level, which enhanced their ability to serve the cause effectively. Different form of professional recruitment aided the movement\u2019s growth and outreach. Animal-interest caucuses began to form among attorneys, biologists, medical doctors, nurses, veterinarians, and psychologists, to name the most visible.

{"ID": 249, "All Sources": ["'It Ain't Me' is a song by Norwegian DJ Kygo and American singer Selena Gomez. It was released by Interscope Records, Sony and Ultra on 16 February 2017 as the lead single from Kygo's debut extended play Stargazing (2017) and appears as an international bonus track on Gomez's third studio album, Rare (2020). The song was written by Kygo, Gomez, Brian Lee, Ali Tamposi, and Andrew Watt and produced by Kygo, Watt and Louis Bell. An EDM, dance-pop, electropop and tropical house song, 'It Ain't Me' comprises an acoustic guitar line, and a build-drop arrangement in its chorus featuring pulsing piano notes, bass, synthesizers, finger-snap claps and pan flute melodies. Gomez sings the track in a husky tone, while in the chorus her vocals are reduced to recurring syllables. The lyrics narrate a past relationship ruined by alcoholism. The lyrics to 'It Ain't Me' were written by Andrew Watt, Brian Lee and Ali Tamposi. With Watt previously working with Kygo, the DJ's manager Myles Shear contacted Watt for a session with Kygo which Watt also facilitated for Lee and Tamposi. During their session for 'It Ain't Me', they initially found the track very poor, but were trying to salvage it. Kygo and Shear suggested that they continue working on the song. After Kygo and Shear had left, Tamposi told Watt and Lee to play guitar and 'Fleetwood Mac it', spawning a 45-minute jam session as well as the demo of 'It Ain't Me', a simple acoustic guitar recording with Tamposi on vocals. Watt, Lee and Tamposi then asked Kygo to return to their studio to hear 'It Ain't Me' for a second time. Tamposi recalled, 'When they pushed the space bar to play the song, [Kygo] went from this very sweet, polite, charming young man to this super-human producer guy. I was watching his eyes go back, left and right, just mapping out how he envisioned the production of the song. He was extremely excited'. Lee and Tamposi then left for Kygo and Watt to work on the production where they followed the melodies and message of the demo. According to Tamposi, the producers brought the song to life. 'It Ain't Me' is an EDM, dance-pop, electropop and tropical house song. According to the official sheet music at Musicnotes.com, 'It Ain't Me' is composed in the key of A minor and is set in the time signature of alla breve at a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Gomez's vocal range spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of E5, while the music follows the chord progression of Am\u2013C\u2013F\u2013C\u2013F\u2013C\u2013G. Later in the song, the piano plays in a chord progression of: Am\u2013C\u2013G\u2013F\u2013Am\u2013C\u2013G. The song carries a calm tone and a drop common in tropical house music, but is complemented by an equal measure of electronic and pop rock elements. The track starts with a folk-like acoustic guitar riff. It is followed immediately by Gomez singing the first verse in a husky tone. As the song develops, a steady bass and synthesizers are heard. The production is subtle and varied with finger snaps sometimes being louder than the kick drum, and the guitar riff and piano notes alternating in and out. In the chorus, Gomez is accompanied by background vocals that pertain to the sound of a choir. ", "In early February 2017, 'It Ain't Me' was registered on the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) database. Gomez first teased the single with two Instagram stories on 3 February 2017. The first teaser showed a half-profile of the singer with a black 'X' over her mouth as a 10-second snippet plays with the lyrics, 'I had a dream / we were back to 17 / summer nights and The Libertines / never growing up,' while the second teaser was a snippet of the song's beat. Gomez later revealed the single's cover art and release date on Instagram on 13 February 2017, and shared three teasers of the song on Snapchat the following day. 'It Ain't Me' was released for digital download by Interscope, Sony and Ultra Music on 17 February 2017 as the first single from Kygo's upcoming second studio album. Interscope was the primary label since it is Gomez's label. A remix of the song featuring actor Vin Diesel was released on Facebook on 18 February 2017. 'It Ain't Me' was sent to contemporary hit radio in the US on 28 February 2017. 'It Ain't Me' received positive reviews from music critics. Matt Medved of Billboard regarded it as one of Gomez's most mature-sounding releases and appreciated Kygo's usage of her vocals, adding that the song showed both collaborators' 'best sides'. Similarly, Alexia Hernandez of Entertainment Weekly deemed it 'perhaps her most mature tune to date'. In The New York Times, Jon Pareles described the song as a 'righteous kiss-off', commending its subtle and varied production. Pedro Pincay of Vibe magazine said Kygo and Gomez 'cooked up something special'. Kat Bein of Billboard ranked 'It Ain't Me' atop her list of ten best Kygo songs, writing that Gomez's 'powerful and strong' vocals took 'Kygo's collaborative vocal game to a whole new level' and the chorus arrangement brought 'a certain edginess new to Kygo's catalogue', concluding that the song showed growth and 'maybe heralds a new era of Kygo's sound'. In a negative review, Pitchfork described it as 'yet another exercise in EDM guys reducing female vocalists to anonymities,' deeming it inferior to Gomez's follow-up single 'Bad Liar'. Chart performance In the US, 'It Ain't Me' debuted at number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100, selling 19,000 copies and accumulating 1.7 million streams in its first day. Following its first full week of tracking, the song climbed to number 12, aided by sales of 67,000 copies, 15.5 million streams and a 19 million airplay audience. 'It Ain't Me' became Kygo's highest-charting single in the US, surpassing the number 92 peak of his 2014 single 'Firestone', and marked Gomez's seventh top 10 entry in less than four years, continuing her 'chart hot streak' according to Gary Trust of Billboard magazine. As of May 2017, the song has sold 484,000 copies in the United States. It peaked at number 10 making it Kygo's first top 10 and Gomez's seventh top 10 overall. A music video, directed by Philip R. Lopez, was released on 24 April 2017 on Kygo's official Vevo channel. The video revolves around a young couple involved in a motorcycle crash. The boyfriend is rendered comatose. The video depicts the boyfriend's unconscious state, with the girlfriend dancing and singing by his bedside at the hospital. At the end of the video, the boyfriend wakes up but his girlfriend is not there. Instead a butterfly sits on his forehead, symbolizing that his girlfriend had died in the accident and was accompanying him in his comatose state from the afterlife. The music video was shot in High Bridge, New Jersey. Neither Kygo nor Gomez appear in the video. Usage in media The song is featured in tenth episode of the television series The Bold Type.

Jan & Dean also covered the track on their Folk 'n Roll LP in 1965. Influences Dylan's biographers generally agree that the song owes its inspiration to his former girlfriend Suze Rotolo.

With Watt previously working with Kygo, the DJ's manager Myles Shear contacted Watt for a session with Kygo which Watt also facilitated for Lee and Tamposi. During their session for 'It Ain't Me', they initially found the track very poor, but were trying to salvage it. Kygo and Shear suggested that they continue working on the song. After Kygo and Shear had left, Tamposi told Watt and Lee to play guitar and 'Fleetwood Mac it', spawning a 45-minute jam session as well as the demo of 'It Ain't Me', a simple acoustic guitar recording with Tamposi on vocals. Watt, Lee and Tamposi then asked Kygo to return to their studio to hear 'It Ain't Me' for a second time. Tamposi recalled, 'When they pushed the space bar to play the song, [Kygo] went from this very sweet, polite, charming young man to this super-human producer guy. I was watching his eyes go back, left and right, just mapping out how he envisioned the production of the song. He was extremely excited'. Lee and Tamposi then left for Kygo and Watt to work on the production where they followed the melodies and message of the demo. According to Tamposi, the producers brought the song to life. 'It Ain't Me' is an EDM, dance-pop, electropop and tropical house song.

Later in the song, the piano plays in a chord progression of: Am\u2013C\u2013G\u2013F\u2013Am\u2013C\u2013G. The song carries a calm tone and a drop common in tropical house music, but is complemented by an equal measure of electronic and pop rock elements. The track starts with a folk-like acoustic guitar riff. It is followed immediately by Gomez singing the first verse in a husky tone. As the song develops, a steady bass and synthesizers are heard. The production is subtle and varied with finger snaps sometimes being louder than the kick drum, and the guitar riff and piano notes alternating in and out.

A Federal regulation that interprets the Act excludes from the definition of 'public possession,' possession 'for an established religious purpose; when accompanied by a parent, spouse or legal guardian age 21 or older; for medical purposes when prescribed or administered by a licensed physician, pharmacist, dentist, nurse, hospital or medical institution; in private clubs or establishments; or to the sale, handling, transport, or service in dispensing of any alcoholic beverage pursuant to lawful employment of a person under the age of twenty-one years by a duly licensed manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer of alcoholic beverages',  [23 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.3]. FEDERAL CITATIONS AND RELEVANT TEXT EXCERPTS 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. National minimum drinking age. ", "The alcohol laws of the United States regarding minimum age for purchase have changed over time. In colonial America, generally speaking, there were no purchase ages, and alcohol consumption by young teenagers was common, even in taverns. In post-Revolutionary America, such freedom gradually reduced due to religious sentiments (as embodied in the temperance movement) and a growing recognition in the medical community about the dangers of alcohol. The more modern history is given in the table below. Unless otherwise noted, if different alcohol categories have different minimum purchase ages, the age listed below is set at the lowest age given (e.g. if the purchase age is 18 for beer and 21 for wine or spirits, as was the case in several states, the age in the table will read as '18', not '21'). In addition, the purchase age is not necessarily the same as the minimum age for consumption of alcoholic beverages, although they have often been the same. As one can see in the table below, there has been much volatility in the states' purchase ages since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. Shortly after the ratification of the 21st amendment in December, most states set their purchase ages at 21 since that was the voting age at the time. Most of these limits remained constant until the early 1970s. From 1969 to 1976, some 30 states lowered their purchase ages, generally to 18. This was primarily because the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1971 with the passing into law of the 26th amendment. Many states started to lower their minimum purchase age in response, most of this occurring in 1972 or 1973. Twelve states kept their purchase ages at 21 since repeal of Prohibition and never changed them. From 1976 to 1983, several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 (or, less commonly, 20 or 21), in part to combat drunk driving fatalities.[citation needed] In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current purchase age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the purchase ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the Tenth Amendment. Although debates have not been highly publicized, a few states have proposed legislation to lower their purchase age, while Guam raised its purchase age to 21 in July 2010. Minimum legal purchase age as of 1969 (two years before the 26th Amendment was enacted in 1971):Minimum legal purchase age as of 1975 (when most states had their lowest age limit):Detail on dual age limits Both age limits apply for following states: Illinois: The legal purchase age is 19 for beer and wine, and 21 for liquor.Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.: The legal purchase age is 18 for beer and wine, and 21 for liquor.Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota: The legal purchase age is 18 for 3.2% ABV beer, and 21 for beer stronger than 3.2% ABV, wine, and liquor.Minimum legal purchase age as of 1983 (one year before the National Minimum Drinking Age Act was passed):  Minimum age is 21  Minimum age is 20  Minimum age is 19 and 21  Minimum age is 19  Minimum age is 18 and 21  Minimum age is 18 State Pre-Prohibition(prior to 1919) Post-Prohibition(after 1933) 1970s / 26th Amendment(adopted in 1971) 1980s / Drinking Age Act of 1984 21st century 1987:Raised to 21 de jure in 1987,but de facto age was still 18 until 1995 due to a sale loophole.1995:De facto age raised to 21 in 1995 when loophole was closed.1996:In 1996, briefly lowered by Louisiana Supreme Court to 18 until it reversed its decision, raising to 21 three months later.Other exceptions still remain. 21 (Exceptions to state law include): *For an established religious purpose; *When a person under twenty-one years of age is accompanied by a parent, spouse, or legal guardian twenty-one years of age or older; *For medical purposes when purchased as an over the counter medication, or when prescribed or administered by a licensed physician, pharmacist, dentist, nurse, hospital, or medical institution; *In a private residence, which shall include a residential dwelling and up to twenty contiguous acres, on which the dwelling is located, owned by the same person who owns the dwelling; ", "In the 1960s the age for buying or drinking beer and wine in the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) was 18; the age for hard liquor was 21. Residents from Virginia and Maryland would often drive to D.C. to obtain alcohol. In Louisiana, the 1987 law raising the age from 18 to 21 was deliberately written solely to comply with the National Minimum Drinking Age Act to avoid losing highway funding, while still allowing 18- to 20-year-olds to drink as before. Not only did it still allow 18- to 20-year-olds to consume in private, it contained a major loophole allowing bars and stores to sell alcohol to 18- to 20-year-olds without penalty (despite purchase being technically illegal) which meant that the de facto age was still 18. In other words, the purchase age was 21 only on paper. This loophole was closed in 1995, but in 1996 the Louisiana Supreme Court declared a purchase age of 21 unconstitutional. That briefly lowered the de jure purchase age to 18, causing an uproar which prompted the Louisiana Supreme Court to reverse its decision, raising the age to 21 three months later. Other exceptions still remain to this day, including drinking in a private residence, and Louisiana still has some of the most liberal general alcohol laws of any state. Some states were 'dry' well before national Prohibition was enacted in 1919, in some cases since achieving statehood. Also, some states did not become fully 'wet' until several years after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 (e.g. Mississippi in 1966). Since 1966, all states and territories of the USA have been 'wet', but dry counties and towns still exist in some states. References ^ a b Rorabaugh, William (1979).

However, another constitutional amendment would soon pass that changed the landscape once again. In 1971, Congress passed the 26th Amendment, which lowered the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. Following suit, most states lowered their MLDA leaving only 14 states with a MLDA of 21. After a spike in fatal car crashes amongst teenagers, researchers began to analyze the data. Most concluded that there was a direct correlation between the lowered MLDA and increase of teenage alcohol related deaths and accidents. Advocacy groups such as MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) began campaigning for states to raise the MLDA to 21. Their efforts were successful in some states, but numerous states resisted pressure to change their drinking laws. ", "Even with this flexibility for the States, Congress retains the power to use financial and tax incentives to promote certain alcohol policies, such as the minimum legal drinking age. The Federal Uniform Drinking Age Act of 1984 sets the minimum legal drinking age to 21 and every State abides by that standard. According to this Act, the Federal government can withhold ten percent of Federal funding for highways from States that do not prohibit people under age 21 from buying or publically possessing any alcoholic beverage.  While every State abides by this standard, State law varies on specifics about possession and exceptions to the law, such as allowing people under 21 to drink with their parents.

Residents from Virginia and Maryland would often drive to D.C. to obtain alcohol. In Louisiana, the 1987 law raising the age from 18 to 21 was deliberately written solely to comply with the National Minimum Drinking Age Act to avoid losing highway funding, while still allowing 18- to 20-year-olds to drink as before. Not only did it still allow 18- to 20-year-olds to consume in private, it contained a major loophole allowing bars and stores to sell alcohol to 18- to 20-year-olds without penalty (despite purchase being technically illegal) which meant that the de facto age was still 18. In other words, the purchase age was 21 only on paper. This loophole was closed in 1995, but in 1996 the Louisiana Supreme Court declared a purchase age of 21 unconstitutional. That briefly lowered the de jure purchase age to 18, causing an uproar which prompted the Louisiana Supreme Court to reverse its decision, raising the age to 21 three months later. Other exceptions still remain to this day, including drinking in a private residence, and Louisiana still has some of the most liberal general alcohol laws of any state. Some states were 'dry' well before national Prohibition was enacted in 1919, in some cases since achieving statehood. Also, some states did not become fully 'wet' until several years after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 (e.g. Mississippi in 1966). Since 1966, all states and territories of the USA have been 'wet', but dry counties and towns still exist in some states. References ^ a b Rorabaugh, William (1979).

The majority of the states, with a few exceptions, set their MLDA to 21. However, another constitutional amendment would soon pass that changed the landscape once again. In 1971, Congress passed the 26th Amendment, which lowered the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. Following suit, most states lowered their MLDA leaving only 14 states with a MLDA of 21. After a spike in fatal car crashes amongst teenagers, researchers began to analyze the data. Most concluded that there was a direct correlation between the lowered MLDA and increase of teenage alcohol related deaths and accidents. Advocacy groups such as MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) began campaigning for states to raise the MLDA to 21. Their efforts were successful in some states, but numerous states resisted pressure to change their drinking laws. ", "https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-policy\nEven with this flexibility for the States, Congress retains the power to use financial and tax incentives to promote certain alcohol policies, such as the minimum legal drinking age. The Federal Uniform Drinking Age Act of 1984 sets the minimum legal drinking age to 21 and every State abides by that standard. According to this Act, the Federal government can withhold ten percent of Federal funding for highways from States that do not prohibit people under age 21 from buying or publically possessing any alcoholic beverage.  While every State abides by this standard, State law varies on specifics about possession and exceptions to the law, such as allowing people under 21 to drink with their parents.

In colonial America, generally speaking, there were no purchase ages, and alcohol consumption by young teenagers was common, even in taverns. In post-Revolutionary America, such freedom gradually reduced due to religious sentiments (as embodied in the temperance movement) and a growing recognition in the medical community about the dangers of alcohol. The more modern history is given in the table below. Unless otherwise noted, if different alcohol categories have different minimum purchase ages, the age listed below is set at the lowest age given (e.g. if the purchase age is 18 for beer and 21 for wine or spirits, as was the case in several states, the age in the table will read as '18', not '21'). In addition, the purchase age is not necessarily the same as the minimum age for consumption of alcoholic beverages, although they have often been the same. As one can see in the table below, there has been much volatility in the states' purchase ages since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. Shortly after the ratification of the 21st amendment in December, most states set their purchase ages at 21 since that was the voting age at the time. Most of these limits remained constant until the early 1970s. From 1969 to 1976, some 30 states lowered their purchase ages, generally to 18. This was primarily because the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1971 with the passing into law of the 26th amendment. Many states started to lower their minimum purchase age in response, most of this occurring in 1972 or 1973. Twelve states kept their purchase ages at 21 since repeal of Prohibition and never changed them.

(November 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The Olympic Games are considered to be the world's foremost international sporting event with over 200 nations participating. It historically had the highest costs and expenses for the hosts, with the estimated cost of the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro being at approximately US$11.1 billion. Sports-related costs since 1960 have been on average $5.2 billion (USD) for the Summer Games and $393.1 million dollars (USD) for the Winter Games. The highest recorded total cost was that of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, costing approximately US$55 billion. The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Games experienced the biggest loss recorded at approximately $2 billion (USD). Costs The current highest cost of hosting the Olympic Games was the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Games, costing approximately US$11.1 billion. In order to meet the requirements set out by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Rio de Janeiro council had to invest heavily in building the necessary facilities/venues, and an entirely new subway line. The lack of a solid infrastructure to support these investments led to the council underestimating their costs by 25%. The costs of hosting the Olympic Games can be classified into 2 categories: infrastructure and operational costs. Infrastructure This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) General infrastructure The costs of general infrastructure consist of preparing the necessary infrastructure to accommodate the influx of tourists and athletes in the host city. The International Olympic Committee requires a minimum of 40,000 hotel rooms available for visiting spectators and an Olympic Village that is able to house 15,000 athletes, referees, and officials. Internal and external transportation facilities that can transport spectators into and out of the host city and from venue to venue are also required by the Committee. These requirements are often met through renovations to already-built facilities or construction of entirely new facilities. These facilities include train/subway lines, roads, and airports. Sports infrastructure ", "Once the necessary infrastructure is put in place, the Olympics require a large amount of spending on operating costs throughout the duration of the Games. Historically, the most significant operating costs for the hosts have been in event management, organization and preparation of the opening and closing ceremonies, and increasingly in recent years, security. Table The table below lists the costs of hosting the Olympic Games. Due to the multitude of reporting methods, the table contains both the operating costs and total final costs (which include various infrastructure upgrades and security costs), as well as both known and not estimated figures. Net loss or gain are measured against the operating budgets. Intangible costs (such as to the environment and society) and benefits (through tourism) are not included here. Olympiad Host Final OperatingBudget Total Costs Taxpayer Contribution Profit/Loss Year Debt Paid Off Notes 1896 Summer Olympics Athens 3,740,000 \u20af ", "The modern Olympics has become an exceptionally expensive affair. Each of the past five Summer Olympics and both of the most recent Winter Games have resulted in total costs for the host cities of over $10 billion with the 2008 Beijing Summer Games exceeding $45 billion in total costs and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics topping $50 billion. Even the explosion of international sponsorship deals and global media rights has not been able to keep up with the skyrocketing costs of the event. For example, the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, which cost the governments and organizers in Brazil at least $13 billion, generated at most $9 billion in revenue, much of which was kept by the IOC and was therefore unable to be used to defray the expenses associated with hosting. Most empirical studies of past Olympic Games have shown only modest, if any, increases in economic activity due to increased tourism during the event that could be used to economically justify the cost of the Olympics. The decrease in normal tourists, resulting from those seeking to stay away from Olympic congestion, high prices, and security issues, may neutralize any increase from Olympic tourism.

", "There are numerous reasons why the Olympics have become such an expensive affair. From somewhat modest beginnings 125 years ago, the Summer Olympics have grown to encompass nearly 12,000 athletes from over 200 countries competing in over 300 events. The Winter Olympics are comprised of nearly 3,000 competitors from 92 countries taking part in over 100 events. The sheer size of these events contributes to a high price tag and almost ensures that no single city will have the venues already in place required to host the Games. Additionally, many sports require specialized infrastructure that will both need to be constructed specifically for the Olympics and also have limited use following the Games. Indeed, the problem of 'white elephants,' i.e., underused and abandoned venues post-Olympics, has plagued recent hosts. Host cities for the Summer Games must have 40 sporting venues, an Olympic Village to house 16,000 athletes, coaches, and trainers, a massive international media center as well as a media village, and transportation and parking to facilitate movement among these venues. Ceremonial space and parkland are also needed, requiring thousands of dedicated acres of scarce urban real estate to host the Games.  To make room for all this, invariably people have to be pushed aside, displacing thousands, or in Beijing\u2019s case over a million, local residents from their homes.

And that\u2019s being conservative, the researchers noted, adding they did not include indirect capital costs such as improvements to roads, rail, airports, hotels, and other infrastructure not directly associated with the operations of the games. By Zimbalist\u2019s estimates (which include operating costs and direct and indirect infrastructure costs), the games themselves grew increasingly extravagant: Beijing spent more than $40 billion for the 2008 Summer Games, Sochi spent upward of $50 billion for the 2014 Winter Games and Rio\u2019s costs approached $20 billion for the 2016 Summer Olympics, he wrote. 'One of the big issues, whether you\u2019re looking at the question of surplus or deficit, or some other strictly financial question, is that if you really want to know how much money is spent, and how much money comes in, you simply have to include everything,' Zimbalist told CNN in an interview.

Most empirical studies of past Olympic Games have shown only modest, if any, increases in economic activity due to increased tourism during the event that could be used to economically justify the cost of the Olympics. The decrease in normal tourists, resulting from those seeking to stay away from Olympic congestion, high prices, and security issues, may neutralize any increase from Olympic tourism. Indeed, net tourism has fallen during several recent Olympic Games, such as London in 2012 by five percent or Beijing in 2008 by over twenty percent.

On the third or fourth of May I saw a loon in the pond, and during the first week of the month I heard the whip-poor-will, the brown thrasher, the veery, the wood pewee, the chewink, and other birds. I had heard the wood thrush long before. The ph\u0153be had already come once more and looked in at my door and window, to see if my house was cavern-like enough for her, sustaining herself on humming wings with clinched talons, as if she held by the air, while she surveyed the premises. The sulphur-like pollen of the pitch pine soon covered the pond and the stones and rotten wood along the shore, so that you could have collected a barrelful. This is the 'sulphur showers' we hear of. Even in Calidas' drama of Sacontala, we read of 'rills dyed yellow with the golden dust of the lotus.' And so the seasons went rolling on into summer, as one rambles into higher and higher grass. Thus was my first year's life in the woods completed; and the second ", "Tropical rainforests are dense and warm rainforests with high rainfall typically found between 10\u00b0 north and south of the Equator. They are a subset of the tropical forest biome that occurs roughly within the 28\u00b0 latitudes (in the torrid zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn). Tropical rainforests are a type of tropical moist broadleaf forest, that includes the more extensive seasonal tropical forests. True rainforests usually occur in tropical rainforest climates where no dry season occurs; all months have an average precipitation of at least 60 mm (2.4 in). Seasonal tropical forests with tropical monsoon or savanna climates are sometimes included in the broader definition. ", "Tropical rainforests have existed on earth for hundreds of millions of years. Most tropical rainforests today are on fragments of the Mesozoic era supercontinent of Gondwana. The separation of the landmass resulted in a great loss of amphibian diversity while at the same time the drier climate spurred the diversification of reptiles. The division left tropical rainforests located in five major regions of the world: tropical America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and New Guinea, with smaller outliers in Australia. However, the specifics of the origin of rainforests remain uncertain due to an incomplete fossil record. Other types of tropical forest Main article: Tropical forest Several biomes may appear similar-to, or merge via ecotones with, tropical rainforest: Hawaiian tropical rainforest seen from the Hana Highway Moist seasonal tropical forest Daintree rainforest in Queensland is a seasonal tropical forest. Moist seasonal tropical forests receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. These forests usually fall under tropical monsoon or tropical savanna climates. Some trees in these forests drop some or all of their leaves during the winter dry season, thus they are sometimes called 'tropical mixed forest'. They are found in parts of South America, in Central America and around the Caribbean, in coastal West Africa, parts of the Indian subcontinent, and across much of Indochina. Montane rainforests These are found in cooler-climate mountainous areas, becoming known as cloud forests at higher elevations. Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between 1500 and 2500 m while the upper limit is usually from 2400 to 3300 m. Flooded rainforests Tropical freshwater swamp forests, or 'flooded forests', are found in Amazon basin (the V\u00e1rzea) and elsewhere. Forest structure ", "Tropical rainforests are located around and near the equator, therefore having what is called an equatorial climate characterized by three major climatic parameters: temperature, rainfall, and dry season intensity. Other parameters that affect tropical rainforests are carbon dioxide concentrations, solar radiation, and nitrogen availability. In general, climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. However, the abundance of rainfall changes throughout the year creating distinct moist and dry seasons. Tropical forests are classified by the amount of rainfall received each year, which has allowed ecologists to define differences in these forests that look so similar in structure. According to Holdridge's classification of tropical ecosystems, true tropical rainforests have an annual rainfall greater than 2 m and annual temperature greater than 24 degrees Celsius, with a potential evapotranspiration ratio (PET) value of <0.25. However, most lowland tropical forests can be classified as tropical moist or wet forests, which differ in regards to rainfall. Tropical forest ecology- dynamics, composition, and function- are sensitive to changes in climate especially changes in rainfall. ", "Tropical rainforests exhibit a vast diversity in plant and animal species. The root for this remarkable speciation has been a query of scientists and ecologists for years. A number of theories have been developed for why and how the tropics can be so diverse. Interspecific competition Interspecific competition results from a high density of species with similar niches in the tropics and limited resources available. Species which 'lose' the competition may either become extinct or find a new niche. Direct competition will often lead to one species dominating another by some advantage, ultimately driving it to extinction. Niche partitioning is the other option for a species. This is the separation and rationing of necessary resources by utilizing different habitats, food sources, cover or general behavioral differences. A species with similar food items but different feeding times is an example of niche partitioning. Pleistocene refugia ", "Tropical rainforests have harboured human life for many millennia, with many Indigenous people in South and Central America, who belong to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the Congo Pygmies in Central Africa, and several tribes in Southeast Asia, like the Dayak people and the Penan people in Borneo. Food resources within the forest are extremely dispersed due to the high biological diversity and what food does exist is largely restricted to the canopy and requires considerable energy to obtain. Some groups of hunter-gatherers have exploited rainforest on a seasonal basis but dwelt primarily in adjacent savanna and open forest environments where food is much more abundant. Other people described as rainforest dwellers are hunter-gatherers who subsist in large part by trading high value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forest. Indigenous peoples Main article: Indigenous peoples ", "raising Guinea FowlMany people have never seen or even heard of guinea fowl, and they often mistake it for some kind of turkey. But nope, they are not! Guineas are Galliformes, a group including all chicken-like birds, but have their own kind of bird family. There are many kinds of guinea fowl, with the Pearl (or Helmeted Pearl) guineas being the most known and domesticated. Other favorite varieties include the White, Royal Purple, and Lavender guinea fowl. Pearl feathers are often used for decorative purposes. ", "Guinea fowl eggsGuinea fowl only lay eggs between March - October, depending on your location. Hens will lay on average around 100 eggs per season.Their eggs are light brown, speckled, smaller than chicken eggs, and very hard-shelled. As I mentioned earlier, guineas will lay their eggs anywhere they deem fit! And often in the places where you will never find it! It could be in the woods, long grass, or on top of buildings. This is their way to hide the eggs from predators.Guineas are 'communal' layers where they will often all lay in one nest until there are sufficient eggs. Sometimes up to 50! They are also communal brooders, taking turns to sit on the nest. How precious is that, mothers helping each other!Since guineas will lay their eggs anywhere, you may struggle if you plan on collecting eggs. Your best bet is to purchase keets (baby guineas) or young hens and keep them in an enclosed space from a young age. This will familiarize them with the coop, and once they get older, you can gradually start to free-range them one by one.They will stay close to the pen where their family is (they are pack animals, so they won\u2019t stray far) and learn to return to the coop each night.Yes, it is a lot of work and will take a lot of patience, but this is your best tactic from possibly losing them all to the woods. As I said, they are wanderers! Oh, and they can fly pretty high! ", "RAISING guinea KEETSYou can order guinea keets the same way you would order chicken chicks and often from the same hatcheries.The chicks will start off in a 95-degree brooder. Then approximately every three days, you'll turn down the temperature by five degrees. If you've raised chicks before, you'll know the signs of discomfort. They will huddle under the lamp if it's too cold or try to stay as far away if it's too hot.Keets need much more protein than baby chicks. You should start them on a 28 % game-bird/turkey ration (they prefer crumbles) and then change to an 18 % feed for weeks 5 - 8. After week 8, you will continue with a 16 % layer mash.Only give them lukewarm water as cold water can cause a life-threatening chill. You should also keep their bedding clean and dry.Move the keets to a pen once they're fully feathered, but don't let them out to join the flock yet. They need to stay there for two to four weeks.You can read more here on how to care for baby chicks, and much of the same will apply to keets: Baby Chicks 101 "], "All URLs": ["https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-eng-102-college-writing-ii/chapter/walden-by-henry-david-thoreau/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest", "https://www.azurefarmlife.com/farm-blog/a-beginners-guide-to-guinea-fowl", "https://www.azurefarmlife.com/farm-blog/a-beginners-guide-to-guinea-fowl", "https://www.azurefarmlife.com/farm-blog/a-beginners-guide-to-guinea-fowl"], "All Sources (cited)": [], "Used Sources (cited)": [], "Question": "Explain to a third-grader: true or false guinea only has one season the dry season", "Snippet Output (cited)": [], "Quoted Output (cited)": "Insufficient information to generate a grounded response.", "Paraphrased Output (cited)": "", "Entailed Output (cited)": "", "Abstractive Output (cited)": "", "Snippet Output": [], "Quoted Output": "Insufficient information to generate a grounded response.", "Paraphrased Output": "", "Entailed Output": "", "Abstractive Output": "", "Quoted Sent (cited)": [], "Paraphrased Sent (cited)": [], "Entailed Sent (cited)": [], "Abstractive Sent (cited)": [], "Quoted Sent": [], "Paraphrased Sent": [], "Entailed Sent": [], "Abstractive Sent": [], "Quoted Citation Dict": {}, "Paraphrased Citation Dict": {}, "Entailed Citation Dict": {}, "Abstractive Citation Dict": {}, "Quoted Citation Count": 0, "Paraphrased Citation Count": 0, "Entailed Citation Count": 0, "Abstractive Citation Count": 0, "Snippet Fluency Rating": null, "Snippet Perceived Utility Rating": null, "Snippet n-gram precision": null, "Quoted Fluency Rating": null, "Quoted Perceived Utility Rating": null, "Quoted n-gram precision": null, "Paraphrased Fluency Rating": null, "Paraphrased Perceived Utility Rating": null, "Paraphrased n-gram precision": null, "Entailed Fluency Rating": null, "Entailed Perceived Utility Rating": null, "Entailed n-gram precision": null, "Abstractive Fluency Rating": null, "Abstractive Perceived Utility Rating": null, "Abstractive n-gram precision": null, "Chunks": 10, "Max Tokens": 512, "Temperature": 0.2, "Quoted inference_run_count": -1, "Quoted inference_token_input_count": -1, "Quoted inference_token_output_count": -1, "Paraphrased inference_run_count": -1, "Paraphrased inference_token_input_count": -1, "Paraphrased inference_token_output_count": -1, "Entailed inference_run_count": -1, "Entailed inference_token_input_count": -1, "Entailed inference_token_output_count": -1, "Abstractive inference_run_count": -1, "Abstractive inference_token_input_count": -1, "Abstractive inference_token_output_count": -1}
{"ID": 443, "All Sources": ["A Christmas card is a greeting card sent as part of the traditional celebration of Christmas in order to convey between people a range of sentiments related to Christmastide and the holiday season. Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including some non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads 'wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year'. There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer, Christmas song lyrics or Biblical verse; others focus on the general holiday season with an all-inclusive 'Season's greetings'. The first modern Christmas card was by John Calcott Horsley. A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves. History The world's first commercially produced Christmas card, designed by John Callcott Horsley for Henry Cole in 1843 Children looking at Christmas cards in New York 1910 Christmas card by Louis Prang, showing a group of anthropomorphized frogs parading with banner and band. The first known Christmas card was sent by Michael Maier to James I of England and his son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1611. It was discovered in 1979 by Adam McLean in the Scottish Record Office. It was hand-made and incorporated Rosicrucian imagery, with the words of the greeting \u2013 'A greeting on the birthday of the Sacred King, to the most worshipful and energetic lord and most eminent James, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Defender of the true faith, with a gesture of joyful celebration of the Birthday of the Lord, in most joyand fortune, we enter into the new auspicious year 1612' \u2013 being laid out to form a rose. The first commercially available card was commissioned by Sir Henry Cole and designed by John Callcott Horsley in London 1843. The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor. Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each. Early British cards rarely showed winter or religious themes, instead favoring flowers, fairies and other fanciful designs that reminded the recipient of the approach of spring. Humorous and sentimental images of children and animals were popular, as were increasingly elaborate shapes, decorations and materials. At Christmas 1873, the lithograph firm Prang and Mayer began creating greeting cards for the popular market in Britain. The firm began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874, thus becoming the first printer to offer cards in America. Its owner, Louis Prang, is sometimes called the 'father of the American Christmas card.' By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the chromolithography process of printmaking. However, the popularity of his cards led to cheap imitations that eventually drove him from the market. The advent of the postcard spelled the end for elaborate Victorian-style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day, including Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card. The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand Hallmark Cards was established in 1913 by Joyce Hall with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards. The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of World War I increased demand for cards to send to soldiers. The World Wars brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic 'studio cards' with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of Victorian and Edwardian cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004. Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters \u2013 especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone. Some card manufacturers now provide E-cards. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period. In mostly non-religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are called New Year Cards; they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols. Official Christmas cards President Johnson's 1967 White House Christmas card 'Official' Christmas cards began with Queen Victoria in the 1840s.

Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including some non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads 'wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year'.

The first modern Christmas card was by John Calcott Horsley. A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves.

The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor. Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each.

By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the chromolithography process of printmaking.

President Herbert Hoover was the first to give Christmas notes to the White House staff, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to utilize the card format (rather than the previously used notes or a written statement) that most closely resembles the Christmas cards of today. In 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first official White House card. The cards usually depict White House scenes as rendered by prominent American artists. The number of recipients has snowballed over the decades, from just 2,000 in 1961 to 1.4 million in 2005. Commercial Christmas cards Tucker Corporation Christmas Card, 1947 Many businesses, from small local businesses to multi-national enterprises, send Christmas cards to the people on their customer lists, as a way to develop general goodwill, retain brand awareness and reinforce social networks. These cards are almost always discrete and secular in design, and do not attempt to sell a product, limiting themselves to mentioning the name of the business. The practice harkens back to trade cards of the 18th century, an ancestor of the modern Christmas card. In September 1964, it was reported that, during the previous eight years, British industry had increasingly stopped sending 'official' christmas cards, including Granada, ICI, Schweppes, Shell and Unilver.

{"ID": 254, "All Sources": ["The results of the 2022 team event were fraught with controversy. The medal ceremony originally scheduled for 8 February was delayed over what International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required 'legal consultation' with the International Skating Union. Several media outlets reported that the issue was over a positive test from December 2021 that showed the presence of trimetazidine in a sample given by Kamila Valieva from the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), which was officially confirmed on 11 February. The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), under suspension from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2015 for its years of serving solely to hide the positive doping results of Russian athletes, cleared Valieva on 9 February, a day after the December test results were released and two months after the test. The IOC, WADA, and the ISU appealed the RUSADA's decision. On 29 January 2024, the CAS disqualified Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation which they found her to have committed. On 30 January 2024, the ISU, among other actions, re-allocated the medals in the figure skating team event, upgrading the United States and Japan to gold and silver, while downgrading the ROC to bronze. By 25 July 2024, the CAS dismissed all of Russia's appeals of their January decision, and on 7 August 2024, the American and Japanese teams were presented with their gold and silver medals at a ceremony held at the Champions Park, near the Eiffel Tower, during the 2024 Summer Olympics.

BrennerDesign date1909 (modified since)ReverseDesignUnion ShieldDesignerLyndall BassDesign date2010\u2013present The cent, the United States of America one-cent coin (symbol: \u00a2), often called the 'penny', is a unit of currency equaling one-hundredth of a United States of America dollar. It has been the lowest face-value physical unit of U.S. currency since the abolition of the half-cent in 1857 (the abstract mill, which has never been minted, equal to a tenth of a cent, continues to see limited use in the fields of taxation and finance). The first U.S. cent was produced in 1787, and the cent has been issued primarily as a copper or copper-plated coin throughout its history. Due to inflation, pennies have lost virtually all their purchasing power and are often viewed as an expensive burden to businesses, banks, government (especially mints) and the public in general. The penny is issued in its current form as the Lincoln cent, with its obverse featuring the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909, the centennial of his birth. From 1959 (the sesquicentennial of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial. Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln's 200th birthday and a new, 'permanent' reverse \u2013 the Union Shield \u2013 was introduced in 2010. The coin is 0.75 inches (19.05 mm) in diameter and 0.0598 inches (1.52 mm) in thickness. The current copper-plated zinc cent issued since 1982 weighs 2.5 grams, while the previous 95% copper cent still found in circulation weighed 3.11 g (see further below). In 1943, at the peak of World War II, zinc-coated steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper. A few copper cents from 1943 were produced from 1942 planchets remaining in the bins. Similarly, some 1944 steel cents have been confirmed. From 1944 to 1946, salvaged ammunition shells made their way into the minting process, and it was not uncommon to see coins featuring streaks of brass or having a considerably darker finish than other issues. During the early 1970s, the price of copper rose to the point where the cent contained almost one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternative metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and over 1.5 million samples of the 1974 aluminum cent were struck before ultimately being rejected. The cent's composition was changed in 1982 because the value of the copper in the coin started to rise above one cent. Some 1982 cents used the 97.5% zinc composition, while others used the 95% copper composition. With the exception of 2009 bicentennial cents minted specifically for collectors, United States cents minted after 1982 have been zinc with copper plating. The bronze and copper cents can be distinguished from the newer zinc cents by dropping the coins on a solid surface, or by flipping them in the air with your thumb. The predominantly zinc coins make a lower-pitched 'clunk' when hitting the surface, and make no sound when flipped in the air; while the copper coins produce a higher-pitched ringing sound. In addition, a full 50-cent roll of pre-1982/3 coins weighs 5.4 oz (150 g) compared to a post-1982\u201383 roll which weighs 4.4 oz (120 g). Designs The Lincoln cent is the current one-cent coin of the U.S. It was adopted in 1909 (which would have been Lincoln's 100th birthday), replacing the Indian Head cent. Its reverse was changed in 1959 from a wheat-stalks design to a design which includes the Lincoln Memorial (to commemorate Lincoln's sesquicentennial) and was replaced again in 2009 with four new designs to commemorate Lincoln's bicentennial. There are more one-cent coins produced than any other denomination, which makes the Lincoln cent a familiar item. In its lifespan, this coin has weathered both world wars, one of which temporarily changed its composition as part of the war effort. The obverse design is the longest produced for any circulating American coin. History A collection of Lincoln cents from 1941 to 1974. Nearly complete set in a folder. Also features two error coins.

The drawings are from An Essay on Coinage by Samuel Thompson. Although published in Ireland in 1783, the drawings show methods and machinery similar to those at the Mint. Screw presses fitted with a lower and upper die stamped the coin designs. They were operated by one to three men, depending on the size of the press. Smaller screw presses operated by one man were also used as cutting presses. In March of 1793 the Mint delivered its first circulating coins: 11,178 copper cents. Silver coin production started the following year and gold coinage began in 1795. Coining was slow; it\u2019s possible that each press could only produce a couple dozen coins per minute. The Mint couldn\u2019t produce the quantities of coins needed for circulation. Congress allowed certain foreign coins, in circulation since the colonial days, to continue as legal tender. The Switch to Steam Power ", "Copper coins, such as the penny, started as pure copper, but rising copper prices led to changes in composition. In 1857, the Mint added nickel to the copper, but switched to tin and zinc in 1864. For the year 1943, pennies became zinc-coated steel because copper was essential to the war effort during World War II. But the Mint also struck a limited number of copper pennies. In 1962 tin was eliminated, and in 1982 the penny became primarily zinc with only 2.5% copper. Silver coins (half dime, dime, quarter, half dollar, dollar) originally consisted of a fineness of .8924, changing to .900 in 1837. In 1866, the new five-cent coin became the first to eliminate silver with a new composition of copper and nickel. It gained the name 'nickel' from its composition. In 1965, the dime and quarter followed, and in 1971, none of the circulating coins contained silver. ", "Most of our coins are metal sandwiches. The outside layers are three-quarters copper and one-quarter nickel, and the 'filling' is solid copper. Pennies are made of zinc coated with copper. Only nickels are one solid material\u2014that same 75% copper/25% nickel alloy. Would you like fries with that? This penny is almost as big as a half dollar... America's first one-cent piece, called the 'large cent,' was first struck in 1793, one year after the Mint opened. It was so big that it was hard to use, but it wasn't replaced by a smaller penny until 1857, more than 50 years later. George Washington was our first President \u2013 but not the first President on a circulating coin.... In 1909, President Lincoln appeared on a one-cent coin and became the first real person\u2014as well as the first American president\u2014to have his face appear on a regular-issue American coin. We used to trade gold, silver, and copper.... A 1792 law directed American money to be made of gold, silver and copper. Gold was used in the $10, $5, and $2.50 pieces. The dollar, half dollar, quarter, dime, and half dime were composed of silver. The cent and half cent were made of copper. How much was in that first batch?... The Mint produced its first circulating coins\u2014all $111.78 worth of them\u2014in March 1793. That first batch consisted of 11,178 copper cents. Soon after, the Mint began issuing gold and silver coins as well. Which Revolutionary War hero also helped make coins?... Besides being quite the skilled horseman and informant, Paul Revere was a silversmith and a contributor to our nation's coinage. Revere's metals company once supplied the Mint with rolled copper for the production of early cents. Heads, it\u2019s Lincoln; tails, it\u2019s Lincoln....

The drawings are from An Essay on Coinage by Samuel Thompson. Although published in Ireland in 1783, the drawings show methods and machinery similar to those at the Mint. Screw presses fitted with a lower and upper die stamped the coin designs. They were operated by one to three men, depending on the size of the press. Smaller screw presses operated by one man were also used as cutting presses. In March of 1793 the Mint delivered its first circulating coins: 11,178 copper cents. Silver coin production started the following year and gold coinage began in 1795. Coining was slow; it\u2019s possible that each press could only produce a couple dozen coins per minute. The Mint couldn\u2019t produce the quantities of coins needed for circulation. Congress allowed certain foreign coins, in circulation since the colonial days, to continue as legal tender. The Switch to Steam Power ", "https://www.usmint.gov/learn/history/historic-coin-production\nCopper coins, such as the penny, started as pure copper, but rising copper prices led to changes in composition. In 1857, the Mint added nickel to the copper, but switched to tin and zinc in 1864. For the year 1943, pennies became zinc-coated steel because copper was essential to the war effort during World War II. But the Mint also struck a limited number of copper pennies. In 1962 tin was eliminated, and in 1982 the penny became primarily zinc with only 2.5% copper. Silver coins (half dime, dime, quarter, half dollar, dollar) originally consisted of a fineness of .8924, changing to .900 in 1837. In 1866, the new five-cent coin became the first to eliminate silver with a new composition of copper and nickel. It gained the name 'nickel' from its composition. In 1965, the dime and quarter followed, and in 1971, none of the circulating coins contained silver. ", "https://www.usmint.gov/learn/kids/coins/fun-facts/category/penny\nMost of our coins are metal sandwiches. The outside layers are three-quarters copper and one-quarter nickel, and the 'filling' is solid copper. Pennies are made of zinc coated with copper. Only nickels are one solid material\u2014that same 75% copper/25% nickel alloy. Would you like fries with that? This penny is almost as big as a half dollar... America's first one-cent piece, called the 'large cent,' was first struck in 1793, one year after the Mint opened. It was so big that it was hard to use, but it wasn't replaced by a smaller penny until 1857, more than 50 years later. George Washington was our first President \u2013 but not the first President on a circulating coin.... In 1909, President Lincoln appeared on a one-cent coin and became the first real person\u2014as well as the first American president\u2014to have his face appear on a regular-issue American coin. We used to trade gold, silver, and copper.... A 1792 law directed American money to be made of gold, silver and copper. Gold was used in the $10, $5, and $2.50 pieces. The dollar, half dollar, quarter, dime, and half dime were composed of silver. The cent and half cent were made of copper. How much was in that first batch?... The Mint produced its first circulating coins\u2014all $111.78 worth of them\u2014in March 1793. That first batch consisted of 11,178 copper cents. Soon after, the Mint began issuing gold and silver coins as well. Which Revolutionary War hero also helped make coins?... Besides being quite the skilled horseman and informant, Paul Revere was a silversmith and a contributor to our nation's coinage. Revere's metals company once supplied the Mint with rolled copper for the production of early cents. Heads, it\u2019s Lincoln; tails, it\u2019s Lincoln....

It has been the lowest face-value physical unit of U.S. currency since the abolition of the half-cent in 1857 (the abstract mill, which has never been minted, equal to a tenth of a cent, continues to see limited use in the fields of taxation and finance). The first U.S. cent was produced in 1787, and the cent has been issued primarily as a copper or copper-plated coin throughout its history. Due to inflation, pennies have lost virtually all their purchasing power and are often viewed as an expensive burden to businesses, banks, government (especially mints) and the public in general. The penny is issued in its current form as the Lincoln cent, with its obverse featuring the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909, the centennial of his birth. From 1959 (the sesquicentennial of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial. Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln's 200th birthday and a new, 'permanent' reverse \u2013 the Union Shield \u2013 was introduced in 2010.

During the early 1970s, the price of copper rose to the point where the cent contained almost one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternative metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and over 1.5 million samples of the 1974 aluminum cent were struck before ultimately being rejected. \u001b[92m[1] The cent's composition was changed in 1982 because the value of the copper in the coin started to rise above one cent\u001b[0m. \u001b[92m[2] Some 1982 cents used the 97.5% zinc composition, while others used the 95% copper composition\u001b[0m.

He was raised in nearby Ferndale, Washington, and attended Ferndale High School, and was an All-State selection in football, basketball, and baseball. His quarterback coach at Ferndale was Ray Ramsay. After high school he graduated from Northeast Louisiana University, where he was quarterback from 1987 through 1990. He still holds multiple passing records at the school. Professional Miami Dolphins Pederson originally signed as a rookie free agent by the Miami Dolphins on May 1, 1991, out of Northeast Louisiana University (now University of Louisiana at Monroe) in Monroe, Louisiana. He was waived on August 17, 1991, before the start of the regular season. After spending the 1991 season as a free agent, the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League of American Football (WLAF) drafted him in the fifth round for the first pool of draft-eligible players on February 4, 1992. The second pool, which was drafted from on February 20, consisted of players allocated by NFL teams to the league. He was the backup quarterback to Reggie Slack with the Knights from March to May 1992. After the WLAF season finished, he was re-signed by the Dolphins on June 2, 1992. Pederson spent 1992 training camp with the Dolphins, before being released during final roster cuts again. He was subsequently re-signed to the team's practice squad, where he practiced on the scout team until he was waived on October 8, 1992. He was re-signed by the Dolphins after the season on March 3, 1993. After his third training camp with the Dolphins, he was waived again on August 31, 1993. For the second consecutive season, Pederson was re-signed to the team's practice squad, on September 1, 1993. Dan Marino, the Dolphins' starting quarterback since 1983, ruptured his Achilles' tendon in a week 6 game against the Cleveland Browns on October 10, 1993, forcing backup Scott Mitchell to replace him. Pederson replaced Marino on the active roster, and served as Mitchell's backup for the next four games. Pederson made his NFL debut on October 24, 1993, in a week 8 game against the Indianapolis Colts. He helped head coach Don Shula win his NFL-record 325th victory as a coach when Mitchell suffered a separated shoulder in a week 11 game against the Philadelphia Eagles on November 14, 1993. In that record breaking game for Coach Shula, Pederson entered in the third quarter of the game and went 3 for 6 for 34 yards while converting several crucial third downs. Pederson was able to steer the Dolphins to the win. Pederson also served as the backup to recently acquired Steve DeBerg for the three games Mitchell missed with injury. He briefly entered a week 14 game against the New York Giants while DeBerg was receiving stitches on his face. Mitchell returned as the Dolphins' starter after week 15, and Pederson was released in favor of backup DeBerg and third-string quarterback Hugh Millen on December 16, 1993. ", "Pederson considered retirement after being released by the Eagles, but instead signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Browns on September 2, 2000.

He was raised in nearby Ferndale, Washington, and attended Ferndale High School, and was an All-State selection in football, basketball, and baseball. His quarterback coach at Ferndale was Ray Ramsay. After high school he graduated from Northeast Louisiana University, where he was quarterback from 1987 through 1990. He still holds multiple passing records at the school. Professional Miami Dolphins Pederson originally signed as a rookie free agent by the Miami Dolphins on May 1, 1991, out of Northeast Louisiana University (now University of Louisiana at Monroe) in Monroe, Louisiana. He was waived on August 17, 1991, before the start of the regular season. After spending the 1991 season as a free agent, the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League of American Football (WLAF) drafted him in the fifth round for the first pool of draft-eligible players on February 4, 1992. The second pool, which was drafted from on February 20, consisted of players allocated by NFL teams to the league. He was the backup quarterback to Reggie Slack with the Knights from March to May 1992. After the WLAF season finished, he was re-signed by the Dolphins on June 2, 1992. Pederson spent 1992 training camp with the Dolphins, before being released during final roster cuts again. He was subsequently re-signed to the team's practice squad, where he practiced on the scout team until he was waived on October 8, 1992. He was re-signed by the Dolphins after the season on March 3, 1993. After his third training camp with the Dolphins, he was waived again on August 31, 1993. For the second consecutive season, Pederson was re-signed to the team's practice squad, on September 1, 1993. Dan Marino, the Dolphins' starting quarterback since 1983, ruptured his Achilles' tendon in a week 6 game against the Cleveland Browns on October 10, 1993, forcing backup Scott Mitchell to replace him. Pederson replaced Marino on the active roster, and served as Mitchell's backup for the next four games. Pederson made his NFL debut on October 24, 1993, in a week 8 game against the Indianapolis Colts. He helped head coach Don Shula win his NFL-record 325th victory as a coach when Mitchell suffered a separated shoulder in a week 11 game against the Philadelphia Eagles on November 14, 1993. In that record breaking game for Coach Shula, Pederson entered in the third quarter of the game and went 3 for 6 for 34 yards while converting several crucial third downs. Pederson was able to steer the Dolphins to the win. Pederson also served as the backup to recently acquired Steve DeBerg for the three games Mitchell missed with injury. He briefly entered a week 14 game against the New York Giants while DeBerg was receiving stitches on his face. Mitchell returned as the Dolphins' starter after week 15, and Pederson was released in favor of backup DeBerg and third-string quarterback Hugh Millen on December 16, 1993.

That powerful legal voice must address big challenges to the rule of law including preservation of the Bill of Rights, access to justice, equal justice, global migration, human trafficking, and a growing erosion of confidence in democratic institutions. Why Does Law Lack A Forceful Voice? Law has many voices. Most speak for discrete segments of the legal population, focusing on issues that most affect their constituents.

Legal service providers and consumers, likewise, tend not to focus on broader issues, though the latter dictates by whom and how legal services are delivered.

All legislative power in the government is vested in Congress, meaning that it is the only part of the government that can make new laws or change existing laws. Executive Branch agencies issue regulations with the full force of law, but these are only under the authority of laws enacted by Congress. The President may veto bills Congress passes, but Congress may also override a veto by a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Article I of the Constitution enumerates the powers of Congress and the specific areas in which it may legislate. Congress is also empowered to enact laws deemed 'necessary and proper' for the execution of the powers given to any part of the government under the Constitution. Part of Congress\u2019s exercise of legislative authority is the establishment of an annual budget for the government. To this end, Congress levies taxes and tariffs to provide funding for essential government services. If enough money cannot be raised to fund the government, then Congress may also authorize borrowing to make up the difference. Congress can also mandate spending on specific items: legislatively directed spending, commonly known as 'earmarks,' specifies funds for a particular project, rather than for a government agency. Both chambers of Congress have extensive investigative powers, and may compel the production of evidence or testimony toward whatever end they deem necessary. Members of Congress spend much of their time holding hearings and investigations in committee. Refusal to cooperate with a congressional subpoena can result in charges of contempt of Congress, which could result in a prison term.

It is located at the bottom of the brain immediately inferior to the hypothalamus. The optic chiasm is found in all vertebrates, although in cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes), it is located within the brain. This article is about the optic chiasm of vertebrates, which is the best known nerve chiasm, but not every chiasm denotes a crossing of the body midline (e.g., in some invertebrates, see Chiasm (anatomy)). A midline crossing of nerves inside the brain is called a decussation (see Definition of types of crossings).

In many vertebrates the left optic nerve crosses over the right one without fusing with it. In vertebrates with a large overlap of the visual fields of the two eyes, i.e., most mammals and birds, but also amphibians, reptiles such as chameleons, the two optic nerves merge in the optic chiasm. In such a merged optic chiasm, part of the nerve fibres do not cross the midline, but continue towards the optic tract of the ipsilateral side. By this partial decussation, the part of the visual field that is covered by both eyes is fused so that the processing of binocular depth perception by stereopsis is enabled (see Figure 2). ", "Beyond the optic chiasm, with crossed and uncrossed fibers, the optic nerves are called optic tracts. The optic tract inserts on the optic tectum (in mammals known as superior colliculus) of the midbrain. In mammals they also branch off to the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus, in turn giving them to the occipital cortex of the cerebrum. Arterial supply The optic chiasma receives its arterial supply from the anterior cerebral arteries, and from branches of the internal carotid artery which ascend along the pituitary stalk (the latter supplying the midline portion of the chiasma). Development in mammals ", "Thus, a trochlear nerve palsy causes an ipsilateral higher eye (i.e., hypertropia) and excyclotorsion (the affected eye deviates upward and rotates outward). Patients may report vertical and/or torsional diplopia that is usually worse on downgaze and gaze away from the affected side. Anatomy There are several clinically significant features of the trochlear nerve anatomy. It is the thinnest, and longest cranial nerve. Additionally, the fourth cranial nerve exits dorsally, crosses the midline, and innervates the contralateral SOM.

At the level of the pons, the cerebral aqueduct has expanded to form the fourth ventricle (Figure 1.12). The cerebellum is situated posterior to the pons and forms part of the roof (tectum) of the forth ventricle. The pons contains nuclei that receive axons from various cortical areas. Projections from the axons of these pontine neurons form large transverse fiber bundles that traverse the pons and ascend to the contralateral cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncles. Also, within the pons base and tegmentum are longitudinally ascending and descending fibers.

The spinal cord neuron (gray matter) form a central core taking a butterfly configuration that is surrounded by nerve fibers (white matter). In the left and right halves of the spinal cord, the gray matter is organized into a dorsal horn and ventral horn with the intermediate gray located between them. In the thoracic spinal cord, which is illustrated in this figure, a lateral horn extends laterally from the intermediate gray (Figure 1.17A). The spinal cord white matter is subdivided into the posterior white column, the anterior white column and the lateral white column. The anterior white commissure joins the two halves of the spinal cord and is located ventral to the intermediate gray. The dorsal root fibers enter the spinal cord at the dorsolateral sulcus and the fibers of the ventral root fibers exit the spinal cord in numerous fine bundles through the ventral funiculus (see Figure 1.5).

The CHP has primary patrol jurisdiction over all California highways and roads and streets outside city limits, and can exercise law enforcement powers anywhere within the state. The California Highway Patrol can assist local and county agencies and can patrol major city streets along with local and county law enforcement, state and interstate highways, and is the primary law enforcement agency in rural parts of the state. The California State Legislature originally established the California Highway Patrol as a branch of the Division of Motor Vehicles in the Department of Public Works, with legislation signed by Governor C. C. Young on August 14, 1929. It was subsequently established as a separate department with legislation signed by Governor Earl Warren in 1947. The CHP gradually assumed increased responsibility beyond the enforcement of the State Vehicle Act and eventually merged with the smaller California State Police in 1995. It is currently organized as part of the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA). In addition to its highway patrol duties, the CHP also provides other services including protecting state buildings and facilities (most notably the California State Capitol) and guarding state officials. The CHP also works with municipal and federal law enforcement agencies, providing assistance in investigations, patrol and other aspects of law enforcement. The agency is responsible for law enforcement on all California state routes (including all freeways and expressways), U.S. Highways, Interstate Highways and all public roads in unincorporated and incorporated portions of any specific county. Local police or the local sheriff's department having a contract with an incorporated city are primarily responsible for investigating and enforcing traffic laws in incorporated cities, but any peace officer of the CHP can still enforce any state law anywhere within the state, even though the agency's primary mission is related to transportation. Furthermore, CHP officers act as bailiffs for the California Supreme Court and the six California Courts of Appeal, and also provide security at buildings occupied by the State of California. The Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle replaced the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor in 2013. ", "The California Highway Patrol's additional responsibilities includes a governor protection detail. Somewhat controversially, the cities of Oakland and Stockton have contracted with the California Highway Patrol to assist their police departments with local patrol duties, including traffic stops and responding to 911 calls. Pay and pensions Average officer pay was $118,000 in 2014. By law, salaries are set by an average of the five largest police departments in the state. In 2012, the top paid CHP officer received $483,581, 44 other officers earning over $200,000, and over 5,000 officers receiving over $100,000. In 2011, CHP officers earned $82.4 million in overtime, triple the amount in the second largest state, and with one officer earning over $93,000 in overtime alone. Officers are strictly prohibited from working more than 16.5 hours at a time before having to take a minimum 8-hour break. ", "CHP uniforms are traditionally khaki-colored with campaign hat and blue-and-gold trouser stripe. Command officers wear a tan combination cap. The dress uniform includes a forest green jacket and royal blue tie (bow tie for motor officers). Cold weather and utility uniforms are dark blue.California Highway Patrol campaign hat Leather gear is black basketweave leather with brass snaps and buckles. Standard traffic enforcement patrol vehicles are required by state law to have a white door with, in the case of the CHP, a star. The CHP operates traditional black and white as well as all-white patrol vehicles. The California Highway Patrol is one of the few organizations to continue to use the older toll-free 'Zenith 1-2000' number. With the falling cost of telephone area code 800 and 888 numbers, most organizations have chosen to switch to one of the newer numbers and discontinue use of the Zenith service, which requires operator assistance. The CHP's traditions include its own radio codes, widely adopted by local agencies. The most important is 11\u201199, which signifies that an officer needs emergency assistance or that an officer is down. ", "The 'Mexico Liaison Unit' is a Border Division Unit based in San Diego. Since the CHP has no jurisdiction directly in Mexico, officers from the Unit work closely with Mexican authorities to recover stolen vehicles and assist with other law enforcement issues. The purpose of the 'Mexico Liaison Unit' is to develop and maintain positive working relations with Mexican authorities in order to: Locate and identify stolen U.S. vehicles taken to Mexico Identify vehicle thieves and ensure their prosecution, either in Mexico or California Provide assistance to Mexican and U.S. authorities The unit was originally established in 1958 and only consisted of one officer. It was discontinued in the 1970s, and reestablished in 1980. The unit now consists of one sergeant and six officers, all of whom are fluent in Spanish. Newhall Incident Further information: Newhall incident ", "A follow-up investigation eventually led to a complete revision of procedures during high-risk and felony stops. Firearms procedures have also changed fundamentally due to this incident, and physical methods of arrest have been improved. The police baton and pepper spray have been added to the officer's arsenal, with more in\u2011depth training in their use. The 25th anniversary of the Newhall Incident was observed on April 6, 1995, at the present Newhall Area office, where a brick memorial pays tribute to Officers George Alleyn (6290), Walt Frago (6520), Roger Gore (6547) and James Pence (6885). The memorial once stood at the former Newhall office, but was rebuilt at the new site, about one mile (1.6 km) from the scene of the slayings. History of the former California State Police and its Merger with the California Highway Patrol On July 12, 1995, the California State Police, which was a separate agency, was merged into the CHP, thus greatly expanding the agency's mandate. In addition to safety on the state highway system, it is now responsible for the safety of all elected state officials and all people who work in or are utilizing a state building in California, such as the State Capitol Building in Sacramento. It has also been discussed to merge the Law Enforcement Division of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife into the California Highway Patrol. By doing so, this may allow for better protection of California's environment and natural resources. The underfunded CDFW Law Enforcement Division has faced low numbers of Game Wardens also known as Wildlife Officers for the last ten years; a similar idea is already in place in Oregon and Alaska, where the Oregon State Police and Alaska State Troopers serve as game wardens under a separate fish and wildlife division within the two departments.

It is about a boy who buys and trains two Redbone Coonhounds for hunting. The book is a work of autobiographical fiction based on Rawls' own childhood in the Ozarks. My friend Eileen, the dog trainer, currently lives in Minnesota but we met when she lived in Florida. I suspect it\u2019s cold in Minnesota during the winter like the Ozarks. I called New Year's Day to brag about a new kayak my boyfriend and I had gotten at Christmas because I had met Eileen while volunteering at a sailing non-profit for the disabled and we both loved the water, but I did not get an answer. 'Where the Red Fern Grows' is a coming-of-age story which deals with the classic theme of maturity as Billy learns to work hard, be a leader, and be self-reliant. Because the setting is in the Ozarks, man's relationship to nature is part of the ongoing narrative. A lesson often repeated in the book is that hard work pays off. This can be illustrated by how Billy saved up and purchased the two Redbone Coonhounds dogs, and then trained them. Throughout the story, we see how love, and not just loyalty, enables the trio to persist and overcome. I was not surprised that Eileen trained dogs after working with her at Sailability, the non-profit. She was such a dedicated and patient soul. I was even more impressed when she took in a puppy to train to be a service dog.

Where the Red Fern Grows was written by Wilson Rawls. He was born in Oklahoma in 1913. Rawls was raised at a difficult economic time in the United States and especially in Oklahoma. Like many from Oklahoma, when the Great Depression arrived, Wilson Rawls and his family moved to California in hopes of finding work. He received little formal education. He spent much of his life traveling and working odd jobs in construction. Rawls loved to write and was gifted at telling stories. However, he never studied grammar. His writings were filled with misspellings, and he never used punctuation.  Rawls would write wonderful stories with his limited skills and when he was finished, he would put them in trunk. He never wanted anyone to see his work because he was embarrassed. ", "Wilson would begin to rewrite his stories, and as he wrote, Sophie would edit. It took just three weeks for Wilson and Sophie to write the first version of Where the Red Fern Grows. The story was first published in the Saturday Evening Post and later published as the book that would go on to sell over seven million copies and win numerous awards. Like Wilson Rawls, we each have been given gifts and passion. Rawls wanted nothing more than to be a writer. He just needed a little help. We often have dreams to accomplish something that seems just a little out of reach. That is why God has given us one another. God gave each of us gifts, but we are better, and we can accomplish more when we work together. Sometimes we need a little help and sometimes we need to be available to help others.

The number of both new baptisms and members has declined since. Indeed, according to official statistics, as of 2021: About 1 out of 3 (35.2%) children are christened in the Church of Sweden. About 1 out of 4 (23.5%) weddings take place in church. About 2 out of 3 (66.8%) Swedes have Christian burials. The Church of Sweden, by law, is organized in the following manner: It is an Evangelical Lutheran community of faith manifested in parishes and dioceses. The church also has a national organisation. It is an open national church which, working with a democratic organisation and through the ministry of the church, covers the whole nation. The primate of the Church of Sweden is the Archbishop of Uppsala. Other Protestant denominations The 19th century saw the arrival of various evangelical free churches, and, towards the end of the century secularism, leading many to distance themselves from church rituals. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called Dissenter Act of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another denomination. The right to not belong to any religious denomination was established in the law on freedom of religion in 1951.

{"ID": 451, "All Sources": ["Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) was a subject and core class taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[16][27] in which students studied and learnt how to defend themselves against all aspects of the Dark Arts, including dark creatures,[24][28][29] curses, hexes and jinxes (dark charms),[25] and duelling.[23] The position of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at the school was once rumoured to be jinxed, as no teacher could hold the post for more than a year without suffering an unpleasant fate. Tom Riddle jinxed the position because Albus Dumbledore did not give him the job when he applied for it.[4] The fact that no teacher has lasted longer than a year meant that the subject had numerous Professors over the years.[23] Ilvermorny began teaching the subject in the 17th century.[16] Harry Potter would occasionally deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts in his adulthood.[30] Contents ", "Defence Against the Dark Arts was a required subject from first year to fifth year.[27][21] In this class, students learned how to cast offencive and protective spells, as well as how to properly handle and deal with dark creatures. The lessons generally had a practical approach, with competent teachers like Remus Lupin correctly believing that when it came to the Dark Arts, a practical approach was the best way,[24][25][23] with theoretical assignments given as homework.[31] Inadequate teachers, such as Quirinus Quirrell and Dolores Umbridge, who were focused on theories alone, hampered the learning of defences, as they would not be providing students any practical experiences.[21][32] ", "Also, due to the course being directly related to the Dark Arts itself, Dark wizards who wished to teach would typically apply for this course, notable examples being Tom Riddle,[4] Patricia Rakepick,[40] Quirinus Quirrell,[41] Bartemius Crouch Junior,[10] Dolores Umbridge,[42] Severus Snape[12] and Amycus Carrow.[43] Jinx on the post[] The curriculum of the class varied greatly depending on what the professor at the time deemed appropriate. Due to the jinx on the teaching post that was present before Lord Voldemort died, many teachers had been appointed to this post, with none of them lasting for more than a single school year.[4] Tom Riddle twice applied for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position, the first time shortly after graduation from Hogwarts when he was turned down by Headmaster Armando Dippet, who claimed he was too young, but invited him to re-apply a few years later.[4] Earlier teachers from the 1985\u20131986 school year for example, were considered highly incompetent and ineffective by most students, and as such, very rarely showed up to teach.[44][45][46][47] Patricia Rakepick teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts to fifth-years During the 1988\u20131989 school year, the renowned Curse-Breaker Patricia Rakepick was appointed as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for that academic year.[5] She proved herself to be a highly effective teacher of both defensive and offensive magic, having taught her students a wide variety of fascinating and useful topics during her lessons, to compensate her students for having learnt almost nothing in previous years. She even gave her select students private lessons in the subject, teaching them how to duel, in preparation for locating the Cursed Vaults throughout the Castle.[5][48][49][50][51][52] [53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] Bill Weasley teaching a group of students DADA in the evening ", "During the 1995\u20131996 school year, the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, had deluded himself with the bizarre conspiracy theory that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore was using the students to create a private army of young witches and wizards to overthrow the Ministry.[73] As such, he implanted Dolores Umbridge to become the teacher of the Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, which he believed to be the main source of training (e.g. defensive spells) for Dumbledore's would-be soldiers.[21] Umbridge 'teaching' Defence Against the Dark Arts ", "When J. K. Rowling was asked why Dumbledore would not give Severus Snape the Defence Against the Dark Arts job, Rowling responded that Dumbledore believed that teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts would bring out Snape's worst side,[117] though Dumbledore finally relented in Harry's sixth year.[118] Snape feigned ignorance when questioned by Hogwarts High Inquisitor Umbridge about Dumbledore's reason for denying him the post,[119] but admitted it to Bellatrix Lestrange during their conversation in Spinner's End.[120] Rowling has also revealed that after Amycus Carrow was the Dark Arts teacher, a permanent teacher took the post because Voldemort's jinx over the job was lifted. ", "each meets Harry before he arrives at Hogwarts in the respective year (with the exception of Mad-Eye Moody, who was only mentioned in passing, although Harry had unknowingly encountered Barty Crouch Jnr at the Quidditch World Cup) and each physically (or magically) attacks Harry during school term, either intentionally or accidentally, as in the case of Remus Lupin. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when discussing who their new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher would be, Harry said that the teachers didn't have much luck: 'One sacked, one dead, one lost his memory, and one was locked in a trunk for nine months,' referring to Lupin, Quirrell, Lockhart, and Moody, respectively; this isn't true, however, because Lupin resigned rather than was fired. Also, Crouch Jnr, the de facto teacher for Harry's fourth year, suffered the Dementor's Kiss. Quirinus Quirrell is the only Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher known to have died during the year he gave the subject. ", "Defense Against the Dark Arts is one of the staple classes Hogwarts students attend throughout the Harry Potter series, and its rotating cast of professors makes it extra intriguing \u2014 here's every one of the Harry Potter Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers explained. The Harry Potter franchise has reached its penultimate success as the Wizarding World produces the Fantastic Beasts spinoff and the long-awaited video game Hogwarts Legacy. The class in question, also known as D.A.D.A., taught students to defend themselves against all kinds of dark magic, including curses, jinxes, and hexes. The curses weren't just limited to the classroom: the D.A.D.A. teaching position itself seemed cursed. No D.A.D.A. professor lasted in the role for longer than a year during Harry's time at Hogwarts. ", "The final contestant on the Harry Potter Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers roster is Amycus Carrow. Amycus Carrow would have been Harry's seventh-year D.A.D.A. teacher had he attended Hogwarts in his final year. Even though Harry didn't experience Carrow's teaching in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2, many of his school friends still did, including Neville Longbottom. While Carrow was professor, he changed the name of the class from 'Defense Against the Dark Arts' to 'The Dark Arts,' the name reflecting the changed content. He and his sister Alecto were in charge of punishment at the school, so he often incorporated that aspect of his role into his teaching. Students in his class were made to practice the Cruciatus curse on students in detention, and if they refused to do so, as Neville did, they were also tortured. ", "Gilderoy Lockhart In 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' noted celebrity wizard Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) makes his way to Hogwarts on the tails of a never-ending ego trip. Despite the mountains of magical memoirs penned in his name, Lockhart is all but incapable of defensive spells. And yet, no one is more convinced of his greatness than he is himself. This leads to one of the most satisfying scenes in the entire Harry Potter film series: the dueling club demonstration in which Snape absolutely decks Lockhart with a single spell. Quirinus Quirrell In 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone,' professor Quirinus Quirrell (Ian Hart), Harry\u2019s first Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, is unique in that, inadvertently or not, he is also the first teacher to try to kill him. And from what I can recall, the rest of his teaching was unremarkable.

It was written and sung by Tommy Shaw, who also plays the lead guitar solo during the break in the song. It was Shaw's only top 10 single as a writer and vocalist with Styx. Background The inspiration for its lyrics came from Shaw's experiences in a bar in Niles, Michigan, U.S. The lyrics are about an unemployed man who has 'given up hope for the afternoon soaps / and a bottle of cold brew.' Reception Record World said that 'Tommy Shaw's vocal is a perfect vehicle for this message about modern man's boredom and praised the 'brisk beat and winding guitars.' Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia regarded 'Too Much Time on My Hands' as one of Shaw's best singles. Classic Rock critic Malcolm Dome rated it as Styx 6th greatest song, saying that it shows a 'new wave aptitude' linking Styx's 1970s material with 1980s music. Music video PopMatters critic Dennis Shin rated the video as one of '20 \u201980s music videos that have aged terribly,' criticizing its cheesiness, the 'band's period attire,' 'mullets galore, perms, girls with feathered hair, and Joe Dirt in the baby blue jumpsuit on vocals.'

This culminated with the episode on April 29, 2016, when Fallon showed a shot-by-shot reenactment of the video with him and guest Paul Rudd on the show. In this video Fallon plays the part of Dennis DeYoung and Rudd plays Tommy Shaw, with A.D. Miles as James Young, Seth Herzog as John Panozzo, and Gerard Bradford as Chuck Panozzo.

Jimmy Fallon, the host of NBC's uber-popular The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, has been singing the lyrics and jamming along to the song on the show on a regular basis of late, culminating in a shot-by-shot recreation of the song's infamous 1981 video with actor Paul Rudd this past Friday, April 29, which you can view right here. 'It's the best song I've ever heard in my entire life,' Fallon exclaimed about 'Too Much Time' to guest Adam Levine on the previous night of the show \u2014 and who can blame him? (We here at Styxworld have a feeling Jimmy will continue to literally sing the praises of 'Too Much Time on My Hands' in the days and weeks ahead, for numerous reasons...) In case you don't know, the facts are these: 'Too Much Time on My Hands' was written and sung by Tommy Shaw. It was the second single from the band's 1981 triple-platinum chart-topping Paradise Theatre album (or Theater, depending on which part of the album sleeve you're looking at), and it reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles charts. 'Too Much Time' remains a key song in Styx's live set to this very day, most often as the second song the band performs during every show. And now, in a Styxworld exclusive, Tommy Shaw discusses how he wrote 'Too Much Time on My Hands' on his way to the last day of album rehearsals, what specific location the song actually pays homage to, and how the song\u2019s infamous video came to pass. Plus, other members of Styx along with some of the band's peers share their feelings about the song and its enduring legacy. The fun never ends as long as you-know-who is still buying\u2026 Is it any wonder why this song is Fallon's favorite? Mike Mettler: Tommy, the story goes that the inspiration for 'Too Much Time on My Hands' came to you while you were on the way to a rehearsal. Tommy Shaw: Yeah, I remember that part, because it was the last day, and it wound up becoming the most monumental day to me. At that time, I didn\u2019t have my rock song that I needed for the Paradise record. It just wasn\u2019t coming to me. I lived in Michigan, about 60 miles away from where we were rehearsing in Gary, Indiana. Every day, I would drive over there in my black [Oldsmobile] Toranado, this gigantic locomotive that had a built-in CB radio. (both laugh) On that last day, as I got closer to where the exit was, I started to hear this 'dun-dun dun-dun dun-dun-dun-dun.' I heard that in my head. I heard the whole first verse. It was like the whole song was playing in my head. I didn\u2019t have anything to record it on and I was driving, but I was getting near the parking lot as it was all coming to me. ", "I needed to be more succinct and on the beat, but I didn\u2019t have it at first. So I pulled to the side and I said to myself, 'You can play this!' I went back over to Tommy and I said, 'I want to re-audition for that part. I want to replay it.' It\u2019s such a great part, and I almost gave it away. I\u2019ll never do that again. No matter how insecure you are \u2014 try. No matter how frightened you are to play something, if you don\u2019t try it, you\u2019re an idiot. James 'JY' Young (co-founding Styx guitarist/vocalist): 'Too Much Time on My Hands' came a bit late in the game. Maybe too much disco then, which I have nothing against, but it comes out as a rock song now. Mettler: Tommy, what did you base the lyrics on? Where did they come from? ", "Lawrence Gowan (keyboardist/vocalist): I remember hearing 'Too Much Time on My Hands' up in Canada, and it just jumped out of the radio. It hit me immediately. I went looking for it, and I remember looking at that tremendous album cover. I loved the whole concept of it. The cover tied it all together. The dilapidated theater was a great metaphor for America falling apart \u2014 again \u2014 and coming back together, again. And now I\u2019m on the stage with five other guys who are constantly in search of elevating the presentation of every song, especially that one. Todd Sucherman (drummer): 'Too Much Time on My Hands' had a little bit of a stiff, robotic thing to it, and I wanted to give it a little more grease and groove because, ultimately, that\u2019s what makes hips shake, not just metronomic playing. Like I\u2019ve always said, I\u2019m a different human being than John Panozzo was. [Original Styx drummer John Panozzo, Chuck's twin brother, passed away in 1996.] As would any drummer who would be in this band, or any drummer that would replace any drummer in any band, i\u2019s impossible to play it exactly like that other person. It\u2019s one thing to be able to play C, B flat, A \u2014 yeah, OK. With something as organic as drumming, which is as natural as a human heartbeat, it\u2019s going to be a different thing. All I can do is try to make it feel as good as I can. Ricky Phillips (bassist/background vocalist): I was driving and listening to KLOS [99.5 FM, the infamous long-influential FM radio station in Los Angeles] in 1981, and it was a Two for Tuesday. They played 'Too Much Time' and 'Snowblind,' and I remember liking both songs \u2014 a lot. And then going, 'Hmm. I gotta pay more attention to this.' The thing about 'Too Much Time' is that riff that Tommy uses. (Sings the intro guitar riff) \u2014 the riff itself is just so catchy. It\u2019s poppy and it\u2019s rocky at the same time. Maybe it\u2019s a little more poppy, but still, it\u2019s just a cool riff. Guitar players and bass players like it. Everybody gets in a good mood when we play 'Too Much Time.' You can\u2019t help feeling good about it. When you\u2019re playing it, it\u2019s a win-win. That song never does not go over well. It always goes over. Age doesn\u2019t matter. Everybody gets it. Rick Nielsen (lead guitarist of Cheap Trick, 2016 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees): I've known Tommy Shaw a long time. I\u2019ve always loved Tommy. Way-talented man. I think I know some of the other guys too, and they\u2019re not too bad either. What's my favorite Styx song? 'Too Much Time on My Hands.'

(both laugh) On that last day, as I got closer to where the exit was, I started to hear this 'dun-dun dun-dun dun-dun-dun-dun.' I heard that in my head. I heard the whole first verse. It was like the whole song was playing in my head. I didn\u2019t have anything to record it on and I was driving, but I was getting near the parking lot as it was all coming to me. ", "https://styxworld.com/blogs/news/styxworld-exclusive-the-inside-story-behind-too-much-time-on-my-hands\nI needed to be more succinct and on the beat, but I didn\u2019t have it at first. So I pulled to the side and I said to myself, 'You can play this!' I went back over to Tommy and I said, 'I want to re-audition for that part. I want to replay it.' It\u2019s such a great part, and I almost gave it away. I\u2019ll never do that again. No matter how insecure you are \u2014 try. No matter how frightened you are to play something, if you don\u2019t try it, you\u2019re an idiot. James 'JY' Young (co-founding Styx guitarist/vocalist): 'Too Much Time on My Hands' came a bit late in the game. Maybe too much disco then, which I have nothing against, but it comes out as a rock song now. Mettler: Tommy, what did you base the lyrics on? Where did they come from? ", "https://styxworld.com/blogs/news/styxworld-exclusive-the-inside-story-behind-too-much-time-on-my-hands\nLawrence Gowan (keyboardist/vocalist): I remember hearing 'Too Much Time on My Hands' up in Canada, and it just jumped out of the radio. It hit me immediately. I went looking for it, and I remember looking at that tremendous album cover. I loved the whole concept of it. The cover tied it all together. The dilapidated theater was a great metaphor for America falling apart \u2014 again \u2014 and coming back together, again. And now I\u2019m on the stage with five other guys who are constantly in search of elevating the presentation of every song, especially that one. Todd Sucherman (drummer): 'Too Much Time on My Hands' had a little bit of a stiff, robotic thing to it, and I wanted to give it a little more grease and groove because, ultimately, that\u2019s what makes hips shake, not just metronomic playing. Like I\u2019ve always said, I\u2019m a different human being than John Panozzo was. [Original Styx drummer John Panozzo, Chuck's twin brother, passed away in 1996.] As would any drummer who would be in this band, or any drummer that would replace any drummer in any band, i\u2019s impossible to play it exactly like that other person. It\u2019s one thing to be able to play C, B flat, A \u2014 yeah, OK. With something as organic as drumming, which is as natural as a human heartbeat, it\u2019s going to be a different thing. All I can do is try to make it feel as good as I can. Ricky Phillips (bassist/background vocalist): I was driving and listening to KLOS [99.5 FM, the infamous long-influential FM radio station in Los Angeles] in 1981, and it was a Two for Tuesday. They played 'Too Much Time' and 'Snowblind,' and I remember liking both songs \u2014 a lot. And then going, 'Hmm. I gotta pay more attention to this.' The thing about 'Too Much Time' is that riff that Tommy uses. (Sings the intro guitar riff) \u2014 the riff itself is just so catchy. It\u2019s poppy and it\u2019s rocky at the same time. Maybe it\u2019s a little more poppy, but still, it\u2019s just a cool riff. Guitar players and bass players like it. Everybody gets in a good mood when we play 'Too Much Time.' You can\u2019t help feeling good about it. When you\u2019re playing it, it\u2019s a win-win. That song never does not go over well. It always goes over. Age doesn\u2019t matter. Everybody gets it. Rick Nielsen (lead guitarist of Cheap Trick, 2016 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees): I've known Tommy Shaw a long time. I\u2019ve always loved Tommy. Way-talented man. I think I know some of the other guys too, and they\u2019re not too bad either. What's my favorite Styx song? 'Too Much Time on My Hands.'

{"ID": 452, "All Sources": ["Oxygen is a chemical element; it has symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth's crust, and after hydrogen and helium, it is the third-most abundant element in the universe. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2. Diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% of the Earth's atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of oxides. Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant. ", "The present-day distribution of oxygen in the internal deep ocean is thus determined by a complicated and not fully understood interplay of water circulation and bio\u00adlogical productivity, which leads to oxygen consumption in the ocean\u2019s interior. Extensive measurements have shown that the highest oxygen concentrations are found at high latitudes, where the ocean is cold, especially well-mixed and ventilated. The mid-latitudes, by contrast, especially on the western coasts of the continents, are characterized by marked oxygen-deficient zones. The oxygen supply here is very weak due to the sluggish water circulation, and this is further compounded by \u00adelevated oxygen consumption due to high biological productivity. This leads to a situation where the oxygen is almost completely depleted in the depth range between 100 and 1000 metres. This situation is also observed in the northern Indian Ocean in the area of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. ", "The world recalls Priestley best as the man who discovered oxygen, the active ingredient in our planet's atmosphere. In the process, he helped dethrone an idea that dominated science for 23 uninterrupted centuries: Few concepts 'have laid firmer hold upon the mind,' he wrote, than that air 'is a simple elementary substance, indestructible and unalterable.' In a series of experiments culminating in 1774, Priestley found that 'air is not an elementary substance, but a composition,' or mixture, of gases. Among them was the colorless and highly reactive gas he called 'dephlogisticated air,' to which the great French chemist Antoine Lavoisier would soon give the name 'oxygen.' It is hard to overstate the importance of Priestley's revelation. Scientists now recognize 92 naturally occurring elements-including nitrogen and oxygen, the main components of air. They comprise 78 and 21 percent of the atmosphere, respectively. Back to top ", "Oxygen first appeared in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere around 2 billion years ago, accumulating from the photosynthesis of blue-green algae. Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen passes into the atmosphere and the hydrogen joins with carbon dioxide to produce biomass.When living things need energy they take in oxygen for respiration. The oxygen returns to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Oxygen gas is fairly soluble in water, which makes aerobic life in rivers, lakes and oceans possible. Natural abundance Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere by volume. This is halfway between 17% (below which breathing for unacclimatised people becomes difficult) and 25% (above which many organic compounds are highly flammable). The element and its compounds make up 49.2% by mass of the Earth\u2019s crust, and about two-thirds of the human body. There are two key methods used to obtain oxygen gas. The first is by the distillation of liquid air. The second is to pass clean, dry air through a zeolite that absorbs nitrogen and leaves oxygen. A newer method, which gives oxygen of a higher purity, is to pass air over a partially permeable ceramic membrane.In the laboratory it can be prepared by the electrolysis of water or by adding a manganese(IV) oxide catalyst to aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Help text not available for this section currently History History Elements and Periodic Table History ", "Occurrence Oxygen is everywhere! It is the third most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium. It is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth\u2019s crust. Oxygen forms compounds with silicon and other atoms to form minerals like quartz and sand. It is the second most abundant gas in the atmosphere. About 21% of air is oxygen. However, oxygen is very reactive. It easily combines with other elements. It is replenished by plants and other photosynthetic organisms. Oxygen also makes up most of Earth\u2019s oceans by mass. A water molecule (H2O) is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Although there are more hydrogen atoms in water, hydrogen has less mass. By mass, water consists of nearly 90% oxygen. It is the most abundant element in the human body (by mass) because our bodies are 70% water. Oxygen means life Oxygen is vital for life. Most living things use oxygen for cellular respiration \u2013 the process by which cells obtain energy. Humans and other land animals breathe oxygen (as part of air) into lungs. Here it is absorbed into the blood and carried to the body\u2019s cells. Fish use gills to obtain dissolved oxygen from the water. Insects get their oxygen through small external openings called spiracles, which lead into a network of tubes called trachea. Plants also use oxygen for cellular respiration. In a separate process \u2013 photosynthesis \u2013 plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen. In low light, the photosynthesis rate is less than the respiration rate. In bright light, the photosynthesis rate is greater than the respiration rate and more oxygen is produced than used. The excess oxygen is released into the atmosphere. Nature of science ", "Dissolved oxygen in surface water is used by all forms of aquatic life; therefore, this constituent typically is measured to assess the 'health' of lakes and streams. Oxygen enters a stream from the atmosphere and from groundwater discharge. The contribution of oxygen from groundwater discharge is significant, however, only in areas where groundwater is a large component of streamflow, such as in areas of glacial deposits. Photosynthesis is the primary process affecting the dissolved-oxygen/temperature relation; water clarity and strength and duration of sunlight, in turn, affect the rate of photosynthesis.

The oxygen supply here is very weak due to the sluggish water circulation, and this is further compounded by \u00adelevated oxygen consumption due to high biological productivity. This leads to a situation where the oxygen is almost completely depleted in the depth range between 100 and 1000 metres. This situation is also observed in the northern Indian Ocean in the area of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. ", "https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/josephpriestleyoxygen.html\nThe world recalls Priestley best as the man who discovered oxygen, the active ingredient in our planet's atmosphere. In the process, he helped dethrone an idea that dominated science for 23 uninterrupted centuries: Few concepts 'have laid firmer hold upon the mind,' he wrote, than that air 'is a simple elementary substance, indestructible and unalterable.' In a series of experiments culminating in 1774, Priestley found that 'air is not an elementary substance, but a composition,' or mixture, of gases. Among them was the colorless and highly reactive gas he called 'dephlogisticated air,' to which the great French chemist Antoine Lavoisier would soon give the name 'oxygen.' It is hard to overstate the importance of Priestley's revelation. Scientists now recognize 92 naturally occurring elements-including nitrogen and oxygen, the main components of air. They comprise 78 and 21 percent of the atmosphere, respectively.

Green: once; dark green: twice; light green: planned Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup. Since the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the first tournament with multiple hosts. South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in 2010. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since Argentina 1978, and was the first occasion where consecutive World Cups were held outside Europe. Russian delegates celebrate being chosen as the host of the 2018 FIFA World Cup The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done under an exhaustive ballot system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a 'Hosting Agreement' from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. There have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, with Qatar becoming the first Middle Eastern country to host the tournament. For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament was rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation did not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.

{"ID": 265, "All Sources": ["The Camp David Accords were a pair of political agreements signed by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on 17 September 1978, following twelve days of secret negotiations at Camp David, the country retreat of the President of the United States in Maryland. The two framework agreements were signed at the White House and were witnessed by President Jimmy Carter. The second of these frameworks (A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel) led directly to the 1979 Egypt\u2013Israel peace treaty. Due to the agreement, Sadat and Begin received the shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. The first framework (A Framework for Peace in the Middle East), which dealt with the Palestinian territories, was written without participation of the Palestinians and was condemned by the United Nations. Preceding diplomacy Carter Initiative ", "Carter's acceptance of the proposed liaison scheme would have signaled American backing for Sadat's unprecedented peace initiative, but Carter rejected the proposal. However, Carter could not thwart the Israeli\u2013Egyptian peace push. Within days Israeli journalists were allowed into Cairo, breaking a symbolic barrier, and from there the peace process quickly gained momentum. An Israeli\u2013Egyptian working summit was scheduled for 25 December in Ismailiya, near the Suez Canal. Proceedings of the Camp David meeting Accompanied by their capable negotiating teams and with their respective interests in mind, the Israeli and Egyptian leaders Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat converged on Camp David for 13 days of tense and dramatic negotiations from 5 to 17 September 1978. ", "Consequently, the 13 days marking the Camp David Accords were considered a success, in part due to Carter's determination in obtaining an Israeli\u2013Egyptian agreement, which represented considerable time focused on a singular international problem. Additionally, Carter was beneficiary to a fully pledged American foreign team. Likewise, the Israeli delegation had a stable of excellent talent in Ministers Dayan and Weizman and legal experts Dr. Meir Rosenne and Aharon Barak. Furthermore, the absence of the media contributed to the Accord's successes: there were no possibilities provided to either leader to reassure his political body or be driven to conclusions by members of his opposition. An eventual scrap of negotiations by either leader would have proven disastrous, resulting in taking the blame for the summit's failure as well as a disassociation from the White House. Ultimately, neither Begin nor Sadat was willing to risk those eventualities. Both of them had invested enormous amounts of political capital and time to reach an agreement.

Problems playing this file? See media help. The Camp David Accords comprise two separate agreements: 'A Framework for Peace in the Middle East' and 'A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel', the second leading towards the Egypt\u2013Israel peace treaty signed in March 1979. The agreements and the peace treaty were both accompanied by 'side-letters' of understanding between Egypt and the U.S. and Israel and the U.S. The Accords recognized the 'legitimate rights of the Palestinian people', a process to be implemented guaranteeing the full autonomy of the people within a period of five years. The Israeli Prime Minister Begin insisted on the adjective 'full' to ensure that it was the maximum political right attainable; however, Begin also specifically insisted that 'on no condition will there be a Palestinian state'. This so-called 'full autonomy' was to be discussed with the participation of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians. The withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and Gaza was agreed to occur after an election of a self-governing authority to replace Israel's military government. The Accords did not mention the Golan Heights, Syria, or Lebanon. This was not the comprehensive peace that Kissinger, Ford, Carter, or Sadat had in mind during the previous American presidential transition. It was less clear than the agreements concerning the Sinai, and was later interpreted differently by Israel, Egypt, and the United States. The fate of Jerusalem was deliberately excluded from this agreement. ", "Israel also agreed to limit its forces a smaller distance (3 km) from the Egyptian border, and to guarantee free passage between Egypt and Jordan. With the withdrawal, Israel also returned Egypt's Abu-Rudeis oil fields in western Sinai, which contained long term, commercially productive wells. Consequences The Camp David accords changed Middle Eastern politics. Notably, the perception of Egypt within the Arab world changed. With the most powerful of the Arab militaries and a history of leadership in the Arab world under Nasser, Egypt had more leverage than any of the other Arab states to advance Arab interests. Egypt was subsequently suspended from the Arab League from 1979 until 1989. ", "the construction of Israeli settlements was quickly followed by the administration\u2019s failure to win support from Jordan or Saudi Arabia for the Accords. Beginning in October, a series of talks in Washington broke down as a result of Israeli concerns over the timing of their withdrawal and Egyptian reservations regarding the impact of a peace treaty on its obligations to other Arab states. Other regional developments, especially the Iranian Revolution, distracted U.S. policymakers and raised Israeli concerns about its oil supply, resulting in an impasse during the winter of 1978\u20131979. After Begin\u2019s visit to the White House in early March failed to break the stalemate, Carter traveled to Israel on March 10. Having previously secured Sadat\u2019s consent to negotiate on behalf of Egypt, the President engaged in three days of intensive talks with the Israelis. As a result of a series of compromises, notably a U.S. guarantee of ", "Camp David was followed on March 26, 1979 by a treaty of peace between Israel and the world\u2019s largest Arab country, Egypt. I will not deny that many of us on the Israeli negotiating team had, on the day of the agreement, deep doubts regarding the evacuation of the Sinai villages and the terms of Palestinian autonomy. But although there have been a few sad cases of human lives lost between Israelis and Egyptians since the treaty, by and large, the Camp David agreement should clearly be perceived as a great achievement. Remember that by 1978, Israel and Egypt had been at war five times since the founding of Israel in 1948\u2014that is, five wars in thirty years. The fact that over the past forty years there has been no war between both countries is in itself sufficient to view Camp David as a step of major historic importance. ", "On November 19, 1977, President Sadat received a warm welcome from the Israeli people, Prime Minister Begin, the Israeli government, and from the parliamentarians in the Israeli Knesset. Yet, following Sadat\u2019s visit, little progress was made in the way of peace between Israel and Egypt. There were a few meetings, however. Notable among the meetings was a visit by Begin to Ismailia on December 25, 1977, and a senior ministerial meeting in July 1978 in Leeds Castle, England. However, at the end of the summer, President Carter realized that negotiations were not progressing, and decided to convene the Camp David conference. It should be noted, though, that discussions at Leeds Castle informed some of the negotiations later at Camp David. ", "The Camp David Accords were followed by the Egyptian\u2013Israeli peace agreement, signed by the two leaders at the White House on March 26, 1979. The negotiations for the final peace treaty started in October 1978 at the Blair House\u2014the presidential guesthouse in Washington opposite the White House\u2014and while the main stipulations were almost fully ready by November, several issues, in particular the relationship between the treaty with Egypt and the Palestinian autonomy plan, and between the Defense Treaty of the Arab League and the peace treaty to be signed, necessitated another few months and a visit by President Carter to the region in March 1979 to finalize. It was done through agreed minutes, which when read look rather enigmatic, but never had to be invoked. The main provisions of the treaty included, inter alia, the military arrangements which divided Sinai into three areas with gradual limitation of military forces, a symbolic area on one side for the establishment of an international\u2014later multinational\u2014force, and normalization of relations, including resident embassies.

Principal photography on The Goonies began on October 22, 1984, and lasted five months. An additional six weeks of audio dubbing and recording were used. The shooting script was lengthy, at more than 120 pages, to which several sequences were eventually cut from the final theatrical version. During the film's d\u00e9nouement, mention is made of an octopus, which refers to a scene that was excised from the final cut. In the documentary The Making of The Goonies, Richard Donner noted both the difficulties and pleasures of working with so many child actors. He praised them for their energy and excitement, but also said that they were also unruly when brought together. As a result, the documentary frequently showed him coaching the actors and revealing some techniques he used to create realistic performances. One of these tricks involved One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship, which was actually a full-sized replica of a pirate ship created under the direction of production designer J. Michael Riva. Donner restricted the actors from seeing the ship until they filmed the scene wherein it is revealed to their characters; the characters' first glimpse of the ship was also the actors' first view of it, bringing about a more realistic performance. However, that particular scene in the final cut was actually the second take, due to the cast feeling so overwhelmed at first sight that the scene had to be reshot. The entire set was scrapped after shooting because they could not find anyone who wanted it. Some of the on-location filming was done in Astoria.

In the documentary The Making of The Goonies, Richard Donner noted both the difficulties and pleasures of working with so many child actors. He praised them for their energy and excitement, but also said that they were also unruly when brought together. As a result, the documentary frequently showed him coaching the actors and revealing some techniques he used to create realistic performances. One of these tricks involved One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship, which was actually a full-sized replica of a pirate ship created under the direction of production designer J. Michael Riva. Donner restricted the actors from seeing the ship until they filmed the scene wherein it is revealed to their characters; the characters' first glimpse of the ship was also the actors' first view of it, bringing about a more realistic performance. However, that particular scene in the final cut was actually the second take, due to the cast feeling so overwhelmed at first sight that the scene had to be reshot. The entire set was scrapped after shooting because they could not find anyone who wanted it. Some of the on-location filming was done in Astoria. The interior and exterior of the old Clatsop County Jail features as the holding place of Jake Fratelli at the start of the film. (The building was later converted into the Oregon Film Museum, which opened on the 25th anniversary of The Goonies with memorabilia from this and other local films.) The museum where Mikey's father works is, in reality, the Captain George Flavel House Museum. The Walsh family home is a real home on the eastern end of the town, at 368 38th Street. The road leading to the home was closed to tours in 2015. The scenes along the coast were filmed in Oregon, but they were a considerable distance from Astoria. The Goonies bicycle to Ecola State Park (in reality, in Cannon Beach, over 26 miles (42 km) south of Astoria) and then find the starting location of the map using Haystack Rock as a guide. Underground scenes were filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, including the cavernous set where the Goonies find One-Eyed Willy's ship, which was in Stage 16, one of the largest sound stages in the United States. \u001b[92m The final scene was shot at Goat Rock State Beach in Sonoma County, California\u001b[0m.

PEI joined the Canadian Confederation in 1873 as its smallest province. ", "The geography of Prince Edward Island is mostly pastoral with red soil, white sand, and scattered communities. Known as the 'Garden of the Gulf', the island is located in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence north of Nova Scotia and east of New Brunswick, with which it forms the Northumberland Strait. Overview Detailed map of Prince Edward Island Prince Edward Island (PEI) consists of the capital city Charlottetown, as well as urban towns Cornwall and Stratford and a developing urban fringe. A smaller urban area surrounds Summerside Harbour, situated on the southern shore 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of Charlottetown Harbour, and consists primarily of the city of Summerside. As with all natural harbours on the island, Charlottetown and Summerside harbours are created by rias. (See also a list of communities in Prince Edward Island.) The highest point of land is located at Springton in Queens County, rising 152 metres (499 ft) above sea level. The island's landscape is pastoral; rolling hills, pristine forests, white sand beaches, ocean coves and the red soil have given PEI a reputation as a province of outstanding natural beauty.[citation needed] A number of laws have been passed by the provincial government to attempt to preserve the landscape through regulation, although the lack of consistent enforcement and absence of province-wide zoning and land-use planning has resulted in some unsightly development in recent years. The island's lush landscape has had a strong bearing on the island's culture. During the late Victorian Era, author Lucy Maud Montgomery used the island as the setting of her novel Anne of Green Gables. Today, the island attracts tourists in all seasons, with popular leisure attractions including beaches, golf courses, and eco-tourism. Communities The coastline of the island consists of a combination of long beaches, dunes, red sandstone cliffs, saltwater marshes and numerous bays and harbours. The beaches, dunes and sandstone cliffs consist of sedimentary rock and other material with a high iron concentration which oxidizes upon exposure to the air. The geological properties of white silica sand found at Basin Head are unique in the province; the sand grains cause a scrubbing noise as they rub against each other under pressure. Large dune fields on the north shore can be found on barrier islands at the entrances to various bays and harbours. The sand dunes at Greenwich have a shifting, parabolic dune system that is home to a variety of birds and rare plants and is also a site of significant archaeological interest. Climate The climate of the island is a maritime climate considered to be moderate and strongly influenced by the surrounding seas. As such, it is milder than inland locations owing to the warm waters from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The climate is characterized by changeable weather throughout the year; it has some of the most variable day-to-day weather in Canada, in which specific weather conditions seldom last for long. Because the Gulf of Saint Lawrence freezes over, the island's climate is similar to a continental climate as opposed to an oceanic climate. During July and August, the average daytime high in PEI is 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F); however, the temperature can sometimes exceed 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) during these months. In the winter months of January and February, the average daytime high is \u22123.3 \u00b0C (26 \u00b0F). The Island receives an average yearly rainfall of 855 millimetres (33.7 in) and an average yearly snowfall of 2,850 millimetres (112 in). ", "^ 'Prince Edward Island'. The Canadian Encyclopedia.

Its range is confined to cold, boreal waters of the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. It is common in the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea, and in western Scandinavian waters south to Kattegat and \u00d8resund. It may also drift into the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea (where it cannot breed due to the low salinity). Similar jellyfish \u2013 which may be the same species \u2013 are known to inhabit seas near Australia and New Zealand. The largest recorded specimen was measured off the coast of Massachusetts in 1865 and had a bell with a diameter of 210 centimetres (7 feet) and tentacles around 36.6 m (120 ft) long.

Name The lion's mane jellyfish is also known as the arctic red jellyfish, hair jelly, snottie, sea blubber or giant jellyfish.[citation needed] Taxonomy Cyanea capillata, expanding (top), contracting (bottom) The taxonomy of the Cyanea species is not fully agreed upon; some zoologists have suggested that all species within the genus should be treated as one. Two distinct taxa, however, occur together in at least the eastern North Atlantic, with the blue jellyfish (Cyanea lamarckii P\u00e9ron & Lesueur, 1810) differing in color (blue, not red) and smaller size (10\u201320 cm [3+7\u20448\u20137+7\u20448 inches] diameter, rarely 35 cm [14 inches]).

In 2015, Russian researchers announced a possible sister species, Cyanea tzetlinii found in the White Sea. Description Lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) are named for their showy, trailing tentacles reminiscent of a lion's mane. They can vary greatly in size: although capable of attaining a bell diameter of over 2 m (6 ft 7 in), those found in lower latitudes are normally smaller than their far northern counterparts, with a bell about 50 cm (20 in) in diameter. Furthermore, larger specimens are typically further offshore than smaller ones. Juveniles are lighter orange or tan, very young lion's manes are occasionally colorless and adults are red and start to darken as they age.

Lion's mane jellyfish have four different stages in their year-long lifespan: a larval stage, a polyp stage, an ephyrae stage, and the medusa stage. The female jellyfish carries its fertilized eggs in a tentacle, where the eggs grow into larvae. When the larvae are old enough, the female deposits them on a hard surface, where the larvae soon grow into polyps. The polyps begin to reproduce asexually, creating stacks of small, immature medusae called ephyrae. The individual ephyrae break off from the stacks, where they eventually grow into the mature medusa stage to become full-grown jellyfish.

{"ID": 456, "All Sources": ["The divestment movement really took off in the United Kingdom in the 1960s when the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) called for an international conference on sanctions against South Africa. By calling for the complete divestment of funds from the nation the AAM sparked a turning point for the global call to end apartheid. Many organizations both in the U.K..and U.S. called for divestment at the federal, state, and local level as well as in private corporations and the education system. The divestment of funds from any of these sectors would mean a decrease in the value of the South African Rand and the complete destruction of the South African economy, forcing the apartheid regime to rethink their unequal legislation. ", "The Anti-Apartheid Movement at universities across the United States is where one is able to find some of the most vocal advocates for change. As early as 1977, major universities such as Ohio University, the University of Massachusetts, and Hampshire College had begun to divest funds from apartheid South Africa (ACOA, January 1982). By August 1988 155 universities across the United States had divested from South Africa, a huge spike since 1984, when only 53 universities had joined the cause. This spike in divestment correlates to the passing of the 1986 Anti-Apartheid Act by the US government and the further increase in public awareness to the atrocities occurring in South Africa. ", "The campaign to divest from South Africa gained prominence on university campuses in the United States in the mid-1980s; the debate headlined the October 1985 issue of Vassar College's student newspaper. The man pictured with his index finger raised is then-South African president P.W. Botha. Disinvestment (or divestment) from South Africa was first advocated in the 1960s in protest against South Africa's system of apartheid, but was not implemented on a significant scale until the mid-1980s. A disinvestment policy the U.S. adopted in 1986 in response to the disinvestment campaign is credited with playing a role in pressuring the South African government to embark on negotiations that ultimately led to the dismantling of the apartheid system. United Nations resolutions and embargos International opposition toapartheid in South Africa Campaigns Academic boycott Sporting boycott Disinvestment Constructive engagement Free South Africa Movement International anti-apartheid music ", "In a total rejection of apartheid, black South Africans mobilized to make the townships ungovernable, black local officials resigned in droves, and the government declared a State of Emergency in 1985 and used thousands of troops to quell 'unrest'. Television audiences throughout the world were to watch almost nightly reports of massive resistance to apartheid, the growth of a democratic movement, and the savage police and military response. The result of the widely televised South African response was 'a dramatic expansion of international actions to isolate apartheid, actions that combined with the internal situation to force dramatic changes in South Africa's international economic relations'. Higher education endowments Student anti-apartheid activists in the U.S. demanded that their colleges and universities divest from companies that traded or had operations in South Africa, and put pressure on boards of trustees. ", "The capital flight triggered a dramatic decline in the international exchange rate of the South African rand. The currency decline made imports more expensive, and this in turn caused inflation in South Africa to rise at a steep 12\u201315% per year. The South African government attempted to restrict the damaging outflow of capital. Knight writes that 'in September 1985 it imposed a system of exchange control and a debt repayments standstill. Under exchange control, South African residents are generally prohibited from removing capital from the country and foreign investors can only remove investments via the financial rand, which is traded at a 20% to 40% discount compared to the commercial rand. This means companies that disinvest get significantly fewer dollars for the capital they withdraw.' Criticism of disinvestment Within South Africa there was opposition to disinvestment among both black and white political leaders. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Chief Minister of KwaZulu and president of the Inkatha Freedom Party, slammed sanctions, stating that 'They can only harm all the people of Southern Africa. They can only lead to more hardships, particularly for the blacks.' The Members of Parliament Helen Suzman and Harry Schwarz, who opposed apartheid and were leaders of the Progressive Federal Party, also argued that disinvestment would cause further economic hardships for black people and that this would ultimately worsen the political climate for negotiations. Suzman said that such sanctions are 'self-defeating, wrecking the economy and do not assist anybody irrespective of race'. Schwarz said, 'Morality is cheap when someone else is paying.' ", "Dating as far back as the early 19th century, black Africans in South Africa were oppressed, first by the Dutch and British colonial governments and then by the Afrikaner government that took control of the country after their independence from Britain. Both officially and unofficially, black South Africans were radically oppressed in a grievous fashion. Though there was always some sentiment in the United States that conscientious Americans should not have been doing business with the racist Afrikaners, the protests at Columbia University were some of the first to bring the issue into the mainstream. The blockade action was not the first action by CFSA, but rather the frustrated culmination of years of activism by student leaders at Columbia. CFSA was formed in 1982 and since their early days frequently led protests in favor of divestment. In 1982, CFSA was able to convince the Student Senate, the most powerful student body on campus, to approve a motion to support divestiture. ", "Anti-apartheid protests took hold in the 1960s, particularly on the campuses of American colleges and universities. Initially, protesters wanted to end apartheid, but there were not many ways to influence the South African government using the traditional forms of protest such as picketing or demonstrations. Eventually, members of the college-based anti-apartheid movement thought of a more practical way to enact change by pressuring their universities to divest stocks of companies doing business in the country. Many students brought attention to their cause by building shanties on their own campuses to represent the living conditions many oppressed South Africans faced daily. Schools use a certain percentage of their endowment funds as an investment tool, and many schools have quite a large endowment fund. By 2021, more than 107 US schools had endowments of more than $1 billion, giving them an incredible amount of purchasing power. ", "While there were strong arguments against divestment, many students continued their protests. Eventually, college administrators saw it the students' way. The first school to agree to divest its portfolio of companies doing business in South Africa was Hampshire College. By 1988, a total of 155 colleges had at least partially divested. While the roots of the divestment movement took hold in America's college campuses, other large entities also soon sold their stocks. By the end of the decade, 90 cities, 22 counties, and 26 states had taken some form of economic stance against the South African government. As a result, many public pension funds were required to sell South African-related assets. Divestment movements were gaining ground in other countries as well. The college-based divestment efforts may or may not have played a role in immediately affecting the South African economy, but they did raise awareness about the problem of apartheid. After the divestment movement gained worldwide notoriety, U.S. Congress was moved to pass a series of economic sanctions against the South African government. From 1985 to 1990, over 200 U.S. companies cut all ties with South Africa, resulting in a loss of $1 billion in direct American investment. South Africa was ravaged by capital flight as businesses, investors, and money left the country. The rand, South Africa's currency, was significantly devalued and inflation reached double digits. The economic situation, as well as the resistance efforts of those suffering under apartheid, meant South Africa's system had to come to an end.

Television audiences throughout the world were to watch almost nightly reports of massive resistance to apartheid, the growth of a democratic movement, and the savage police and military response. The result of the widely televised South African response was 'a dramatic expansion of international actions to isolate apartheid, actions that combined with the internal situation to force dramatic changes in South Africa's international economic relations'. Higher education endowments Student anti-apartheid activists in the U.S. demanded that their colleges and universities divest from companies that traded or had operations in South Africa, and put pressure on boards of trustees. ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinvestment_from_South_Africa\nThe capital flight triggered a dramatic decline in the international exchange rate of the South African rand. The currency decline made imports more expensive, and this in turn caused inflation in South Africa to rise at a steep 12\u201315% per year. The South African government attempted to restrict the damaging outflow of capital. Knight writes that 'in September 1985 it imposed a system of exchange control and a debt repayments standstill. Under exchange control, South African residents are generally prohibited from removing capital from the country and foreign investors can only remove investments via the financial rand, which is traded at a 20% to 40% discount compared to the commercial rand. This means companies that disinvest get significantly fewer dollars for the capital they withdraw.' Criticism of disinvestment Within South Africa there was opposition to disinvestment among both black and white political leaders. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Chief Minister of KwaZulu and president of the Inkatha Freedom Party, slammed sanctions, stating that 'They can only harm all the people of Southern Africa. They can only lead to more hardships, particularly for the blacks.' The Members of Parliament Helen Suzman and Harry Schwarz, who opposed apartheid and were leaders of the Progressive Federal Party, also argued that disinvestment would cause further economic hardships for black people and that this would ultimately worsen the political climate for negotiations. Suzman said that such sanctions are 'self-defeating, wrecking the economy and do not assist anybody irrespective of race'. Schwarz said, 'Morality is cheap when someone else is paying.'

{"ID": 268, "All Sources": ["It was the first and only time until Super Bowl XLVIII in Super Bowl history that the league's number one-ranked offense (Raiders) was pitted against the league's number one-ranked defense (Buccaneers). Super Bowl XXXVII is also referred to as the 'Pirate Bowl', due to both teams' pirate-themed names. The game is sometimes referred to as the 'Gruden Bowl', because the primary storyline surrounding the game revolved around Jon Gruden. Gruden was the Raiders' head coach from 1998 to 2001, and then became the Buccaneers coach in 2002. Tampa Bay, 'Gruden's new team', made their first Super Bowl appearance in team history after posting a 12\u20134 regular season record. Oakland, 'Gruden's old team', advanced to their fifth Super Bowl after an 11\u20135 regular season. This was also the first Super Bowl to feature two former division rivals, as the Buccaneers and Raiders both played in the AFC West in 1976. The Raiders came into the game as four-point favorites. However, the Tampa Bay defense dominated the contest. Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon threw a Super Bowl record five interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. The Buccaneers also sacked Gannon five times, and scored 34 consecutive points to build a 34\u20133 lead late in the third quarter. Tampa Bay safety Dexter Jackson, who had two of those interceptions and returned them for 34 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Jackson became only the second safety and third defensive back named Super Bowl MVP. Background ", "Raiders owner Al Davis was known to have the lowest salaries for coaches in the league, and Gruden was no exception. Instead of paying a high salary for Gruden, Davis opted to trade the rights for Gruden to the Buccaneers in exchange for four draft picks, in a deal similar to what Patriots owner Robert Kraft made with the New York Jets to get head coach Bill Belichick in 2000. The Buccaneers ended up giving two first-round picks, two second-round picks and $8 million to the Raiders to get Gruden. Tampa Bay was desperate to have someone rebuild their offense so it would complement their powerful defense in an attempt to win the Super Bowl. ", "The season began with the team trying to improve on a 9\u20137 season and did so with a franchise-best 12\u20134 record. It was Jon Gruden's first season as the Buccaneers\u2019 head coach. They won the Super Bowl for the first time in the team's history, beating the Oakland Raiders 48\u201321. This was Tampa Bay's only Super Bowl appearance and win until 2020, with the Super Bowl win also being their most recent playoff game win in the same span. The 2002 Buccaneers\u2019 defense, which included four players who would eventually be elected the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is often cited as one of the best ever, as well as one of the most potent pass defenses in league history. In 2019, the NFL ranked the 2002 Buccaneers as the 45th best NFL team of all time. Summary 'Pound the rock!' was the slogan of the 2002 team ", "The offense made slight improvements during the season, but the strength of the team was the defense. The 2002 Buccaneers became the first team to lead the league in total defense, points allowed, and interceptions since the 1985 Chicago Bears. They also held opposing quarterbacks to an unbelievable 48.4 passer rating for the season. Led by this dominating defense, the 2002 Buccaneers achieved their most successful season to date. They won the NFC South title with the team's best ever record, 12\u20134, and then defeated the 49ers in what became coach Steve Mariucci\u2019s last game with that franchise. In a surprising upset, Tampa Bay won their first NFC Championship on the road against the Eagles in the last NFL game ever played at Veterans Stadium. Cornerback Ronde Barber capped off the win by intercepting a Donovan McNabb pass and returning it 92 yards for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter. ", "As many sports fans and writers predicted, Gruden's prior knowledge of the Raiders was a major factor in the Buccaneers\u2019 win in Super Bowl XXXVII. The most damaging piece of evidence is NFL Films footage of Tampa Bay safety John Lynch telling his teammates during the game that almost all of the plays ran by Oakland's offense were plays that Gruden (who that week even played the part of 'Rich Gannon' by playing quarterback with the scout-team offense) specifically told them to look out for. Better still for the Buccaneers was the fact that Oakland hadn't changed their audible-calling signals that Gruden himself had installed, thus tipping off plays repeatedly. As a result, Tampa Bay dominated Oakland, outgaining them in total yards (365 to 269), rushing yards (150 to 19), first downs (24 to 11), offensive plays (76 to 60), and forced turnovers (5 to 1). The Raiders had a great chance to score a touchdown early in the game after cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Buccaneers quarterback Brad Johnson's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 12 yards to the Tampa Bay 36-yard line. But 6 plays later, Tampa Bay defensive end Simeon Rice sacked Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon on third down, forcing Oakland to settle for kicker Sebastian Janikowski's 40-yard field goal to give them a 3\u20130 lead. Buccaneers kick returner Aaron Stecker returned the ensuing kickoff 27 yards to the 29-yard line, then appeared to fumble the ball. Although the officials initially ruled that the ball was recovered by Oakland's Eric Johnson, the play was reviewed by instant replay and the fumble was overturned, and thus Tampa Bay retained possession. On the first play of the drive, Brad Johnson completed an 11-yard pass to receiver Joe Jurevicius. Johnson's next 2 passes were incomplete, but he then completed a 23-yard pass to Jurevicius on third down to advance the ball to the Oakland 37-yard line. Running back Michael Pittman then rushed for a 23-yard gain to the 13-yard line. However, on the next three plays, the Raiders defense limited the Buccaneers to a pair of incompletions and a 1-yard run. Kicker Martin Gramatica then made a 31-yard field goal to tie the game, 3\u20133. ", "Tampa Bay responded by moving the ball to the Oakland 9-yard line on their ensuing drive, featuring a 24-yard run by Pittman, but they came up empty after Tupa fumbled the snap on a field goal attempt. A few plays later, Gannon threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Rice with 6:06 left in the game, cutting the Raiders' deficit to 34\u201321. Rice became the first player to catch a touchdown pass in four different Super Bowls, and third overall to have touchdowns in four Super Bowls (Thurman Thomas and John Elway). The two-point conversion failed when Jerry Porter caught the ball and was forced out of bounds; while the official did not judge it to be a force-out, (judgement call) hence, that part of the play was non reviewable.

It engages readers, builds anticipation, and creates a desire to know what happens next. This blog post aims to demonstrate the creative universality of story structure with a plot analysis of the classic novel Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery. By David G Brown Anne of Green Gables tells the story of a young orphan girl named Anne Shirley who is mistakenly sent to live with a pair of elderly siblings, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, on Prince Edward Island. Despite Marilla\u2019s initial reluctance to keep her, Anne's charm, intelligence, and imaginative spirit soon win over their hearts and those of the entire community. Coming of Age A coming-of-age narrative, also known as a bildungsroman, is often structured differently than most novels. The overall trajectory involves the character growing up through a series of formative experiences, but if we dig into the different relationship threads, it\u2019s usually possible to find the one goal that forms the story\u2019s backbone. To put that another way, the primary narrative goal is an arrow fired in the inciting incident which will hit a target in the climax. However, in a coming-of-age story, that goal isn\u2019t necessarily something the protagonist pursues on every page. Anne of Green Gables offers many episodic threads that work together to deeply characterize herself, her adoptive parents, and many of the other residents of Avonlea. There is one thread, however, that directly connects the inciting incident with the climax: her relationship with Matthew. Narrative Goal Anne\u2019s narrative journey is primarily relational\u2014she wants to be accepted and loved, but she also has an irrepressible desire to speak her mind and express herself. Therefore, the plot grows out of several relationship threads in which Anne strives for love and acceptance. Her obstacles include the town\u2019s initial prejudices toward orphans and Anne\u2019s blunt tongue and temper. Anne\u2019s narrative goal crystalizes in her cart ride from the train station to her new home in Avonlea\u2014a scene in which it\u2019s clear Anne and Matthew have an instant bond.

Plot Points Stasis Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, aging and unmarried siblings, decide to adopt a boy to help them around the farm. Anne is an orphan and has been moving from one foster home to another before she is sent by mistake to the Green Gables farm in Avonlea. Inciting incident ", "Anne of Green Gables is a 1908 novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery (published as L. M. Montgomery). Written for all ages, it has been considered a classic children's novel since the mid-20th century. Set in the late 19th century, the novel recounts the adventures of an 11-year-old orphan girl Anne Shirley sent by mistake to two middle-aged siblings, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, who had originally intended to adopt a boy to help them on their farm in the fictional town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The novel recounts how Anne makes her way through life with the Cuthberts, in school, and within the town. Since its publication, Anne of Green Gables has been translated into at least 36 languages and has sold more than 50 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books worldwide to date in any language. It was the first of many novels; Montgomery wrote numerous sequels, and since her death another sequel has been published, as well as an authorized prequel titled Before Green Gables. This prequel was written in 2008 by Budge Wilson to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the book series. The original book is taught to students around the world. The book has been adapted as films, television films, and animated and live-action television series. Musicals and plays have also been created, with productions annually in Canada, Europe and Japan.

L.M. Montgomery also wrote two other collections of stories set in the same fictional world of Prince Edward Island that mention Anne Shirley. The series follows the life of an orphan named Anne Shirley and how she goes through everyday life with her optimistic and introspective outlook. Through it all we see her develop lifelong friends, get her first kiss, find true love, make tough decisions, and ultimately show a strength of character readers can\u2019t help but identify with.

For example, if we flip a coin in the air and get the outcome as Head, then again if we flip the coin but this time we get the outcome as Tail. In both cases, the occurrence of both events is independent of each other. It is one of the types of events in probability. Let us learn here the complete definition of independent events along with its Venn diagram, examples and how it is different from mutually exclusive events. What are Independent Events? In Probability, the set of outcomes of an experiment is called events. There are different types of events such as independent events, dependent events, mutually exclusive events, and so on. If the probability of occurrence of an event A is not affected by the occurrence of another event B, then A and B are said to be independent events. ", "Two events [latex]A[/latex] and [latex]B[/latex] are independent if the knowledge that one occurred does not affect the chance the other occurs. For example, the outcomes of two roles of a fair die are independent events. The outcome of the first roll does not change the probability for the outcome of the second roll. To show two events are independent, you must show only one of the above conditions. If two events are NOT independent, then we say that they are dependent. Sampling may be done with replacement or without replacement. With replacement: If each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, then that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once. When sampling is done with replacement, then events are considered to be independent, meaning the result of the first pick will not change the probabilities for the second pick. ", "alone. A similar equation holds for the conditional probability density functions in the continuous case. Independence can be seen as a special kind of conditional independence, since probability can be seen as a kind of conditional probability given no events. History Before 1933, independence, in probability theory, was defined in a verbal manner. For example, de Moivre gave the following definition: 'Two events are independent, when they have no connexion one with the other, and that the happening of one neither forwards nor obstructs the happening of the other'. If there are n independent events, the probability of the event, that all of them happen was computed as the product of the probabilities of these n events. Apparently, there was the conviction, that this formula was a consequence of the above definition. (Sometimes this was called the Multiplication Theorem.), Of course, a proof of his assertion cannot work without further more formal tacit assumptions. The definition of independence, given in this article, became the standard definition (now used in all books) after it appeared in 1933 as part of Kolmogorov's axiomatization of probability. Kolmogorov credited it to S.N. Bernstein, and quoted a publication which had appeared in Russian in 1927. Unfortunately, both Bernstein and Kolmogorov had not been aware of the work of the Georg Bohlmann. Bohlmann had given the same definition for two events in 1901 and for n events in 1908 In the latter paper, he studied his notion in detail. For example, he gave the first example showing that pairwise independence does not imply imply mutual independence. Even today, Bohlmann is rarely quoted. More about his work can be found in On the contributions of Georg Bohlmann to probability theory from de:Ulrich Krengel.

Note carefully that, as is the case with just two events, this is not a formula that is always valid, but holds precisely when the events in question are independent. Example \\(\\PageIndex{8}\\): redundancy The reliability of a system can be enhanced by redundancy, which means building two or more independent devices to do the same job, such as two independent braking systems in an automobile.

Two events A and B are said to be independent if the fact that one event has occurred does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other. Also if the occurrence of one event affects the probability of occurrence of the other event, then the two events are said to be dependent. Can an Event Be Mutually Exclusive and Independent Event? Mutually exclusive in math are a set of events that cannot happen at the same time. For example: when tossing a coin, the result can either be heads or tails but cannot be both. This of course means mutually exclusive events are not independent, and independent events cannot be mutually exclusive. Are Independent Events Disjoint? ", "Dependent Events Dependent events are those events that are affected by the outcomes of events that had already occurred previously. i.e. Two or more events that depend on one another are known as dependent events. If one event is by chance changed, then another is likely to differ. Thus, If whether one event occurs does affect the probability that the other event will occur, then the two events are said to be dependent. When the occurrence of one event affects the occurrence of another subsequent event, the two events are dependent events. The concept of dependent events gives rise to the concept of conditional probability which will be discussed in the article further. Examples of Dependent Events For Example, let\u2019s say three cards are to be drawn from a pack of cards. Then the probability of getting a king is highest when the first card is drawn, while the probability of getting a king would be less when the second card is drawn.

Examples of Dependent Events are, The probability of finding a red ball from a box of 4 red balls and 3 green balls changes if we take out two balls from the box. Mutually Exclusive Events Two events A and B are said to be mutually exclusive events if they cannot occur at the same time. Mutually exclusive events never have an outcome in common. If we take two events A and B as mutually exclusive events where the probability of event A is P(A) and the probability of event B is P(B) then the probability of happening both events together is, P(A\u2229B) = 0 Then the probability of occurring any one event is, P(AUB) = P(A) or P(B) = P(A) + P(B) Conditional Probability Formula ", "Two events are said to be independent if one event occurring does not affect the probability that the other event will occur. However, if one event occurring (or not occurring) does affect the likelihood that the other event will happen, the two events are said to be dependent.

If events are independent, then the probability of event B occurring is not contingent on what happens with event A.

During the war, North American Patriot forces had the support of France, Spain and the Dutch Republic, while the British and Loyalist forces hired Hessian soldiers from Germany for assistance.

Combined with the Proclamation of Rebellion, issued on August 23 in response to the Battle at Bunker Hill, it ended hopes of a peaceful settlement. Backed by the Whigs, Parliament initially rejected the imposition of coercive measures by 170 votes, fearing an aggressive policy would simply drive the Americans towards independence.

{"ID": 459, "All Sources": ["The vast majority of the value of U.S. dollar payments, or transfers, in the United States is ultimately processed through wholesale payment systems, which generally handle large-value transactions between banks. Banks conduct these transfers on their own behalf as well as for the benefit of other financial service providers and bank customers, both corporate and consumer. Related retail transfer systems facilitate transactions such as automated clearing houses (ACH); automated teller machines (ATM); point-of-sale (POS); telephone bill paying; home banking systems; and credit, debit, and prepaid cards. Most of these retail transactions are initiated by customers rather than by banks or corporate users. These individual transactions may then be batched in order to form larger wholesale transfers, which are the focus of this section. The two primary domestic wholesale payment systems for interbank funds transfers are the Fedwire Funds Service (Fedwire\u00ae) ", "In 2022, the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) Bank celebrated its 20 years of service. The solution has been playing a key role in supporting the FX market, growing from USD 1.2 trillion in 2001 to USD 6.5 trillion in 2022 in daily transactions amounts.* Let us take advantage of this milestone to reassess the benefits of CLS. What is CLS? CLS is an independent multi-currency settlement system for FX transactions. Able to manage 18 currencies, it handles an average of one million daily transactions worth over USD 6.5 trillion (source: CLS, H1 2022 figures). 'Over 70 of the world\u2019s most important financial institutions choose to be direct members of CLS, and over 30,000 more market participants benefit from the use of our services. As we celebrate our 20th anniversary, we reflect on why these clients place their trust in us every day and what we deliver to them in return \u2013 now and in the future,' said Marc Bayle de Jess\u00e9, CLS CEO, in the article celebrating the CLS 20 years of service. CLS was originally created to mitigate settlement risk, i.e. the risk of default of one of the counterparties[1], as a FX transaction is composed of two non-simultaneous cash flows. A good example is a USD/JPY transaction: Outside CLS, the seller settles his JPY on T-1, whilst the buyer settles the USD on T.With CLS, the two flows are simultaneously settled. This is the Payment versus Payment (PvP) principle. The primary advantage of CLS: reducing risk International banks have been the first to adopt the CLS system in order to reduce their FX settlement risk, also called 'Herstatt risk'. For a bit of history, in 1974, the bankruptcy of the German bank Herstatt blocked the dollar interbank payment system. Herstatt\u2019s American counterparties found themselves with unsecured claims due to the time difference of their unsettled transactions with their German counterparts. Nowadays, this type of issue is something that would not happen to CLS users. ", "Moving towards a broader adoption of CLS? Since 2020, market conditions have been putting CLS benefits to the test, even for participants with relatively limited FX volumes. Institutional investors can use CLS to different ends. An asset manager can use CLS to optimise and simplify the operational processes of its forex transactions. An insurer, a pension fund or a sovereign wealth fund may be driven by the goal of making their FX transactions and assets more secure. A corporation may settle its FX trades in CLS to streamline FX post-trade processes. Even international authorities \u2013 such as the central banks of the currencies covered by CLS or the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) \u2013 have long recognised the fundamental role of CLS in ensuring the stability and economic security of FX settlements between financial institutions. However, CLS does not cover all FX transactions. Some participants are constrained by the 18-currency scope. Others deal in more complex transactions than traditional derivatives or process same day transactions, which are not part of the CLS processing scope. Our forward looking view for CLS While Continuous Linked Settlement is a mature service seen as the industry gold standard for FX settlement, the service is still gaining traction with new participants joining the platform on a regular basis. As of writing, the community is mostly made of investment funds and banks (97%). Whereas, the corporate segment is still to tap into the benefits of CLS, currently representing less than 0.3% of participants (as of December 2021). We expect the adoption of CLS by this segment to grow in upcoming years. Outside of that growth factor, we expect the overall usage of CLS to grow in the pursuit of three key drivers: FX counterparty access: ", "A form of netting which occurs following some predefined events, such as default. Close-out netting establishes a close-out payment based on the net present value of future cash flows due between a bank and a defaulting counterparty. Close-out netting is intended to reduce exposures on open contracts with a defaulting counterparty. (Also referred to as 'default netting,' 'open contract netting' or 'replacement contract netting'). CLS Bank International (CLS Bank) Owned by the foreign exchange community, CLS Bank operates a multi-currency PVP cash settlement system to mitigate settlement risk in the foreign exchange market. Confirmation and affirmation ", "An arrangement in which one bank (correspondent) holds deposits owned by other banks (respondents) and provides payment and other services to those respondent banks. Such arrangements may also be known as 'agency relationships' in some domestic contexts. In international banking, balances held for a foreign respondent bank may be used to settle FX transactions. Reciprocal correspondent banking relationships may involve the use of nostro and vostro accounts to settle foreign exchange transactions. Credit support annex (ISDA CSA) ", "A service that enables a bank\u2019s customer to conduct transactions in the name of the bank (the prime broker). The prime broker sets up an arrangement that permits the customer to trade directly with dealers in the name of the prime broker. These dealers recognise the prime broker (not the customer) as the counterparty in these trades. Principal risk The risk of outright loss of the full value of a transaction resulting from the counterparty\u2019s failure to settle. This can arise from paying away the currency being sold, but failing to receive the currency being bought. (Also referred to as 'Herstatt risk'). Principal risk duration ", "including SWIFT and Austraclear. These include payments that settle through CLS, a multi-currency settlement system designed to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk. RITS also includes the Fast Settlement Service (FSS), which settles transactions submitted via the New Payments Platform (NPP) feeder system on an RTGS basis. The FSS has been designed to quickly settle individual transactions, including payments made by consumers and businesses, 24 hours per day and 7 days a week. Some settlement obligations are settled in RITS periodically on a multilaterally netted basis. This includes obligations arising from payments exchanged through low-value clearing systems for cheques, direct entry and retail card transactions. Obligations arising from direct entry payments are settled on a same-day basis, while cheque and retail card obligations are settled on a deferred basis the following day around 9.00 am. These obligations are sent to RITS via the Low Value Settlement Service (LVSS), ", "same as for RITS, i.e. 99.95 per cent, equivalent to downtime of around 3 hours each year (due to the longer core operating hours of LVCS compared to RITS). The RBA does not specify quarterly availability targets for RITS, FSS nor the LVCS. Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) CLS is a global initiative designed to reduce foreign exchange (FX) settlement risk. The process is facilitated by a simultaneous settlement of the bought and sold currencies of each FX transaction across the books of CLS Bank International (CLS Bank). CLS Bank connects to each of the national RTGS systems and holds a central bank account for each participating currency.

Banks conduct these transfers on their own behalf as well as for the benefit of other financial service providers and bank customers, both corporate and consumer. Related retail transfer systems facilitate transactions such as automated clearing houses (ACH); automated teller machines (ATM); point-of-sale (POS); telephone bill paying; home banking systems; and credit, debit, and prepaid cards. Most of these retail transactions are initiated by customers rather than by banks or corporate users. These individual transactions may then be batched in order to form larger wholesale transfers, which are the focus of this section. The two primary domestic wholesale payment systems for interbank funds transfers are the Fedwire Funds Service (Fedwire\u00ae) ", "https://securities.cib.bnpparibas/foreign-exchange-market-benefits-of-cls/\nIn 2022, the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) Bank celebrated its 20 years of service. The solution has been playing a key role in supporting the FX market, growing from USD 1.2 trillion in 2001 to USD 6.5 trillion in 2022 in daily transactions amounts.* Let us take advantage of this milestone to reassess the benefits of CLS. What is CLS? CLS is an independent multi-currency settlement system for FX transactions. Able to manage 18 currencies, it handles an average of one million daily transactions worth over USD 6.5 trillion (source: CLS, H1 2022 figures). 'Over 70 of the world\u2019s most important financial institutions choose to be direct members of CLS, and over 30,000 more market participants benefit from the use of our services. As we celebrate our 20th anniversary, we reflect on why these clients place their trust in us every day and what we deliver to them in return \u2013 now and in the future,' said Marc Bayle de Jess\u00e9, CLS CEO, in the article celebrating the CLS 20 years of service. CLS was originally created to mitigate settlement risk, i.e. the risk of default of one of the counterparties[1], as a FX transaction is composed of two non-simultaneous cash flows. A good example is a USD/JPY transaction: Outside CLS, the seller settles his JPY on T-1, whilst the buyer settles the USD on T.With CLS, the two flows are simultaneously settled. This is the Payment versus Payment (PvP) principle. The primary advantage of CLS: reducing risk International banks have been the first to adopt the CLS system in order to reduce their FX settlement risk, also called 'Herstatt risk'. For a bit of history, in 1974, the bankruptcy of the German bank Herstatt blocked the dollar interbank payment system. Herstatt\u2019s American counterparties found themselves with unsecured claims due to the time difference of their unsettled transactions with their German counterparts. Nowadays, this type of issue is something that would not happen to CLS users. ", "https://securities.cib.bnpparibas/foreign-exchange-market-benefits-of-cls/\nMoving towards a broader adoption of CLS? Since 2020, market conditions have been putting CLS benefits to the test, even for participants with relatively limited FX volumes. Institutional investors can use CLS to different ends. An asset manager can use CLS to optimise and simplify the operational processes of its forex transactions. An insurer, a pension fund or a sovereign wealth fund may be driven by the goal of making their FX transactions and assets more secure. A corporation may settle its FX trades in CLS to streamline FX post-trade processes. Even international authorities \u2013 such as the central banks of the currencies covered by CLS or the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) \u2013 have long recognised the fundamental role of CLS in ensuring the stability and economic security of FX settlements between financial institutions. However, CLS does not cover all FX transactions. Some participants are constrained by the 18-currency scope. Others deal in more complex transactions than traditional derivatives or process same day transactions, which are not part of the CLS processing scope. Our forward looking view for CLS While Continuous Linked Settlement is a mature service seen as the industry gold standard for FX settlement, the service is still gaining traction with new participants joining the platform on a regular basis. As of writing, the community is mostly made of investment funds and banks (97%). Whereas, the corporate segment is still to tap into the benefits of CLS, currently representing less than 0.3% of participants (as of December 2021). We expect the adoption of CLS by this segment to grow in upcoming years. Outside of that growth factor, we expect the overall usage of CLS to grow in the pursuit of three key drivers: FX counterparty access: ", "https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/settlement-risk-foreign-exchange-transactions-guideline-2013\nA form of netting which occurs following some predefined events, such as default.

Treaties are binding agreements between nations and become part of international law. Treaties to which the United States is a party also have the force of federal legislation, forming part of what the Constitution calls ''the supreme Law of the Land.'' The Senate does not ratify treaties. Following consideration by the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Senate either approves or rejects a resolution of ratification. If the resolution passes, then ratification takes place when the instruments of ratification are formally exchanged between the United States and the foreign power(s). The Senate has considered and approved for ratification all but a small number of treaties negotiated by the president and his representatives. In some cases, when Senate leadership believed a treaty lacked sufficient support for approval, the Senate simply did not vote on the treaty and it was eventually withdrawn by the president. Since pending treaties are not required to be resubmitted at the beginning of each new Congress, they may remain under consideration by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for an extended period of time. In recent decades, presidents have frequently entered the United States into international agreements without the advice and consent of the Senate. These are called 'executive agreements.'

Germans designed the airship to use it because they believed that they could convince the US government to license its export. That didn\u2019t happen. Hindenburg made its maiden test flight on March 4, 1936 with 87 passengers and crew aboard. After six trial flights made over a three-week period the Hindenburg was ready for public flight with a 6,598 km propaganda flight around Germany. Its first commercial passenger flight, a four-day transatlantic voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Hindenburg flew on March 31. It had 63 flights in total. The last flight of Hindenburg was from 3 to 6 May 1937. Hindenburg left Frankfurt for Lakehurst on the evening of May 3. It was its first scheduled round trip between Europe and North America. Three days of routine flight later it approached for a landing. There were thunderstorms passing over Lakehurst so ", "The Hindenburg disaster was an airship accident that occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, U.S. The LZ 129 Hindenburg (Luftschiff Zeppelin #129; Registration: D-LZ 129) was a German commercial passenger-carrying rigid airship, the lead ship of the Hindenburg class, the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume. It was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH) and operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei). It was named after Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who was president of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. Filled with hydrogen, it caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst. The accident caused 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen) among the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), and an additional fatality on the ground. The disaster was the subject of newsreel coverage, photographs and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. A variety of theories have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The publicity shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era. Flight Background The Hindenburg made ten trips to the United States in 1936. After opening its 1937 season by completing a single round-trip passage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in late March, the Hindenburg departed from Frankfurt, Germany, on the evening of May 3, on the first of ten round trips between Europe and the United States that were scheduled for its second year of commercial service. American Airlines had contracted with the operators of the Hindenburg to shuttle passengers from Lakehurst to Newark for connections to airplane flights. ", "Hindenburg had a duralumin structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads along its length, with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship's outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater's skins. In 1931 the Zeppelin Company purchased 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) of duralumin salvaged from the wreckage of the October 1930 crash of the British airship R101. Dining room Lounge, with the world map painted on the wall Hindenburg's ", "Four years after construction began in 1932, Hindenburg made its maiden test flight from the Zeppelin dockyards at Friedrichshafen on March 4, 1936, with 87 passengers and crew aboard. These included the Zeppelin Company chairman, Dr. Hugo Eckener, as commander, former World War I Zeppelin commander Lt. Col. Joachim Breithaupt representing the German Air Ministry, the Zeppelin Company's eight airship captains, 47 other crew members, and 30 dockyard employees who flew as passengers. Harold G. Dick was the only non-Luftschiffbau representative aboard. Although the name Hindenburg had been quietly selected by Eckener over a year earlier, only the airship's formal registration number (D-LZ129) and the five Olympic rings (promoting the 1936 Summer Olympics to be held in Berlin that August) were displayed on the hull during its trial flights. As the airship passed over Munich on its second trial flight the next afternoon, the city's Lord Mayor, Karl Fiehler, asked Eckener by radio the LZ129's name, to which he replied 'Hindenburg'. On March 23, Hindenburg made its first passenger and mail flight, carrying 80 reporters from Friedrichshafen to L\u00f6wenthal. The ship flew over Lake Constance with Graf Zeppelin. ", "On October 8, 1936, Hindenburg made a 10.5 hour flight (the 'Millionaires Flight') over New England carrying 72 wealthy and influential passengers including financier and future U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winthrop W. Aldrich, his 28-year-old nephew Nelson Rockefeller, who became the Governor of New York and, later, Vice President of the United States, various German and American government officials and military officers, as well as key figures in the aviation industry, including Juan Trippe, founder and Chief Executive of Pan American Airways, and World War I flying ace Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, president of Eastern Airlines. The ship arrived at Boston by noon and returned to Lakehurst at 5:22 pm before making its final transatlantic flight of the season back to Frankfurt. ", "Hindenburg also had an experimental aircraft hook-on trapeze similar to the one on the U.S. Navy Goodyear\u2013Zeppelin built airships Akron and Macon. This was intended to allow customs officials to be flown out to Hindenburg to process passengers before landing and to retrieve mail from the ship for early delivery. Experimental hook-ons and takeoffs, piloted by Ernst Udet, were attempted on March 11 and April 27, 1937, but were not very successful, owing to turbulence around the hook-up trapeze. The loss of the ship ended all prospects of further testing. Final flight: May 3\u20136, 1937 Main article: Hindenburg disaster After making the first South American flight of the 1937 season in late March, Hindenburg left Frankfurt for Lakehurst on the evening of 3 May, on its first scheduled round trip between Europe and North America that season. Although strong headwinds slowed the crossing, the flight had otherwise proceeded routinely as it approached for a landing three days later. Hindenburg's arrival on 6 May was delayed for several hours to avoid a line of thunderstorms passing over Lakehurst, but around 7:00 pm the airship was cleared for its final approach to the Naval Air Station, which it made at an altitude of 200 m (660 ft) with Captain Max Pruss in command. At 7:21 pm a pair of landing lines were dropped from the nose of the ship and were grabbed hold of by ground handlers. Four minutes later, at 7:25 pm Hindenburg burst into flames and dropped to the ground in a little over half a minute. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crew aboard, 13 passengers and 22 crew died, as well as one member of the ground crew, a total of 36 lives lost. Herbert Morrison's commentary of the incident became a classic of audio history. ", "On May 6, 1937, the rigid German airship Hindenburg arrived at its Lakehurst, NJ, Naval Air Station destination after departing Frankfurt, Germany 3 days earlier. A crowded landing field of newspaper and radio journalists, film and still camera people, family, friends, and ground crew waited for the airship despite arriving hours behind schedule. As the Hindenburg prepared to dock with its mooring mast, it suddenly burst into flames forcing passengers and crew to jump from windows to escape the inferno. In seconds, the airship was completely destroyed and 36 people were dead. The disaster was immortalized as the first major aviation accident captured by photographs, sound recordings, and motion picture film. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH built the rigid passenger airship Hindenburg (LZ129) between 1931 and 1936 at its facility in Friedrichshafen, Germany. The first in its class of rigid airships, the Hindenburg remains the largest commercial airship ever built and flown, measuring nearly 804 feet long and 135 feet in diameter. Constructed using treated cotton canvas fabric stretched over an aluminum alloy frame, the 242 ton airship was held aloft by more than 7 million cubic feet of hydrogen gas. Four diesel-driven propeller engines drove the zeppelin to speeds of up to 84 miles per hour, while carrying 50 passengers, 60 or more crew members, and more than 21,000 pounds of cargo. Completed at the height of the Great Depression, passengers nevertheless eagerly paid approximately $450 for a one-way ticket\u2014more than $8,750 in 2022 dollars\u2014for the 2- to 3-day voyage between Frankfurt, Germany, and Lakehurst, NJ. Sleeping quarters were spartan, consisting of private cabins with cots or bunk beds and a shared bathroom, but the airship's other amenities rivaled the finest ocean liners.

Completed at the height of the Great Depression, passengers nevertheless eagerly paid approximately $450 for a one-way ticket\u2014more than $8,750 in 2022 dollars\u2014for the 2- to 3-day voyage between Frankfurt, Germany, and Lakehurst, NJ.

Based on the best-selling book series by L.J. Smith, The Vampire Diaries was developed for the small screen by Dawson\u2019s Creek creator Kevin Williamson with his long-time collaborator Julie Plec and premiered on The CW in 2009. Set in the picturesque, but paranormal town of Mystic Falls, the long-running series focused on the vampire love triangle between protagonists Elena (Nina Dobrev), Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) and his brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder), alongside the town\u2019s other human and not-so-human inhabitants. The Vampire Diaries spawned not one, but two spinoffs \u2013 The Originals and Legacies \u2013 and developed a loyal fan following over its eight seasons on the air. The show enjoyed a good run and its season 8 finale wrapped up most of its unresolved storylines nicely in an epic episode that featured some major character deaths and a few happy endings. Related: Preacher Finally Reveals How Cassidy Became A Vampire Despite its satisfying finale fans of the show still hope another season might be on the cards, but could The Vampire Diaries season 9 ever happen? The CW Canceled The Vampire Diaries In 2017 Just a few months after The CW renewed the show for its eighth season, showrunner Julie Plec announced The Vampire Diaries would end with season 8, feeling the show had come to a natural end. Fans may have been disappointed then, but the knowledge that season 8 would be the show\u2019s last allowed its makers to craft a final season that tied up loose ends and bid a proper farewell to its characters. The Vampire Diaries Season 9 Isn\u2019t Likely Star Ian Somerhalder has stated several times he feels The Vampire Diaries chapter of his career is closed and seeing as Nina Dobrev left the show in season 6 and only returned for the finale, it doesn\u2019t seem likely she\u2019d be interested in filming a ninth season. More recently, Somerhalder appeared on Andy Cohen Live and seemed to lay the rumors to rest regarding his and Dobrev's return for a season 9. In his words: 'I have not heard anything about a season nine\u2026I mean, like, what would happen? Stefan and Damon\u2026Damon has, like, gray hair and\u2026they have canes?... Listen, it ran a great course and now it\u2019s still living. That\u2019s what\u2019s so amazing. It\u2019s still living.' ", "For its first six seasons on the The CW television network, The Vampire Diaries featured the love triangle between (the at first human and later vampire) Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) and the blood-thirsty Brothers Salvatore, Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder). To account for Dobrev\u2019s departure at the end of season six, the Elena character was placed in a magical coma that tied her life to that of her best friend, Bonnie Bennett (Kat Graham). When Bonnie dies someday, Elena will awaken, presumably to continue her love affair with Damon. Once he got over Elena, Stefan eventually began a relationship with Elena\u2019s other best friend, Caroline Forbes (Candice King). Since Elena has been unconscious, Damon and Bonnie have grown closer.  The Vampire Diaries also stars Zach Roerig as Matt Donovan, Matthew Davis as Alaric Saltzman, and Michael Malarkey as Lorenzo 'Enzo' St. John.

To account for Dobrev\u2019s departure at the end of season six, the Elena character was placed in a magical coma that tied her life to that of her best friend, Bonnie Bennett (Kat Graham). When Bonnie dies someday, Elena will awaken, presumably to continue her love affair with Damon.

Susan (July 11, 1943) is an American dramatic actress. She is best known for her portrayal of Julie Williams on the NBC drama Days of Our Lives, and her intermittent portrayal of Joanna Manning on the CBS daytime drama The Young and the Restless. She began playing the role of Julie Olsen Williams on Days of Our Lives in 1968, and is the only actor to appear on the show for all seven decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s) in which it has been on the air. Seaforth Hayes still regularly appears on Days as Julie. For her work on Days, Seaforth Hayes has received four Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, in 1975, 1976, 1978, and 1979; and two nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, in 2018, ", "Doug's real identity was orphan Brent Douglas and this helped him form a bond with Julie's mother, Addie Horton Olson (Patricia Barry).

After surviving leukemia, Addie died after being struck by a car pushing Hope's carriage out of the way just in time to save her daughter. Eventually, Julie, who had married and divorced Bob Anderson, reunited and the two of them married in a beautiful ceremony in 1976. Over the next few years, Doug and Julie would face many obstacles including the loss of Doug's Place (formerly Sergio's), Julie's rape and eventual trial for the murder of her rapist, and Julie being disfigured in a fire on Maggie's farm.

Hayes\u2019 career dates back to the earliest days of television in 1949 when he starred on Olsen & Johnson\u2019s 'Fireball Fun-for-All' and later, 'Your Show of Shows.' 'The cameras were huge and immobile back then,' Hayes says. 'They didn\u2019t have the capability of zooming in or out. It was all live until 1958.'

They repeated their actual wedding vows for their inaugural TV ceremony. 'In 1974, Susan and I got married in my living room with 16 people,' Hayes once said. 'In 1976, when Doug and Julie got married, we had 16 million people.' Quite naturally, the televised nuptials came after Doug had married Julie\u2019s mom (Patricia Barry), who would die a tragic death, and had a daughter with her (that would be Julie\u2019s half-sister). He and Seaforth Hayes made history when they became the only soap stars to grace the front of Time magazine.

They spent the next several decades on and off the show since then, with viewers always thrilled to see them return. The couple even made it to Peacock when the show shifted there in September 2022. In a 2011 interview with TV Guide, Seaforth Hayes described her husband \u2014 18 years her senior \u2014 as 'a real lover of life, and he has taught me to have a broader horizon, which I think is probably the key to our still being deliriously happy to see each other 24 hours a day.'

Happy 52nd anniversary Susan! Susan (July 11, 1943) is an American dramatic actress. She is best known for her portrayal of Julie Williams on the NBC drama Days of Our Lives, and her intermittent portrayal of Joanna Manning on the CBS daytime drama The Young and the Restless.

After a fight with Julie over her son, David, Doug went to Addie's and she proposed to him. He accepted and the two of them were married. In 1974 they had a daughter together, Hope. After surviving leukemia, Addie died after being struck by a car pushing Hope's carriage out of the way just in time to save her daughter. Eventually, Julie, who had married and divorced Bob Anderson, reunited and the two of them married in a beautiful ceremony in 1976. Over the next few years, Doug and Julie would face many obstacles including the loss of Doug's Place (formerly Sergio's), Julie's rape and eventual trial for the murder of her rapist, and Julie being disfigured in a fire on Maggie's farm. The latter led her to divorce Doug but the two of them remarried in 1981 after Doug ended his marriage to Lee DuMonde.

Seaforth Hayes, who portrayed the spoiled heiress Julie Olsen Banning Anderson Williams, had joined the show 15 months earlier. The actors married on Oct. 12, 1974, and then their characters wed (for the first of three times!) on an episode that aired Oct. 1, 1976. They repeated their actual wedding vows for their inaugural TV ceremony. 'In 1974, Susan and I got married in my living room with 16 people,' Hayes once said. 'In 1976, when Doug and Julie got married, we had 16 million people.' Quite naturally, the televised nuptials came after Doug had married Julie\u2019s mom (Patricia Barry), who would die a tragic death, and had a daughter with her (that would be Julie\u2019s half-sister). He and Seaforth Hayes made history when they became the only soap stars to grace the front of Time magazine. The cover line on that Jan. 12, 1976, edition: 'Soap Operas: Sex and Suffering in the Afternoon.' Doug and Julie 'went on a cruise' and left the town of Salem as the actors departed Days of Our Lives following a dispute over storylines in 1984. They spent the next several decades on and off the show since then, with viewers always thrilled to see them return. The couple even made it to Peacock when the show shifted there in September 2022. In a 2011 interview with TV Guide, Seaforth Hayes described her husband \u2014 18 years her senior \u2014 as 'a real lover of life, and he has taught me to have a broader horizon, which I think is probably the key to our still being deliriously happy to see each other 24 hours a day.' They received a lifetime achievement award at the Daytime Emmys in April 2018.

According to Andrew Smith, author of Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn, 'Movie theaters wanted nothing to do with popcorn because they were trying to duplicate what was done in real theaters. They had beautiful carpets and rugs and didn't want popcorn being ground into it.' Even if theaters wouldn't offer popcorn, the popcorn came to them. ", "But what about the butter? First of all, movie theaters 'preferred yellow corn, which expanded more when it popped and had a yellowish tint that gave the impression of a coating of butter.' According to PBS, one of the first times butter itself was introduced to popcorn was way back in in 1893 at the World\u2019s Columbian Expo in Chicago, where 'inventor Charles Cretors introduced the world\u2019s first mobile popcorn machine\u2014a simple steam engine attached to a peanut cart that cooked popcorn in a mixture of butter and lard.'

The nation\u2019s largest movie chain, AMC Theaters, pops enough popcorn to fill 222 Olympic-sized swimming pools every year, according to the company. But the perfect (and very profitable) pairing of today wasn\u2019t always the case: For many years, movie theaters wanted nothing to do with the snack. A match made in oil and butter There\u2019s plenty of lore packed in to popcorn\u2019s origin story and a fair bit of drama involved in its 'shotgun wedding' with the movies, according to Andrew F. Smith\u2019s 'Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America.' Smith, in cataloging popcorn\u2019s rise, debunked most of the long-ingrained fables behind the snack.

In the following decades, popcorn vendors proliferated at fairs, circuses and on city streets. More commercial operations emerged, Cracker Jack became a ballpark staple and a slow courtship with the movie exhibition business began. That business, saved by the advent of the 'talkie,' blossomed during the early 20th century. By 1930, a stunning 90 million people were going to the movies on a weekly basis, Smith wrote.

But once competitors started popping up and tales of 'popcorn wealth' spread like wildfire, the concession was brought in-house.

This link between popcorn and movies only grew stronger as the years went by. One large contributor was WWII. Sugar rationing during World War II made candy production more expensive and difficult. Popcorn went by unaffected by the rationing and remained popular. Films continued to grow as a form of media, offering newsreels with footage of the war. By the 1950s, popcorn had become synonymous with going to a movie theater. To this day, popcorn and movies make a powerful duo of flavor and entertainment. It\u2019s a century in the making, but popcorn at the movies is here to stay! ", "Early popcorn probably resembled parched corn, which is made by cooking dried kernels, often in a frying pan. (Because parched corn typically uses kernels with lower water content, curbing its ability to pop, it\u2019s considered a predecessor of CornNuts.) 'Parched corn is much crunchier,' Frank says. 'We know that in the early Southwest, there was popcorn\u2014it just wasn\u2019t a Jiffy Pop that you\u2019d put in your microwave.' The fluffy popcorn we know and love today is, in part, the result of thousands of years of careful cultivation of a few different strains of corn by those early tribes. Modern processing techniques ensure its dramatic cooking process: Corn for popping is grown, cured on the stalk, picked, and then dried until each kernel contains around 14% moisture, according to the USDA. When exposed to heat, that moisture expands, causing the kernel to burst into the final product. (For more on the science of popped corn, see this guide to making the best popcorn at home.) ", "Popcorn has long been popped in pots over a flame, but the turn of the 19th century brought a flurry of popcorn innovation. In 1875, a Kentucky resident named Frederick J. Myers patented a corn-popping device that added a stay-cool handle. But popcorn\u2019s real rise wouldn\u2019t come until sellers could easily carry popping machines around with them. That happened in Chicago in 1885, when Charles Cretors invented a lightweight electric machine that popped corn in oil, allowing vendors to easily move along with crowds in search of a better profit. Eight years later, Cretors improved the model by adding a contraption that would butter and salt the popcorn, too. The first commercial popcorn brands also got their start around the same time, when Iowa\u2019s Albert Dickinson Co., which sold kernels under the names Big Buster and Little Buster, came onto the scene in the 1880s. Photographer Unknown / Library of Congress Subsequent patents provide a glimpse of the popcorn problems inventors sought to solve, both decorative and gustatory. In 1892, James T. Nvoods of Utah applied to patent a machine that coated freshly popped corn in a sugar syrup that would help preserve the snack. The coating separated the kernels so they could be boxed or packaged without getting soggy or dusty. Around then, two brothers began to experiment with new ways to flavor popcorn. Originally from Germany, Frederick and Lewis Rueckheim sold small batches of popcorn they made with a handheld popper. In 1896, they developed a combination that stuck: Cracker Jack, a combination of crunchy popcorn and salty peanuts coated in molasses. The 20th century brought more popcorn patents, each aiming to improve the product or refine the tools of the trade. As the century progressed, individual vendors and commercial entities alike would build on this foundation, using technology to solidify popcorn\u2019s status as a ubiquitous, familiar snack food that could be marketed to the masses. But back then, popcorn vendors relied on crowds at street fairs, festivals, and sporting events for all of their sales. No one expected Hollywood to change popcorn\u2019s course forever.

{"ID": 467, "All Sources": ["Over one thousand different mutant alleles of CFTR have been described. Any mutation that prevents CFTR from sufficiently transporting ions can lead to cystic fibrosis (CF). Worldwide, the most common CFTR allele among CF patients is called \u0394F508 (delta-F508 or PHE508DEL), which is a deletion of three nucleotides that eliminates a phenylalanine (F) from position 508 of the 1480 amino acid wild-type protein. Mutation \u0394F508 causes CFTR to be folded improperly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preventing CFTR from reaching the cell membrane. The allele \u0394F508 accounts for approximately 70% of CF cases in North America, with ~1/25 people of European descent being carriers. The high frequency of the \u0394F508 allele around the world has led to speculation that it may confer some selective advantage to heterozygotes, perhaps by reducing dehydration during cholera epidemics or by reducing susceptibility to certain pathogens that bind to epithelial membranes, although little data has been uncovered to support these hypotheses. However, recent mining of health data and genetic data from over 19,000 CFTR mutant allele heterozygotes suggests that heterozygotes exhibit an increased incidence of a variety of conditions including infertility, pancreatitis, diabetes, short stature, failure to thrive, constipation and scoliosis (Miller et al., 2020). ", "The most common mutation worldwide is delta F508, which occurs in 75% of patients with CF in the UK. A three base-pair deletion in exon 10 of the CFTR gene results in the omission of phenylalanine (one of the bricks) at position 508 in the 1480 amino acid chain. A mutant CFTR protein which cannot be folded into its proper shape is produced. The quality control mechanisms within the cell destroy this abnormal protein before it can reach the cell surface where its major normal function is to act as a channel through which chloride ions can pass in and out of the cell. In other ethnic groups the range of mutations are different e.g. in Ashkenazi Jews delta F508 accounts for 27% and W1282X for 51% of the mutations (Kalman et al, 1994). Mode of inheritance and risk of passing on the CF gene ", "The commonest polymorphism is the seven thymidine (7T) variant and the delta F508 mutation occurs exclusively on the 9T variant. This variation may be important in some CFTR mutations e.g. R117H. The presence of R117H/delta F508 on a background of 5T is associated with an elevated sweat test and clinical CF. R117H in association with 7T may result in normal, borderline or elevated sweat values and a variable clinical presentation (Kiesewetter et al, 1993; Rave-Harel et al, 1997; Massie et al, 2001; Peckham et al, 2006). Genotyping ", "The CFTR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position q31.2 [9]. To date, over 1,900 sequence variations in the CFTR gene have been reported [10], although a detailed understanding of how CFTR mutations impact channel dysfunction is limited to a only a few of these [11]. This implies a relatively small list of well-defined CFTR mutations known to be CF disease causing, whereas the functional consequence of various rare sequence variations remains unknown or has been shown not to be CF disease causing [12]. The majority of identified CFTR gene mutations fall into one of six classes that account for \u223c80% of all CF patients [9]. Of the >1,900 CFTR mutations that have been identified so far, approximately only 20 mutations have a frequency >0.1% [9]. In fact, notwithstanding the common F508del variant, only four CFTR mutations have a frequency >0.1%: G551D, W1282X, G542X and N1303K, having a worldwide prevalence of around 1\u20133% each [9, 11]. F508del is the most common mutation with an allelic frequency of around 90% worldwide [13]. Mutation classification Class I and II CFTR mutations are typically characterised by a reduction in the quantity of expressed CFTR protein (fig. 1). Class I mutations can result from nonsense and frame-shift mutations, as well as mRNA splicing defects [14]. For example, G542X is a nonsense or stop mutation, where introduction of a premature termination codon (or stop codon) results in premature cessation of translation and production of truncated CFTR protein. Class II mutations, including F508del, have folding or maturation defects, which can result in premature CFTR degradation (fig. 1) [9]. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1. ", "The most common mutation causing CF is a three-base pair deletion in the position of delta F508 (dF508), but there are now over 1800 mutations identified in the CFTR gene. The identification of increased immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in the blood of infants with CF has made neonatal screening for CF possible. Trypsinogen is one of the secretory products of the pancreas making its level in the blood a specific marker of pancreatic function. Detection of high levels of IRT in the newborn period place the infant at risk for CF.  Although there is no cure, newborns screened for cystic fibrosis can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment, which can: Improve growth Improve lung function Reduce hospital stays Add years to life ", "The common delta F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interferes with the biosynthetic folding of nascent CFTR polypeptides, leading to their retention and rapid degradation in an intracellular compartment proximal to the Golgi apparatus. Neither the pathway by which wild-type CFTR folds nor the mechanism by which the Phe508 deletion interferes with this process is well understood. We have investigated the effect of glycerol, a polyhydric alcohol known to stabilize protein conformation, on the folding of CFTR and delta F508 in vivo. Incubation of transient and stable delta F508 transfectants with 10% glycerol induced a significant accumulation of delta F508 protein bearing complex N-linked oligosaccharides, indicative of their transit to a compartment distal to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This accumulation was accompanied by an increase in mean whole cell cAMP activated chloride conductance, suggesting that the glycerol-rescued delta F508 polypeptides form functional plasma membrane CFTR channels. These effects were dose- and time-dependent and fully reversible. Glycerol treatment also stabilized immature (core-glycosylated) delta F508 and CFTR molecules that are normally degraded rapidly. These effects of glycerol were not due to a general disruption of ER quality control processes but appeared to correlate with the degree of temperature sensitivity of specific CFTR mutations. These data suggest a model in which glycerol serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and subsequent release from the ER quality control apparatus. ", "Not only is there heterogeneity in the mutations causing Cystic Fibrosis, but the pathogenetic mechanisms also vary. Deletion of phenylalanine-508 appears to cause disease by abrogating normal biosynthetic processing and thereby resulting in retention and degradation of the mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations, such as the relatively common G551D mutation [4], appear to be normally processed and, therefore, must cause disease through some other mechanism. G551D mutation, which is within the first nucleotide-binding fold of the CFTR, is the third most common CF mutation, with a worldwide frequency of 3.1% among CF chromosomes [5]. Several mutations result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced [6]. ", "The most common CF mutation, F508del, is primarily considered to be a processing mutation. The F508del mutation removes a single amino acid from the CFTR protein. Without this building block, the CFTR protein cannot stay in the correct 3-D shape. The cell recognizes that the protein isn't the right shape and disposes of it. The drug combination Trikafta\u00ae (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) works by enabling CFTR protein with an F508del mutation to fold in a more correct shape, and then activates the protein to allow more chloride to pass through. Although this drug combination is not a perfect fix, it helps the mutant CFTR protein to move some chloride. This movement of chloride reduces the symptoms of CF. Watch the webcast (starting at 3:02) to learn more about CF protein processing mutations and how drugs such as CFTR modulators can help a person with one of these mutations. ", "Mutations of the gene encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) lead to CF (Wang et al., 2014). The CFTR protein is a multi-domain integral membrane glycoprotein, which functions as a regulator of chloride and other ion transport across the cell membrane. More than 2,000 CF mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation in CF is the deletion of the phenylalanine residue at position 508 (\u0394F508), which occurs in more than 70% of homozygous CF patients. Accordingly, the majority of research on CF has been focused on \u0394F508.

Mutation classification Class I and II CFTR mutations are typically characterised by a reduction in the quantity of expressed CFTR protein (fig. 1). Class I mutations can result from nonsense and frame-shift mutations, as well as mRNA splicing defects [14]. For example, G542X is a nonsense or stop mutation, where introduction of a premature termination codon (or stop codon) results in premature cessation of translation and production of truncated CFTR protein. Class II mutations, including F508del, have folding or maturation defects, which can result in premature CFTR degradation (fig. 1) [9]. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1.

Neither the pathway by which wild-type CFTR folds nor the mechanism by which the Phe508 deletion interferes with this process is well understood. We have investigated the effect of glycerol, a polyhydric alcohol known to stabilize protein conformation, on the folding of CFTR and delta F508 in vivo. Incubation of transient and stable delta F508 transfectants with 10% glycerol induced a significant accumulation of delta F508 protein bearing complex N-linked oligosaccharides, indicative of their transit to a compartment distal to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This accumulation was accompanied by an increase in mean whole cell cAMP activated chloride conductance, suggesting that the glycerol-rescued delta F508 polypeptides form functional plasma membrane CFTR channels. These effects were dose- and time-dependent and fully reversible. Glycerol treatment also stabilized immature (core-glycosylated) delta F508 and CFTR molecules that are normally degraded rapidly. These effects of glycerol were not due to a general disruption of ER quality control processes but appeared to correlate with the degree of temperature sensitivity of specific CFTR mutations. These data suggest a model in which glycerol serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and subsequent release from the ER quality control apparatus.

Deletion of phenylalanine-508 appears to cause disease by abrogating normal biosynthetic processing and thereby resulting in retention and degradation of the mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations, such as the relatively common G551D mutation [4], appear to be normally processed and, therefore, must cause disease through some other mechanism. G551D mutation, which is within the first nucleotide-binding fold of the CFTR, is the third most common CF mutation, with a worldwide frequency of 3.1% among CF chromosomes [5]. Several mutations result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced [6].

The intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment is the system that includes all fluid enclosed in cells by their plasma membranes. Extracellular fluid (ECF) surrounds all cells in the body. Extracellular fluid has two primary constituents: the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and the interstitial fluid (IF) that surrounds all cells not in the blood. Intracellular Fluid ", "In cell biology, extracellular fluid (ECF) denotes all body fluid outside the cells of any multicellular organism. Total body water in healthy adults is about 50\u201360% (range 45 to 75%) of total body weight; women and the obese typically have a lower percentage than lean men. Extracellular fluid makes up about one-third of body fluid, the remaining two-thirds is intracellular fluid within cells. The main component of the extracellular fluid is the interstitial fluid that surrounds cells. Extracellular fluid is the internal environment of all multicellular animals, and in those animals with a blood circulatory system, a proportion of this fluid is blood plasma. Plasma and interstitial fluid are the two components that make up at least 97% of the ECF. Lymph makes up a small percentage of the interstitial fluid. The remaining small portion of the ECF includes the transcellular fluid (about 2.5%). The ECF can also be seen as having two components \u2013 plasma and lymph as a delivery system, and interstitial fluid for water and solute exchange with the cells. The extracellular fluid, in particular the interstitial fluid, constitutes the body's internal environment that bathes all of the cells in the body. The ECF composition is therefore crucial for their normal functions, and is maintained by a number of homeostatic mechanisms involving negative feedback. Homeostasis regulates, among others, the pH, sodium, potassium, and calcium concentrations in the ECF. The volume of body fluid, blood glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels are also tightly homeostatically maintained. The volume of extracellular fluid in a young adult male of 70 kg (154 lbs) is 20% of body weight \u2013 about fourteen liters. Eleven liters are interstitial fluid and the remaining three liters are plasma. Components The main component of the extracellular fluid (ECF) is the interstitial fluid, or tissue fluid, which surrounds the cells in the body. The other major component of the ECF is the intravascular fluid of the circulatory system called blood plasma. ", "elements are segregated. The two main fluid compartments are the intracellular and extracellular compartments. The intracellular compartment is the space within the organism's cells; it is separated from the extracellular compartment by cell membranes. About two-thirds of the total body water of humans is held in the cells, mostly in the cytosol, and the remainder is found in the extracellular compartment. The extracellular fluids may be divided into three types: interstitial fluid in the 'interstitial compartment' (surrounding tissue cells and bathing them in a solution of nutrients and other chemicals), blood plasma and lymph in the 'intravascular compartment' (inside the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels), and small amounts of transcellular fluid such as ocular and cerebrospinal fluids in the 'transcellular compartment'. ", "Intracellular compartment The intracellular fluid (ICF) is all fluids contained inside the cells, which consists of cytosol and fluid in the cell nucleus. The cytosol is the matrix in which cellular organelles are suspended. The cytosol and organelles together compose the cytoplasm. The cell membranes are the outer barrier. In humans, the intracellular compartment contains on average about 28 liters (6.2 imp gal; 7.4 U.S. gal) of fluid, and under ordinary circumstances remains in osmotic equilibrium. It contains moderate quantities of magnesium and sulfate ions. In the cell nucleus, the fluid component of the nucleoplasm is called the nucleosol. Extracellular compartment The interstitial, intravascular and transcellular compartments comprise the extracellular compartment. Its extracellular fluid (ECF) contains about one-third of total body water. Intravascular compartment ", "The interstitial compartment (also called 'tissue space') surrounds tissue cells. It is filled with interstitial fluid, including lymph. Interstitial fluid provides the immediate microenvironment that allows for movement of ions, proteins and nutrients across the cell barrier. This fluid is not static, but is continually being refreshed by the blood capillaries and recollected by lymphatic capillaries. In the average male (70-kilogram or 150-pound) human body, the interstitial space has approximately 10.5 liters (2.3 imp gal; 2.8 U.S. gal) of fluid. Transcellular compartment ", "While fluid compartments may share some characteristics with the divisions defined by the anatomical compartments of the body, these terms are not one in the same. Fluid compartments are defined by their position relative to the cellular membrane of the cells that make up the body\u2019s tissues. Intracellular Fluid The intracellular fluid of the cytosol or intracellular fluid (or cytoplasm ) is the fluid found inside cells. It is separated into compartments by membranes that encircle the various organelles of the cell. For example, the mitochondrial matrix separates the mitochondrion into compartments. The contents of a eukaryotic cell within the cell membrane, excluding the cell nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles (e.g., mitochondria, plastides, lumen of endoplasmic reticulum, etc.), is referred to as the cytoplasm. The cytosol: The cytosol (11) is the fluid within the plasma membrane of a cell and contains the organelles. The cytosol includes dissolved molecules and water. ", "Body fluids can be discussed in terms of their specific fluid compartment, a location that is largely separate from another compartment by some form of a physical barrier. The intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment is the system that includes all fluid enclosed in cells by their plasma membranes. Extracellular fluid (ECF) surrounds all cells in the body. Extracellular fluid has two primary constituents: the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and the interstitial fluid (IF) that surrounds all cells not in the blood (Figure 26.1.2). Figure 26.1.2 \u2013 Fluid Compartments in the Human Body: The intracellular fluid (ICF) is the fluid within cells. The interstitial fluid (IF) is part of the extracellular fluid (ECF) between the cells. Blood plasma is the second part of the ECF. Materials travel between cells and the plasma in capillaries through the IF. Intracellular Fluid ", "The intracellular fluid compartment refers to the total space inside cells.

The intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment is the system that includes all fluid enclosed in cells by their plasma membranes. Extracellular fluid (ECF) surrounds all cells in the body. Extracellular fluid has two primary constituents: \u001b[92m[1] the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and the interstitial fluid (IF) that surrounds all cells not in the blood\u001b[0m. Intracellular Fluid ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_fluid\nIn cell biology, extracellular fluid (ECF) denotes all body fluid outside the cells of any multicellular organism. Total body water in healthy adults is about 50\u201360% (range 45 to 75%) of total body weight; women and the obese typically have a lower percentage than lean men. Extracellular fluid makes up about one-third of body fluid, the remaining two-thirds is intracellular fluid within cells. The main component of the extracellular fluid is the interstitial fluid that surrounds cells. Extracellular fluid is the internal environment of all multicellular animals, and in those animals with a blood circulatory system, a proportion of this fluid is blood plasma. Plasma and interstitial fluid are the two components that make up at least 97% of the ECF. Lymph makes up a small percentage of the interstitial fluid. The remaining small portion of the ECF includes the transcellular fluid (about 2.5%). The ECF can also be seen as having two components \u2013 plasma and lymph as a delivery system, and interstitial fluid for water and solute exchange with the cells. The extracellular fluid, in particular the interstitial fluid, constitutes the body's internal environment that bathes all of the cells in the body. The ECF composition is therefore crucial for their normal functions, and is maintained by a number of homeostatic mechanisms involving negative feedback. Homeostasis regulates, among others, the pH, sodium, potassium, and calcium concentrations in the ECF. The volume of body fluid, blood glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels are also tightly homeostatically maintained. The volume of extracellular fluid in a young adult male of 70 kg (154 lbs) is 20% of body weight \u2013 about fourteen liters. Eleven liters are interstitial fluid and the remaining three liters are plasma. Components The main component of the extracellular fluid (ECF) is the interstitial fluid, or tissue fluid, which surrounds the cells in the body. The other major component of the ECF is the intravascular fluid of the circulatory system called blood plasma. ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_compartments\nelements are segregated. The two main fluid compartments are the intracellular and extracellular compartments. The intracellular compartment is the space within the organism's cells; it is separated from the extracellular compartment by cell membranes. About two-thirds of the total body water of humans is held in the cells, mostly in the cytosol, and the remainder is found in the extracellular compartment. The extracellular fluids may be divided into three types: interstitial fluid in the 'interstitial compartment' (surrounding tissue cells and bathing them in a solution of nutrients and other chemicals), blood plasma and lymph in the 'intravascular compartment' (inside the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels), and small amounts of transcellular fluid such as ocular and cerebrospinal fluids in the 'transcellular compartment'. ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_compartments\nIntracellular compartment The intracellular fluid (ICF) is all fluids contained inside the cells, which consists of cytosol and fluid in the cell nucleus. The cytosol is the matrix in which cellular organelles are suspended. The cytosol and organelles together compose the cytoplasm. The cell membranes are the outer barrier. In humans, the intracellular compartment contains on average about 28 liters (6.2 imp gal; 7.4 U.S. gal) of fluid, and under ordinary circumstances remains in osmotic equilibrium. It contains moderate quantities of magnesium and sulfate ions. In the cell nucleus, the fluid component of the nucleoplasm is called the nucleosol. Extracellular compartment The interstitial, intravascular and transcellular compartments comprise the extracellular compartment. Its extracellular fluid (ECF) contains about one-third of total body water. Intravascular compartment ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_compartments\nThe interstitial compartment (also called 'tissue space') surrounds tissue cells. It is filled with interstitial fluid, including lymph. Interstitial fluid provides the immediate microenvironment that allows for movement of ions, proteins and nutrients across the cell barrier. This fluid is not static, but is continually being refreshed by the blood capillaries and recollected by lymphatic capillaries. In the average male (70-kilogram or 150-pound) human body, the interstitial space has approximately 10.5 liters (2.3 imp gal; 2.8 U.S. gal) of fluid. Transcellular compartment ", "https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Anatomy_and_Physiology/Anatomy_and_Physiology_(Boundless)/25%3A_Body_Fluids_and_Acid-Base_Balance/25.2%3A_Body_Fluids/25.2B%3A_Fluid_Compartments\nWhile fluid compartments may share some characteristics with the divisions defined by the anatomical compartments of the body, these terms are not one in the same. Fluid compartments are defined by their position relative to the cellular membrane of the cells that make up the body\u2019s tissues. Intracellular Fluid The intracellular fluid of the cytosol or intracellular fluid (or cytoplasm ) is the fluid found inside cells. It is separated into compartments by membranes that encircle the various organelles of the cell. For example, the mitochondrial matrix separates the mitochondrion into compartments. The contents of a eukaryotic cell within the cell membrane, excluding the cell nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles (e.g., mitochondria, plastides, lumen of endoplasmic reticulum, etc.), is referred to as the cytoplasm. The cytosol: The cytosol (11) is the fluid within the plasma membrane of a cell and contains the organelles. The cytosol includes dissolved molecules and water.

The following summer, the National Assembly created a new constitution. While King Louis XVI remained the nominal head of state, the National Assembly held all legislative power. On June 20, 1791, Louis and his family, including his despised Austrian queen, Marie-Antoinette, attempted to flee France and were captured. The newly created Legislative Assembly wanted to spread the revolution across Europe. In April 1792, France declared war on Austria. The war went badly, and Louis XVI was blamed. Accused of treason, he was stripped of his title and imprisoned. In September 1792 a new National Convention declared France a republic and abolished the monarchy. On January 21, 1793, Louis XVI was marched to the guillotine. His severed head was paraded for the gathered thousands and met with cries of 'Vive la Republique!'

The second of three filmed series of Touching Evil, a British-American co-production by United Film and Television Productions and WGBH Boston, continues the saga of D.I. Dave Creegan and his partners D.I. Susan Taylor, and D.C. Mark Rivers, of London\u2019s elite Organized and Serial Crime Unit. ", "The final episodes, also written by Mike Cullen, are intended to send the show off with a bang. The story line intertwines the dangers which Creegan\u2019s professional life poses for his post-divorce family with two cases, a personal vendetta against Creegan and matter of a high-stakes international 'pedophiliac' ring. The common theme is the vulnerability of children, explored to the counterpoint of the most explicit and voluminous violence in the 'Touching Evil' series. Whether agreeing or not that the subject matter and violence contained here is warranted, the viewer will be left with a plate full of food for thought regarding 'cops and robbers' and the complex inner lives of Creegan and company. Related Posts ", "A new season of Touching Evil, starring Robson Green as D.I. Dave Creegan, Nicola Walker as D.I. Susan Taylor, and Shaun Dingwall as D.C. Mark Rivers -- members of London's elite Organized and Serial Crime Unit (OSC). This time out, the OSC loses one of its own to a serial killer who specializes in removing the heart from his victims (Episodes 1 and 2), and Creegan gets burned -- literally -- by a murderer who prefers fire as a means of personal expression (Episodes 3 and 4). 2109 \u2022 Creegan returns from psychiatric sick leave to clear a killer he helped convict. But the local police chief remains convinced the man is guilty -- especially since the murder spree resumes after his release. All victims, to date, are married women with their hearts neatly cut out and left nearby in garbage bags. 2110 \u2022 ", "I enjoyed the premiere episode of Touching Evil (USA, Fridays, 10 p.m. ET) up until the point when Detective David Creegan spits on his prime suspect, Ronald Hinks. After a failed interrogation, Creegan\u2014a federal agent who knows Hinks is a child-murderer but can\u2019t prove it\u2014follows Hinks to his car and jumps into the passenger seat. The detective threatens Hinks and physically intimidates him\u2014pretty standard gritty cop-show fare\u2014and then Creegan crosses the line: He hocks a huge gob at Hinks, who sits there and takes it, hanging his head while spit dribbles past his ear. Creegan acts this way because he is missing part of his frontal lobe, the part of the cerebral cortex involved in impulse control and social appropriateness. 'I have no shame,' he tells his new partner, Detective Susan Branca, in another scene, and though he says it without pride, Creegan\u2019s brain damage is Touching Evil\u2019s badge As if the missing brain parts weren\u2019t enough, Creegan was also pronounced dead for 10 minutes and spent some time in a mental institution\u2014all as a result of a near-fatal gunshot wound we see in the show\u2019s prologue. Because Touching Evil is primarily a drama, these character details carry a lot of weight, but until the spit scene, Creegan\u2019s bizarre and erratic behavior is mostly in good fun. (As the USA Network discovered with its delightful hit Monk, mental problems make for one charming detective.) When we meet Creegan, he\u2019s returning to work at the San Francisco office of the fictional Organized and Serial Crime Unit. He\u2019s better, but not well. Creegan cuts his hair in public, doles out inappropriate bear hugs, makes paper airplanes out of people\u2019s business cards, and generally drives his partner crazy. But he also discovers crucial bits of evidence and displays unfailing crime-solving instincts. As with Monk, only someone who is often so right is allowed to act so wrong. ", "Touching Evil tries to mitigate Creegan\u2019s transgressions by showing us his suffering. He\u2019s divorced and estranged from his family, and he cries at night when he\u2019s alone. To me, this felt like the producers were trying to have it both ways: The cop gets the benefit of the doubt while the criminal gets an eye for an eye. Or perhaps Creegan is the perfect hero for our times: an avenger fueled by rage but hobbled by post-traumatic stress. He has experienced the unthinkable and lived, which the producers seem to think puts him above mortal concerns. Advertisement ", "Touching Evil has always been one of my favorite crime dramas, and a lot of that has to do with the strong performance of lead actor Robson Green. I\u2019ve seen him in a lot before and since, and he really knows how to dig into a character and carry a show. His Creegan is conflicted, certainly with enough to angst about, but Green\u2019s wry wit keeps him from being the brooding hero in the corner. I\u2019ve heard some disparage the performance of Nicola Walker (Spooks/MI-5) as his partner, Susan Taylor, but she\u2019s serviceable for the part and at least is a decent match for him, even if she doesn\u2019t stand out. In all honesty this isn\u2019t really her show; it\u2019s Green\u2019s, and the rest of us are just along for the ride. ", "A shame Nicola Walker was unable to produce an equally good response, she really seemed quite wooden.Unfortunately this episode spoiled the remaining two of this series for me, I still felt as stunned as if the death had been real, an indication of the fine acting I suppose but all in all I would have preferred the series to end with the major characters intact !Well worth buying, but if you haven't seen this series before, you have been warned !!!

", "But if their preferred structures and techniques vary, their approach is largely compatible. Touching Evil is a grim little series, but its grimness is largely what you\u2019d expect. Cops, horrific crimes, the usual psychological focus on what happens to people who spend their time thinking from the perspectives of criminals, namely that they become dark and troubled people full of angst. As I\u2019ve been saying for posts on end, this is absolutely typical of late-millennium television. The paranoia and lurching in the wake of the collapse of the entire historical order of things combined with the looming odometer rollover had us all a little worked up. And so the looming, paranoid darkness of humanity was all the rage. Touching Evil is blatantly a part of this. It\u2019s a reasonably good example, in fact. As are Davies\u2019s other shows of the period. The Grand, for instance, is Davies\u2019s swing at Downton Abbey, only every episode of the first season is unrelentingly depressing. (Davies admits that he was, at the time, confusing drama and tragedy, and credits a friend\u2019s comment on his writing for The Grand for pushing him towards the blended tone that characterizes his later work.) ", "In the U.S. version of the television series Touching evil, there is a song that plays at the beginning of every episode, generally at the beginning of the recap, and it's not the theme song. In the pilot episode, it plays for a couple minutes straight while Creegan is in the house before the man in the ski mask shoots him. It's not on the soundtrack as far as I can tell based on looking up the songs in the track listing, it's not 'A Warm Place' by Nine Inch Nails as the only link I can find regarding the song says it is (which is on the soundtrack), and it isn't from the primary contributing band 12 Rounds, as far as I can tell by listening to all their music on Grooveshark. It's a simple song with a repetitive melody that transitions into something a little more classic. You can listen to the song in this YouTube link. Could someone please help me find this song? It might be a song written and only used specifically in the show, but if it's not, I'd love to have it. Thank you.

{"ID": 80, "All Sources": ["Asthma attacks (worsening of asthma symptoms) can be triggered by allergies, which can temporarily increase the inflammation of the airways in a susceptible person. An allergy is the immune system's reaction when exposed to what is otherwise a harmless substance, such as plant pollen, mold, or animal hair, skin or saliva. The immune system acts as a body defense, yet for people with allergies, the immune system treats these substances, called \"allergens,\" as if they are harmful, causing a disruption to normal body functions. Allergens are what trigger a series of reactions by the immune system during an allergic reaction. Inhaled Allergens. The most important allergens for people with allergic asthma appear to be those asthma triggers that are inhaled. Hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs when a person comes in contact with an allergen or a substance that he or she is sensitive to. Common inhaled allergens include: Animal dander (skin, saliva) Dust mites Cockroach particles Mold Pollen Medical experts recommend that all people with allergies and asthma try to identify possible inhaled allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms. Food Allergies. Food allergies rarely cause asthma yet they can cause a severe life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. The condition can lead to symptoms that include difficulty breathing, wheezing, an itchy rash, low blood pressure, and vomiting. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, walnuts) Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Food preservatives can also trigger allergic and asthmatic reactions. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and may be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods If you suspect that certain foods may be the cause of your asthma, discuss this with your doctor. Allergy skin testing can be done to determine if you are allergic to these foods. If you have allergies and asthma, avoid the substance you are allergic to. Here are some tips to help you avoid some of the most common allergens and prevent asthma attack symptoms. Dust Mites Encase pillows, mattresses, and box springs with allergen-proof, zippered covers. Wash all bedding in hot water once a week. Non-carpeted flooring is best. If you cannot get rid of your carpeting, vacuum often with an HEPA filter. Wear a mask while vacuuming. If your child has asthma, do not vacuum while he or she is in the room. Products that eliminate dust mites from carpeting (such as Acarosan) can be purchased. Your asthma care provider can give you information about these products. Avoid curtains and drapes. Use plain window shades instead of mini-blinds. Washable curtains should be washed in hot water every two to four weeks. Dust all surfaces with a damp cloth often, including lampshades and windowsills. Keep clutter under control. Toys and books should be stored in enclosed bookshelves, drawers or closets. Replace traditional stuffed animals with washable stuffed animals. Keep all clothing in drawers and closets. Keep drawers and closets closed. Cover air ducts with filters. Change these when soiled. Pillows and bedding should not contain feathers. Keep indoor humidity low (below 50%). Use a dehumidifier if needed. Regularly change filters on heaters and air conditioners. Mold and Mildew Air out damp, humid areas frequently. Run a dehumidifier to keep humidity between 35% and 45%. Use air conditioners when possible. Clean bathrooms regularly using products that kill and prevent mold. Use exhaust fans to vent steam. Do not carpet the bathroom. Keep indoor plants out of bedrooms. When painting, add mold inhibitor to paint to prevent mold from growing. Avoid sources of outdoor molds, such as wet leaves or garden debris. To clean visible mold use a cleaning solution containing bleach ( one ounce per quart of water). Insects Many homes and apartments have cockroaches and other insects. Some people with asthma are allergic to a protein in their droppings. To control these allergens in your home: Use roach baits or traps. Insect sprays can be used, but should only be sprayed when no one is at home. Before you or your child returns home after spraying, make sure that your home has been aired out for a couple of hours. Because cockroaches thrive in high humid environment, fix water leaks in and around your home. Cover food in lidded or sealed containers. Clean dishes after eating. Sweep floors after you have eaten. Pollen Pollen is a tiny egg shaped cell from flowering plants. Pollens are difficult to avoid because they cannot be eliminated from the atmosphere. Plants have different periods of pollination, which varies little from year to year. Yet, the type of weather affects the amount of pollen in the air with hot, dry, and windy weather causing more pollen in the air. In general pollen season starts from February to October. You can lessen your or your child's exposure to pollen by: Limiting your or your child's outdoor activities during times of high pollen, such as early morning. Having him wear a hat outdoors, washing his hands and face when he comes inside, and having him change his clothes after being outside. Staying indoors during dry or windy days when pollen counts are high. Keeping windows closed during pollen seasons. Using air conditioning if possible. Pet Dander It is best not to own any pets if you or your child is highly allergic to pet dander. Long visits to friends and family who own pets should be avoided. If you do visit, make sure you or your child takes asthma or allergy medicines before the visit. Exposure to the pets should be kept to a minimum when visiting. If you must have a cat or dog in the home, restrict its living area. It should not be allowed in your or your child's bedroom at any time. If possible, keep the pet outside. Wash your pet weekly. Remove as much carpeting as possible. Animal dander deposits in the carpet and stays there, even after the pet is gone from the home. Food Allergies If you have allergies, avoiding food triggers can be challenging. It is important to always read food labels and, when dining out, ask how foods are prepared. Consider Allergy Shots You can train your immune system to not overreact to allergy triggers. Doctors do this by giving you allergy shots (immunotherapy) for asthma. An allergy shot is a small amount of the substance that causes your allergy. By giving repeated shots of the substance over a period of time, your immune system eventually stops causing the allergic reaction. Ask your doctor if you are a candidate for allergy shots for preventing asthma."], "All URLs": ["https://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/allergies-asthma"], "All Sources (cited)": ["https://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/allergies-asthma\nAsthma attacks (worsening of asthma symptoms) can be \u001b[92m[5] triggered by allergies\u001b[0m, which \u001b[92m[6] can temporarily increase the inflammation of the airways in a susceptible person\u001b[0m.

The most important allergens for people with allergic asthma appear to be those asthma triggers that are inhaled. Hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs when a person comes in contact with an allergen or a substance that he or she is sensitive to. Common inhaled allergens include: Animal dander (skin, saliva) Dust mites Cockroach particles Mold Pollen Medical experts recommend that all people with allergies and asthma try to identify possible inhaled allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms. Food Allergies. Food allergies rarely cause asthma yet they can cause a severe life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. The condition can lead to symptoms that include difficulty breathing, wheezing, an itchy rash, low blood pressure, and vomiting. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, walnuts) Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Food preservatives can also trigger allergic and asthmatic reactions. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and may be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods If you suspect that certain foods may be the cause of your asthma, discuss this with your doctor. Allergy skin testing can be done to determine if you are allergic to these foods. If you have allergies and asthma, avoid the substance you are allergic to. Here are some tips to help you avoid some of the most common allergens and prevent asthma attack symptoms. Dust Mites Encase pillows, mattresses, and box springs with allergen-proof, zippered covers. Wash all bedding in hot water once a week. Non-carpeted flooring is best. If you cannot get rid of your carpeting, vacuum often with an HEPA filter. Wear a mask while vacuuming. If your child has asthma, do not vacuum while he or she is in the room. Products that eliminate dust mites from carpeting (such as Acarosan) can be purchased. Your asthma care provider can give you information about these products. Avoid curtains and drapes. Use plain window shades instead of mini-blinds. Washable curtains should be washed in hot water every two to four weeks. Dust all surfaces with a damp cloth often, including lampshades and windowsills. Keep clutter under control. Toys and books should be stored in enclosed bookshelves, drawers or closets. Replace traditional stuffed animals with washable stuffed animals. Keep all clothing in drawers and closets. Keep drawers and closets closed. Cover air ducts with filters. Change these when soiled. Pillows and bedding should not contain feathers. Keep indoor humidity low (below 50%). Use a dehumidifier if needed. Regularly change filters on heaters and air conditioners. Mold and Mildew Air out damp, humid areas frequently. Run a dehumidifier to keep humidity between 35% and 45%. Use air conditioners when possible. Clean bathrooms regularly using products that kill and prevent mold. Use exhaust fans to vent steam. Do not carpet the bathroom. Keep indoor plants out of bedrooms. When painting, add mold inhibitor to paint to prevent mold from growing. Avoid sources of outdoor molds, such as wet leaves or garden debris. To clean visible mold use a cleaning solution containing bleach ( one ounce per quart of water). Insects Many homes and apartments have cockroaches and other insects. Some people with asthma are allergic to a protein in their droppings. To control these allergens in your home: Use roach baits or traps. Insect sprays can be used, but should only be sprayed when no one is at home. Before you or your child returns home after spraying, make sure that your home has been aired out for a couple of hours. Because cockroaches thrive in high humid environment, fix water leaks in and around your home. Cover food in lidded or sealed containers. Clean dishes after eating. Sweep floors after you have eaten. Pollen Pollen is a tiny egg shaped cell from flowering plants. Pollens are difficult to avoid because they cannot be eliminated from the atmosphere. Plants have different periods of pollination, which varies little from year to year. Yet, the type of weather affects the amount of pollen in the air with hot, dry, and windy weather causing more pollen in the air. In general pollen season starts from February to October. You can lessen your or your child's exposure to pollen by: Limiting your or your child's outdoor activities during times of high pollen, such as early morning. Having him wear a hat outdoors, washing his hands and face when he comes inside, and having him change his clothes after being outside. Staying indoors during dry or windy days when pollen counts are high. Keeping windows closed during pollen seasons. Using air conditioning if possible. Pet Dander It is best not to own any pets if you or your child is highly allergic to pet dander. Long visits to friends and family who own pets should be avoided. If you do visit, make sure you or your child takes asthma or allergy medicines before the visit. Exposure to the pets should be kept to a minimum when visiting. If you must have a cat or dog in the home, restrict its living area. It should not be allowed in your or your child's bedroom at any time. If possible, keep the pet outside. Wash your pet weekly. Remove as much carpeting as possible. Animal dander deposits in the carpet and stays there, even after the pet is gone from the home. Food Allergies If you have allergies, avoiding food triggers can be challenging. It is important to always read food labels and, when dining out, ask how foods are prepared. Consider Allergy Shots You can \u001b[92m[3] train your immune system to not overreact to allergy triggers\u001b[0m.
