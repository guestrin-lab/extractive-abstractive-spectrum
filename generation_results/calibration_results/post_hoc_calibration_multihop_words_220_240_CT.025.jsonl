Of course, whether you and I are aware of this, language has already invited us into this fantasy of symmetry: we are thinking of the anti-arctic, that which is opposite 'the bear,' i.e., Ursa Major, the prominent constellation of the northern celestial sphere; we are thinking, too, thus, of the arctic, from the Greek arktos, 'bear' and, via the magic of metonymy, 'north,' from which the more familiar Latin ursus comes. But would we know how to look at the Arctic, either?

Her sophomore studio album Breakaway, released in 2004, won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album and was nominated for an American Music Award and a Juno Award. Its lead single 'Since U Been Gone' won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and two MTV Video Music Awards, while its follow-up single 'Because of You' also won an MTV Video Music Award and was bestowed by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for its Pop Song of the Year award.\n", "Clarkson began promoting 'Already Gone' on television by debuting it on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 13, in a live performance in which she 'belted out' the lyrics to the reworked arrangement.

Billboard likened Clarkson's 'ghostly delivery' to that of Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine said that 'Ryan Tedder's production on 'Already Gone' is identical to Beyonc\u00e9's 'Halo' to the point of distraction, but [Already Gone] has a far stronger melody and Clarkson turns in one of her most evocative performances'. Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel wrote that the lyrics are not unique or enlightening, and Tedder's production on the track was disliked. Jon Caramanica from The New York Times thought that Tedder 'drowns [Clarkson] under murky piano on 'Already Gone'.'\n", "Despite her dissatisfaction with the song's release as a single, Clarkson began promoting it in July 2009, performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards. She included 'Already Gone' in the encore set of her 2009 All I Ever Wanted Tour. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is regarded as one of the highlights of All I Ever Wanted. Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number\u00a013 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.\nWriting and composition\n'Already Gone'\nA 26-second sample of the bridge and chorus of 'Already Gone', highlighting the musical composition, and Clarkson's vocals which span from B3 to E5.\nProblems playing this file?

", "'Already Gone' is a song performed by American pop singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson from her fourth studio album, 'All I Ever Wanted'. It is co-written by Clarkson and Ryan Tedder, who also produced it. The song was released as the album's third single in August 2009. Lyrically, 'Already Gone' is about the breakup of a relationship; the music consists of an arrangement using a piano, drums, and string instruments. The production and release of 'Already Gone' have been surrounded in controversy. Clarkson claimed that Tedder re-used the musical arrangement on the 2009 Beyonc\u00e9 song 'Halo', and stated that the public would incorrectly assume that she had stolen it; Tedder declared the accusations hurtful and false. After failing to prevent the song from being included on 'All I Ever Wanted' because the track listing had already been finalized and the album was already being pressed, Clarkson then voiced her anger towards her record company bosses for subsequently deciding to release it as a single. The accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who complained that he was not allowed to fully realize his vision, and stated he was unhappy with the final result. It features scenes of Clarkson dressed in a gold gown and expensive jewelry while lying on a chaise longue in an apartment. Shots of floating objects intersperse a second scene in which Clarkson, wearing a black dress, sings in a rehearsal room while surrounded by the instruments of an invisible orchestra. Despite her dissatisfaction with the song's release as a single, Clarkson began promoting it in July 2009, performing it live on the 'Late Show with David Letterman' and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on 'VH1 Divas' and at the American Music Awards. She included 'Already Gone' in the encore set of her 2009 'All I Ever Wanted Tour'. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is regarded as one of the highlights of 'All I Ever Wanted'. Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number 13 on the 'Billboard' Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.

Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine said that 'Ryan Tedder's production on 'Already Gone' is identical to Beyonc\u00e9's 'Halo' to the point of distraction, but [Already Gone] has a far stronger melody and Clarkson turns in one of her most evocative performances'.

In the early 1950s, he partnered with engineer Edgar Vilchur, his former teacher, to form Acoustic Research. They developed a revolutionary product, the AR-1. Sized for a bookshelf, it was an 'acoustic suspension' speaker whose quality challenged the conventional wisdom that rich bass tones required large cones and magnets and giant boxes.\nHis next venture, in the 1960s, was KLH, a company he formed with two partners that reimagined the radio. KLH\u2019s Model 8 FM radio had high selectivity, meaning it could grab stations otherwise lost in a crowded dial. KLH also created some of the original audio devices to use transistors. Kloss then founded another company, Advent, where he designed premium-quality loudspeakers and sold the first cassette player to use Dolby B noise reduction.\n", "KLH AudioFormerlyKLH Research and Development Corporation; KLH Audio SystemsIndustryAudio electronicsFounded1957; 67\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1957) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.FoundersHenry KlossMalcolm S.

It was set at a warehouse, noted to be visually darker than Trainor's previous clips and featured her dancing alongside an all-female dance troupe.

Bohdziewicz was born in the city of Vilna (modern Vilnius), then part of the Russian Empire. In 1928, he graduated from the Technical Faculty of the Warsaw University of Technology and was simultaneously studying at the Faculty of Humanities of the Stefan Batory University. In 1928, he became a speaker at the newly established branch of the Polish Radio in his native city. In 1931 however he obtained a state scholarship and left for France. In Paris he joined the prestigious 'Ecole Technique de Photographie et de Cin\u00e9matographie', where he also made his first documentaries. In 1935, he returned to Poland and worked as a journalist and cameraman for the state-owned Polska Agencja Telegraficzna Film Chronicle (PAT), the most popular newsreel in Poland. He also worked as a journalist and columnist for the 'Pion' weekly. In late 1930s he made numerous documentaries for the PAT agency, as well as for the SAF film studio. In 1939, he began working on his first feature film 'Zazdro\u015b\u0107 i medycyna', based on a novel by Micha\u0142 Choroma\u0144ski. However, the shooting was interrupted by the outbreak of the Invasion of Poland (1939). During World War II he was an active member of the Home Army and collaborated with the Bureau of Information and Propaganda as the head of the photo and film department. In 1943, he also started a 'Tres' photographic studio in Warsaw, which became a clandestine outpost of the Home Army. During the Warsaw Uprising he became the head of the group of cameramen to prepare daily newsreels and was one of the people to prepare 'Warszawa walczy', a documentary filmed and shown entirely in besieged Warsaw. After the war he continued his career in the same role and became one of the first members of the Polish Film Chronicle (PKF) company. Working in Krak\u00f3w, already in March 1945 he started a Film Atelier for the Youth, the first film school to be opened in Poland after the end of the German occupation. In December of that year he converted his atelier into a regular study, which became a direct predecessor of the Krak\u00f3w Film School. In 1948 he moved to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where he became the chairman of the Department of Direction of the National Film School. In that role he became a teacher of several generations of Polish film directors. He also remained an active director himself. His first film, '2 *2=4', was released already in 1945 and was among the first feature films to be shot in Poland after World War II. Between 1956 and 1962 Bohdziewicz served as an artistic director of the 'Droga Film Team' and then the TOR Film Studio (1968\u20131970). Simultaneously he was also a teacher at the Brussels-based 'Institut National Sup\u00e9rieur des Arts du Spectacle'. He died October 20, 1970 in Warsaw.

A legitimist sympathiser Jules Laborde fathered Une vengeance carliste (1927), set during the Third Carlist War. In Nazi Germany Johannes Reinwaldt released a novel Der K\u00f6nigsthron (1937), set during the First Carlist War. Carlist themes featured also in third-rate sensational prose, e.g. Don Jaime was a protagonist of Pi\u0119tno przekle\u0144stwa (1924), a novel in Polish by a Russian author Nikolay Breshko-Breshkovsky. Distant Carlist echoes reverberate in II figlio del pastore (1930) by Lorenzo Viani, a novel based on infant recollections of the author from Viareggio.\n", "\u001b[92m[1] Fernando Ezequiel' Pino' Solanas( born 16 February 1936) is an Argentine film director, screenwriter and politician.\u001b[0m His films include' La hora de los hornos( The Hour of the Furnaces)'( 1968),' Tangos: el exilio de Gardel'( 1985),' Sur'( 1988),' El viaje'( 1992),' La nube'( 1998) and' Memoria del saqueo'( 2004), among many others. Since 2013, he has been a National Senator representing the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Solanas studied theatre, music and law. In 1962, he directed his first short feature' Seguir andando' and in 1968 he covertly produced and directed his first long feature film' La Hora de los Hornos', a documentary on neo-colonialism and violence in Latin America. The film won several international awards and was screened around the world. \u001b[92m[7] Solanas has won the Grand Jury Prize and the Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival and the' Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne' at the Cannes Film Festival.\u001b[0m In 1999 he was the President of the Jury at the 21st Moscow International Film Festival.

In 1928, he became a speaker at the newly established branch of the Polish Radio in his native city. In 1931 however he obtained a state scholarship and left for France. In Paris he joined the prestigious 'Ecole Technique de Photographie et de Cin\u00e9matographie', where he also made his first documentaries. In 1935, he returned to Poland and worked as a journalist and cameraman for the state-owned Polska Agencja Telegraficzna Film Chronicle (PAT), the most popular newsreel in Poland. He also worked as a journalist and columnist for the 'Pion' weekly. In late 1930s he made numerous documentaries for the PAT agency, as well as for the SAF film studio. In 1939, he began working on his first feature film 'Zazdro\u015b\u0107 i medycyna', based on a novel by Micha\u0142 Choroma\u0144ski. However, the shooting was interrupted by the outbreak of the Invasion of Poland (1939). During World War II he was an active member of the Home Army and collaborated with the Bureau of Information and Propaganda as the head of the photo and film department. In 1943, he also started a 'Tres' photographic studio in Warsaw, which became a clandestine outpost of the Home Army. During the Warsaw Uprising he became the head of the group of cameramen to prepare daily newsreels and was one of the people to prepare 'Warszawa walczy', a documentary filmed and shown entirely in besieged Warsaw. After the war he continued his career in the same role and became one of the first members of the Polish Film Chronicle (PKF) company. Working in Krak\u00f3w, already in March 1945 he started a Film Atelier for the Youth, the first film school to be opened in Poland after the end of the German occupation. In December of that year he converted his atelier into a regular study, which became a direct predecessor of the Krak\u00f3w Film School.

The Living Dead Girl (French: La Morte Vivante) is a 1982 campy classic from French fantastique director Jean Rollin. Reanimated by the spillage of a toxic waste goop on her corpse, the aristocratic Catherine discovers she has a new-found taste for human flesh.\u00a0Like all of Rollin\u2019s films, the aesthetics play a much more crucial role than the story or, indeed, the acting. His films are as gorgeous as they are completely ridiculous. The absurd plot devices \u2014 toxic goop dumped on (surprisingly well-preserved, two-year-old) corpse interred in family crypt \u2014 exist only to furnish Rollin with an excuse to create his signature erotic-grotesque imagery. Rollin\u2019s The Living Dead Girl is splatter gore-meets-arthouse, served up with a little Jean-Paul Sartre on the side.

Born at Ey\u00fcp Palace, Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), on 8 February 1830, Abd\u00fclaziz received an Ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the West. He was the first Ottoman Sultan who travelled to Western Europe, visiting a number of important European capitals including Paris, London and Vienna in the summer of 1867. Apart from his passion for the Ottoman Navy, which had the world's third largest fleet in 1875 (after the British and French navies), the Sultan took an interest in documenting the Ottoman Empire. He was also interested in literature and was a talented classical music composer. Some of his compositions, together with those of the other members of the Ottoman dynasty, have been collected in the album 'European Music at the Ottoman Court' by the London Academy of Ottoman Court Music. He was deposed on grounds of mismanaging the Ottoman economy on 30 May 1876, and was found dead six days later under unnatural and mysterious circumstances.

The song, making an appearance on the band's 1975 album 'Soap Opera', was written by Ray Davies, the band's main songwriter. ", "The Kinks are an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1964 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965 (as a result of constant fighting between the brothers). Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned 'You Really Got Me', became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, American rock and roll, British music hall, folk, and country. They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' wittily observational writing style, and are considered one of the most influential groups of the period. Early works included albums such as 'Face to Face' (1966), 'Something Else' (1967), 'The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society' (1968), 'Arthur' (1969), 'Lola Versus Powerman' (1970), and 'Muswell Hillbillies' (1971), along with their accompanying singles. After a fallow period in the mid-1970s, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with their albums 'Sleepwalker' (1977), 'Misfits' (1978), 'Low Budget' (1979), 'Give the People What They Want' (1981) and 'State of Confusion' (1983). In addition, groups such as Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders and the Fall covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence. Ray Davies (rhythm guitar, lead vocals, keyboards) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the band's 32-year run. Longest-serving member Mick Avory (drums and percussion) was replaced by Bob Henrit, formerly of Argent, in 1984. Original bass guitarist Pete Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969, and Dalton was in turn replaced by Argent bassist Jim Rodford in 1978. Session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings in the mid-to-late 1960s. In 1969 the band became an official five-piece when keyboardist John Gosling joined them, being replaced by Ian Gibbons in 1979, who remained in the band until they broke up in 1996 as a result of the commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers. The Kinks have had five Top 10 singles on the US 'Billboard' chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, The Kinks have had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four of their albums have been certified gold by the RIAA and the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for 'Outstanding Service to British Music'. In 1990, the original four members of The Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005.

A proponent of enlightened absolutism, he succeeded to the Spanish throne on 10 August 1759, upon the death of his half-brother Ferdinand VI, who left no heirs. In 1731, the 15-year-old Charles became the Duke of Parma and Piacenza, as Charles I, following the death of his childless grand-uncle Antonio Farnese. In 1738 he married Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony, daughter of Augustus III of Poland and an educated, cultured woman who gave birth to 13 children, eight of whom reached adulthood. Charles and Maria Amalia resided in Naples for 19 years. As King of Spain, Charles III made far-reaching reforms such as promoting science and university research, facilitating trade and commerce, and modernising agriculture. He also tried to reduce the influence of the Church and strengthen the Spanish army and navy. His previous experience as King of Naples and Sicily proved valuable.

{"ID": 268, "All Sources": ["Jack London's novel has inspired at least nine film versions with the first one, produced in 1913, remaining the most faithful to the book. Other renditions include the 1920 version with Noah Beery in the Wolf Larsen role, a 1926 version starring Ralph Ince, a 1930 remake featuring Milton Sills, a version entitled Barricade (1950) with Raymond Massey, Wolf Larsen (1958), a pet project of actor Sterling Hayden which starred Barry Sullivan, Larsen: Wolf of the Seven Seas (1975), an Italian production with Chuck Connors in the title role, and a made-for-TV version in 1993 starring Charles Bronson. But by general consensus, the 1941 production of The Sea Wolf, directed by Michael Curtiz, is considered the most effective adaptation due to Edward G. Robinson's definitive portrayal and Robert Rossen's screenplay which accents the psychological and allegorical aspects of the story.\n", "While the 1941 version of The Sea Wolf remained faithful in spirit to the London novel, screenwriter Robert Rossen, who was a fervent anti-Fascist, drew upon current events to establish an obvious parallel between Larsen's dictatorial nature and that of a contemporary fanatic like Hitler. He also made several important changes in the storyline; he split the narrative, giving equal time to the battle of wills between Larsen and Van Weyden (Alexander Knox) and the growing romance between Leach and Ruth Webster (Ida Lupino). In addition, he altered the climax which provided a new demise for Larsen and an unexpected fate for Van Weyden.

The alternate editing thus links the world of the illegal aliens with that of the meat packing plant, and the very use of this type of editing helps the viewer understand Linklater\u2019s intent: to show that in some sectors of the neoliberal economy those two worlds are inextricable.\n", "\u001b[92m[1] Jonathan Favreau( born October 19, 1966) is an American actor, director, producer, and screenwriter.\u001b[0m Favreau has starred in the films' Rudy'( 1993),' Swingers'( 1996, which he also wrote),' Very Bad Things'( 1998),' The Replacements'( 2000),' Daredevil'( 2003),' The Break- Up'( 2006),' Couples Retreat'( 2009), and' Chef'( 2014), which he also wrote and directed.

He is widely considered one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema, and one of Russia's most influential filmmakers. His films explored spiritual and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature and memory. Tarkovsky studied film at Moscow's State Institute of Cinematography under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, and subsequently directed his first five feature films in the Soviet Union: 'Ivan's Childhood' (1962), 'Andrei Rublev' (1966), 'Solaris' (1972), 'Mirror' (1975), and 'Stalker' (1979). After years of creative conflict with Soviet authorities, Tarkovsky left the country in 1979 and made his final two films abroad; 'Nostalghia' (1983) and 'The Sacrifice' (1986) were produced in Italy and Sweden respectively. In 1986, he also published a book about cinema and art entitled 'Sculpting in Time'. He died of cancer later that year.

He is widely considered one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema, and one of Russia's most influential filmmakers. His films explored spiritual and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature and memory. Tarkovsky studied film at Moscow's State Institute of Cinematography under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, and subsequently directed his first five feature films in the Soviet Union: 'Ivan's Childhood' (1962), 'Andrei Rublev' (1966), 'Solaris' (1972), 'Mirror' (1975), and 'Stalker' (1979). After years of creative conflict with Soviet authorities, Tarkovsky left the country in 1979 and made his final two films abroad; 'Nostalghia' (1983) and 'The Sacrifice' (1986) were produced in Italy and Sweden respectively. In 1986, he also published a book about cinema and art entitled 'Sculpting in Time'. He died of cancer later that year.

", "Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 \u2013 August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the 'King of Rock and Roll' or simply 'the King'. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

He followed William Moir Calder( 1880 \u2013 1960) as Hulme Professor of Greek at Manchester University, a position he held 1931 \u2013 48, when he was followed by H. D.( Henry) Westlake( 1906 \u2013 92). He then was Professor of Greek at University College London 1948 \u2013 68 and in 1953 established the Institute of Classical Studies. During World War II he served as an officer in the military intelligence. After his wife, the Classicist A. M. Dale, died in 1967, he moved to Stanford University as professor of classics and as an emeritus. In honour of his work, a street in the Acropolis district of Athens has been renamed to Webster Street( transliterated Gouemster on some signs and maps).

That\u00a0Sunrise is still being praised by critics, however, speaks to the lasting artistic merits of the film and its impact on the development of the language of film.\u00a0 Cited at the first Academy Awards as the 'Best Unique and Artistic Achievement' in film, among 3 total awards, Sunrise was also overshadowed by Wings, which won the 'Best Picture' award, the only time 2 films were honored as the 'best' in any single year.\u00a0 That Sunrise was made at all, let alone in the manner in which it was made, can be directly linked to two men\u2019s creativity, ingenuity and determination to elevate the artistic nature of film.\u00a0 It also reflects a moment in time when both men, director F.W. Murnau and Fox Film Company head William Fox, reached for the pinnacle of their fields, only to be shatteringly brought back to earth, by poor decisions, bad timing and poor luck. Within four years of the film\u2019s release, one man would be dead and the other near bankrupt.\n", "George O\u2019Brien and Janet Gaynor starred in Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (also known as Sunrise), the 1927 silent romantic drama directed by German director F. W. Murnau (in his American film debut) that also features Margaret Livingston. (Auburn Cinefile Collection)\nSunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927). (IMDb.com)\n'Sunrise,' starring George O'Brien, Janet Gaynor, and Margaret Livingston, was released on September 23, 1927. Available from 20th Century Fox Studio Classics.\n", "While both William Fox and FW Murnau have been largely forgotten outside of film studies courses, their legacy of creating a unique and endearing piece of cinematic art cannot be understated.\u00a0 Without the drive of Fox to elevate his company artistically and Murnau\u2019s talent and perfectionism, Sunrise would never have been made.\u00a0 Murnau\u2019s genius took a simple story of betrayal and love and crafted a masterwork of style, emotion and wonder.\u00a0 Enjoying the five more than 95 years after its release is testament to its enduring quality and place among the greatest achievements in the quintessential artform of the 20th century.\u00a0*A final footnote.\u00a0 While William Fox was one of the early pioneers in archiving film as an artistic endeavor, even approaching congress for money for a national film archive, more than 90% of Fox Studios silent films were completely lost in a 1937 fire at their New Jersey warehouse, including Sunrise.\u00a0 As late as 2003 archivists from around the world were able to combine multiple pieces of existing materials to restore Sunrise to its glorious current state.\u00a0 2oth Century Fox, the company created in 1936 out of the near bankrupt ruins of William Fox\u2019s empire, partnered with the British Film Institute to restore the film for future generations.\n", "The film was not a success at the box office, however. It was overshadowed by The Jazz Singer, the first talkie, released only two weeks later. Sunrise used the Movietone system with sound recorded optically on the film itself. Sunrise only included music and sound effects, while the Warner Bros.\u2019s Jazz Singer included a couple of spoken dialogues. Sunrise, however, remains one of the high points of silent films, combining American-style storytelling with visual effects mostly seen (until then) in European films. Today it is considered one of the greatest films ever made.By January 1928 Fox had filmed ten vaudeville shorts and a part-talkie feature, Blossom Time. During the spring of 1928, these efforts, along with Fox's newsreels and Warners\u2019 shorts and part-talkies, proved to be the hits of the season. Thus, in May 1928 William Fox declared that 100 percent of the upcoming production schedule would be Movietone. Simultaneously Fox Film continued to wire, as quickly as possible, all the houses in its ever-expanding chain, and draw up plans for an all-sound Hollywood-based studio. Fox's innovation of sound neared completion; colossal profits loomed on the horizon. William Fox\u2019s vision and Theodore Case\u2019s tenacity and inventions changed the movie landscape forever. The ripple effect of their collaboration is still evident close to 100 years later.\n", "This audio-visual pun on the two sounds (and yes, there\u2019s a pun in audio-visual there) is perfectly timed and handled. The crash, and by extension the intertitle, interrupt George\u2019s suicide and thus save his life. Similarly, the audience, close to seeing their hero make such a grave and irreversible error, have the tension relieved with a wonderful gag that makes full use of the film\u2019s potential as a silent movie. It is a gag worthy of Chaplin himself.\n6. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) \u2013 The animation station\n", "After Sunrise Fox and his executives curtailed Murnau\u2019s freedom and he made 2 more films for the company, both of which were significantly altered from his version, with Four Devils now lost.\u00a0 After exiting his Fox contract, the director went to the South Pacific to work with renowned documentarian Robert Flaherty to direct Tabu, which secured distribution through Paramount for a US release.\u00a0 A week before its March 18h, 1931 premiere Murnau died after injuries sustained in a car accident.\u00a0 He was 42 years old.William Fox was able to overcome the financial setback of Sunrise and continued to push his innovative sound on film technology, as well as building and expanding his distribution network.\u00a0 By 1929 his empire was worth an estimated $300 million dollars and he had enough power to have a deal in place to buy all of the assets of Loews, the parent company of MGM Studios and all their associated theaters. He was at the mountain top of his industry, but it was short lived.\u00a0 A July 1929 automobile accident left him hospitalized and near death.\u00a0 As events of that fall began to take hold, it became apparent he had overextended himself financially and when banks called in his notes after the October Stock Market crash, Fox, still in his hospital bed, was left near penniless.\u00a0 He lost the MGM deal and in 1930 was forced to sell his empire for a mere $15 million dollars.\u00a0 He never made another film and by 1941 was actually sentenced to prison for bribing a judge, sealing his fate on the dustbin of history.\n", "When Murnau finally arrived in New York in July of 1926, he was feted by Fox, who promptly offered the director a four-year contract extension, with a salary elevating to $200,000 in the final year.\u00a0 The director agreed and headed off to California to scout for locations for the rural opening sequence of the film.\u00a0 In what would be a harbinger of things to come, Murnau decided that Lake Arrowhead would be the perfect setting for the country home of the farmer and his wife, but insisted that a small town be constructed across the lake from the already existing community.\u00a0 A robust $750,000 budget was assigned to the film and Fox granted Murnau complete freedom to cast whom he wanted and gave him access to the very best technicians on the Fox lot.At the time of her casting Janet Gaynor was a 20-year-old ing\u00e9nue with just four credited roles to her name, but already she was the top actress on the Fox lot.\u00a0 In films like The Johnstown Flood, The Shamrock Handicap and Midnight Kiss, all made in 1926, she had established herself as one of Hollywood\u2019s leading ladies.\u00a0 George O\u2019Brien, who would be cast as her husband, had been plucked from stuntman obscurity to star in John Ford\u2019s The Iron Horse in 1924 and quickly established his box office appeal in four subsequent Ford films.\u00a0 Both actors relied on more naturalistic acting styles that were evolving as silent film matured, with Gaynor endearing herself playing sweet innocent damsels and O\u2019Brien as a rugged, but sensitive tough guy.\u00a0 They were both perfect for Murnau, who liked his actors to convey feelings and actions without dramatic pantomime.Once photography began at the Lake Arrowhead location everyone involved realized this would be unlike any film they had worked on before.\u00a0 Murnau\u2019s attention to detail was unique among directors, particularly directors used to working in the Hollywood system of burn and turn camera takes.\u00a0 Instead, Murnau would often engage in as many as 20-30 takes of a single shot, sometimes waiting for light to reflect off a background object to capture the mood he wanted.\u00a0 While the crew and cast enjoyed Murnau\u2019s demeanor and meticulousness, the bean counters began to see a budget quickly escalating, but lacked the power to control it.\u00a0 When Murnau found a specific tree he wanted to use he had the tree chopped down, floated down the river to the shooting location and propped perfectly erect exactly where he wanted to shoot it.\u00a0 When the shock of the move caused the tree to lose all its leaves, Murnau simply ordered thousands of fake leave leaves shipped from Los Angeles and had craftsmen glue them onto the tree, a task which took nearly two weeks.\n", "Murnau\u2019s meticulousness extended well beyond how the shot looked to include how the actors moved and emoted.\u00a0 He added 15 pounds of weights to O\u2019Brien\u2019s shoes for the early scenes to give him a lumbering appearance and had him hunch his shoulders to affect the weight of the world resting upon them.\u00a0 Gaynor was made to look more homely by wearing a wig that pressed her hair tightly to her head and was shot to appear even smaller than her normal diminutive stature. \u00a0Her clothes are heavy and drab and compare poorly to the 'woman from the city's' sleek and shimmery black dress.Where Murnau\u2019s attention to detail was most pronounced, however, was in the production design and creation of the sets constructed once shooting moved back to the Fox lot in Los Angeles. Partnering with German compatriot Rochus Gliese, Murnau created a hyper reality, with a mile long trolly track, a great thoroughfare multiple buildings that stretch as far as the eye can see. Using forced perspective, where the lines in the distance converge on a false and exaggerated horizon to add depth, Murnau put smaller people and objects further back, finally having little people and toy cars at the back.\u00a0 The immense set was the largest ever constructed and cost more than $200,000 to build, but it gave Murnau the look and feel of chaos that he wanted to overwhelm the countryfolk.Two particular scenes perfectly illustrate what Murnau was after and how he executed it on screen.\u00a0 The first is the scene between the husband and his lover in the marsh.\u00a0 The siren call of the mistress lures the man out towards the lake, leaving his wife alone at home to imagine their bucolic former lives. As full moon appears over a fog covered march as the man trudges towards his mistress, the camera following him as he moves through bushes and trees, almost in a circle, as he finally moves straight towards the camera itself.\u00a0 The camera spins on its axis to move from the man\u2019s perspective, resting on the mistress as she powders her nose, the moon above her providing her a vanity light.\u00a0 The man appears, with only the moon between them, they embrace and madly kiss.\u00a0 Told entirely in images, the scene captures all the emotion, dread and longing that sets the story in motion and is unlike anything in silent film in the fluid and effortless nature of the camera movement.\u00a0 The viewer is the voyeur, floating at the edge of the scene, but never intruding into it.\u00a0 It\u2019s stunning camera work by Charles Rosher and Karl Straus, designed eloquently by Murnau to bring the viewer into the story\n", "Murnau (again) directed his version of the 19th Century German legend in 1926; his last film before leaving for Hollywood to make Sunrise. An alternative take on the story of Job, Faust is about a man led astray by the devil, in the guise of the demon Mephisto (a wonderfully over-the-top Emil Jannings). Faust (G\u00f6sta Ekman) falls victim to Mephisto after the demon bets an Archangel (Werner Fuetterer) that he can destroy all the good in a man.\nIn the end, it seems Mephisto has succeeded. Faust is made miserable by the Devil\u2019s plans and in the end throws himself on a pyre to burn with his beloved. But as Mephisto claims victory, the Archangel tells him he has in fact lost the bet, because of the power of one word. Mephisto demands to know the word, and in a fit of light worthy of the Stargate in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the word 'Liebe', or 'Love', flies straight at the screen, practically punching the audience in the face with its glory!\n", "Curt Siodmak maintains that the first 5,000 marks of the 9,000-mark (roughly $2,500 US at the time) eventual total production cost of\u00a0People on Sunday\u00a0came from his own pocket. 'I had sold my first serial novel to the\u00a0Woche\u00a0magazine, which paid very well,' he said. 'I gave Robert an idea and 5,000 marks to start.' Robert Siodmak and Billy Wilder claimed that they borrowed the money from the Siodmaks\u2019 uncle, producer Heinrich Nebenzhal. Edgar Ulmer (whom, it bears mentioning, has been called 'film history\u2019s biggest liar' by Lotte Eisner) insisted in an interview in Peter Bogdanovich\u2019s\u00a0Who the Devil Made It, that he set the film up with his own money.

It was overshadowed by The Jazz Singer, the first talkie, released only two weeks later. Sunrise used the Movietone system with sound recorded optically on the film itself. Sunrise only included music and sound effects, while the Warner Bros.\u2019s Jazz Singer included a couple of spoken dialogues. Sunrise, however, remains one of the high points of silent films, combining American-style storytelling with visual effects mostly seen (until then) in European films. Today it is considered one of the greatest films ever made.By January 1928 Fox had filmed ten vaudeville shorts and a part-talkie feature, Blossom Time. During the spring of 1928, these efforts, along with Fox's newsreels and Warners\u2019 shorts and part-talkies, proved to be the hits of the season. Thus, in May 1928 William Fox declared that 100 percent of the upcoming production schedule would be Movietone. Simultaneously Fox Film continued to wire, as quickly as possible, all the houses in its ever-expanding chain, and draw up plans for an all-sound Hollywood-based studio. Fox's innovation of sound neared completion; colossal profits loomed on the horizon. William Fox\u2019s vision and Theodore Case\u2019s tenacity and inventions changed the movie landscape forever.

He was at the mountain top of his industry, but it was short lived.\u00a0 A July 1929 automobile accident left him hospitalized and near death.\u00a0 As events of that fall began to take hold, it became apparent he had overextended himself financially and when banks called in his notes after the October Stock Market crash, Fox, still in his hospital bed, was left near penniless.\u00a0 He lost the MGM deal and in 1930 was forced to sell his empire for a mere $15 million dollars.\u00a0 He never made another film and by 1941 was actually sentenced to prison for bribing a judge, sealing his fate on the dustbin of history.\n", "When Murnau finally arrived in New York in July of 1926, he was feted by Fox, who promptly offered the director a four-year contract extension, with a salary elevating to $200,000 in the final year.\u00a0 The director agreed and headed off to California to scout for locations for the rural opening sequence of the film.\u00a0 In what would be a harbinger of things to come, Murnau decided that Lake Arrowhead would be the perfect setting for the country home of the farmer and his wife, but insisted that a small town be constructed across the lake from the already existing community.\u00a0 A robust $750,000 budget was assigned to the film and Fox granted Murnau complete freedom to cast whom he wanted and gave him access to the very best technicians on the Fox lot.At the time of her casting Janet Gaynor was a 20-year-old ing\u00e9nue with just four credited roles to her name, but already she was the top actress on the Fox lot.\u00a0 In films like The Johnstown Flood, The Shamrock Handicap and Midnight Kiss, all made in 1926, she had established herself as one of Hollywood\u2019s leading ladies.\u00a0 George O\u2019Brien, who would be cast as her husband, had been plucked from stuntman obscurity to star in John Ford\u2019s The Iron Horse in 1924 and quickly established his box office appeal in four subsequent Ford films.\u00a0 Both actors relied on more naturalistic acting styles that were evolving as silent film matured, with Gaynor endearing herself playing sweet innocent damsels and O\u2019Brien as a rugged, but sensitive tough guy.\u00a0 They were both perfect for Murnau, who liked his actors to convey feelings and actions without dramatic pantomime.Once photography began at the Lake Arrowhead location everyone involved realized this would be unlike any film they had worked on before.\u00a0 Murnau\u2019s attention to detail was unique among directors, particularly directors used to working in the Hollywood system of burn and turn camera takes.\u00a0 Instead, Murnau would often engage in as many as 20-30 takes of a single shot, sometimes waiting for light to reflect off a background object to capture the mood he wanted.\u00a0 While the crew and cast enjoyed Murnau\u2019s demeanor and meticulousness, the bean counters began to see a budget quickly escalating, but lacked the power to control it.\u00a0 When Murnau found a specific tree he wanted to use he had the tree chopped down, floated down the river to the shooting location and propped perfectly erect exactly where he wanted to shoot it.\u00a0 When the shock of the move caused the tree to lose all its leaves, Murnau simply ordered thousands of fake leave leaves shipped from Los Angeles and had craftsmen glue them onto the tree, a task which took nearly two weeks.\n", "Murnau\u2019s meticulousness extended well beyond how the shot looked to include how the actors moved and emoted.\u00a0 He added 15 pounds of weights to O\u2019Brien\u2019s shoes for the early scenes to give him a lumbering appearance and had him hunch his shoulders to affect the weight of the world resting upon them.\u00a0 Gaynor was made to look more homely by wearing a wig that pressed her hair tightly to her head and was shot to appear even smaller than her normal diminutive stature. \u00a0Her clothes are heavy and drab and compare poorly to the 'woman from the city's' sleek and shimmery black dress.Where Murnau\u2019s attention to detail was most pronounced, however, was in the production design and creation of the sets constructed once shooting moved back to the Fox lot in Los Angeles. Partnering with German compatriot Rochus Gliese, Murnau created a hyper reality, with a mile long trolly track, a great thoroughfare multiple buildings that stretch as far as the eye can see. Using forced perspective, where the lines in the distance converge on a false and exaggerated horizon to add depth, Murnau put smaller people and objects further back, finally having little people and toy cars at the back.\u00a0 The immense set was the largest ever constructed and cost more than $200,000 to build, but it gave Murnau the look and feel of chaos that he wanted to overwhelm the countryfolk.Two particular scenes perfectly illustrate what Murnau was after and how he executed it on screen.\u00a0 The first is the scene between the husband and his lover in the marsh.\u00a0 The siren call of the mistress lures the man out towards the lake, leaving his wife alone at home to imagine their bucolic former lives. As full moon appears over a fog covered march as the man trudges towards his mistress, the camera following him as he moves through bushes and trees, almost in a circle, as he finally moves straight towards the camera itself.\u00a0 The camera spins on its axis to move from the man\u2019s perspective, resting on the mistress as she powders her nose, the moon above her providing her a vanity light.\u00a0 The man appears, with only the moon between them, they embrace and madly kiss.\u00a0 Told entirely in images, the scene captures all the emotion, dread and longing that sets the story in motion and is unlike anything in silent film in the fluid and effortless nature of the camera movement.\u00a0 The viewer is the voyeur, floating at the edge of the scene, but never intruding into it.\u00a0 It\u2019s stunning camera work by Charles Rosher and Karl Straus, designed eloquently by Murnau to bring the viewer into the story\n", "\u001b[92m[5] Murnau (again) directed his version of the 19th Century German legend in 1926; his last film before leaving for Hollywood to make Sunrise.\u001b[0m An alternative take on the story of Job, Faust is about a man led astray by the devil, in the guise of the demon Mephisto (a wonderfully over-the-top Emil Jannings). \u001b[92m[8] Faust (G\u00f6sta Ekman) falls victim to Mephisto after the demon bets an Archangel (Werner Fuetterer) that he can destroy all the good in a man.\u001b[0m\nIn the end, it seems Mephisto has succeeded.

{"ID": 294, "All Sources": ["GEORGE HARRISON'S BEST 10 ALBUMS!!LONG TIME AGO....AFTER HE WAS FAB!After the breakup of The Beatles in 1970, George Harrison established himself as bonafide musical workforce, mainly with the massive success of his debut album All Thing Must Pass, his charity concert and album The Concert for Bangladesh and its follow up Living In The Material World. The second half of the 70's saw George struggling \u00a0personally, artistically and commercially to sustain his career and after hits and misses, he decided to withdraw from the music business in the early 80's. After his 1987 smash hit album Cloud Nine, George went back to the spotlight as a top selling artist, enjoying success working with \u00a0Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne as The Traveling Wilburys and going on tour with Eric Clapton in 1991.\u00a0After this he went back to his quiet life and sadly battled with cancer for the last part of the 90's, even surviving a killing attempt, until his passing in 2001. He left a legacy of inspiring work that showed his struggle between the spiritual and material world. A duality that gave us beautiful songs that are still heard and cherished all over the world.The criteria we used for this list other than songwriting and performance quality is the albums impact, longevity and legacy. As we have done with our other compilations, we have included live albums, as we believe these are valid demonstrations of his work.\n", "4. BRAINWASHED (2002)George Harrison's final words to the world came in the form of 'Brainwashed', his last album. Released posthumously on 18 November 2002, almost a year after his death, the album presents George Harrison's reflections on his life. \u00a0Although the tracks on the album were recorded as early as 1988, the album was completed almost a year after by George's son Dhani and Jeff Lynne. Work was delayed since the beginning by business problems with Harrison's former manager, Denis O'Brien, as well as his work with the Traveling Wilburys, Ravi Shankar, and his work on The Beatles Anthology. After recuperating from being attacked in his home on 30 December 1999, Harrison focused on finishing the album, simultaneously sharing his ideas in detail with his son Dhani, as Dhani helped to complete the album after his father\u2019s death. \u00a0Harrison underwent surgery to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and radiotherapy for lung cancer which had metastasized to his brain. Once he realised it was an irreversible situation, he worked further on the album's songs \u2013 in conjunction with Dhani and his old collaborator Jeff Lynne \u2013 until he was unable to do more.\u00a0The album shows George musically sound and mature. Having come to terms with his past with The Beatles, the tumultuous 70's, the cruelty of the music industry and fame and embracing his imminent death. Beautiful album with lyrics that will make you miss George even more.In 2004, Brainwashed's 'Marwa Blues' won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album, as well as Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the track 'Any Road'.Highlights: Any Road, P2 Vatican Blues (Last Saturday Night), Pisces Fish, Looking for My Life, Stuck Inside a Cloud, Run So FarGeorge Harrison brainwashed album cover.

GEORGE HARRISON (1979)George Harrison's eighth studio album, simply titled 'George Harrison', was written and recorded through much of 1978, a period of reconstruction for Harrison after his mid-70's downfall, (both personal and professionally), and a year in which he married Olivia Arias and became a father for the first time. Harrison wrote several new songs in Hawaii, among them 'Blow Away' and revived and all Beatles track 'Not Guilty', which he originally recorded in 1968. \u00a0Again, George was joined by an all star cast of musicians, including Steve Winwood, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark, with Eric Clapton and Gary Wright making guest appearances.\u00a0The album was well-received by music critics on release, many citing it among the artist's best works. The light-hearted feel and positiveness in George's life comes out in a soft-rock and pop atmosphere that was absent in previous albums.\u00a0Highlights: Love Comes to Everyone, Here Comes the Moon, Blow Away, Dark Sweet Lady, Your Love Is Forever, Soft Touch, If You Believe.George Harrison \u00a0album cover.

The song originated as a slide guitar tune, to which Harrison later added lyrics relating to the illusory nature of love \u2013 'maya' being a Sanskrit term for 'illusion', or 'that which is not'. Harrison's biographers consider the lyrical theme to be reflective of his failed marriage to Pattie Boyd, who left him for his friend Eric Clapton shortly before the words were written. Harrison recorded the song at his home, Friar Park, on the eve of his North American tour with Ravi Shankar, which took place in November and December 1974. The recording features Harrison's slide guitar extensively and contributions from four musicians who formed the nucleus of his tour band: Billy Preston, Tom Scott, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark. Reviewers note the track as an example of its parent album's more diverse musical genres, namely funk and rhythm and blues, compared with the more traditional rock orientation of Harrison's earlier solo work. Harrison played 'M\u0101ya Love' throughout his 1974 tour, although no live recording has ever been officially released. The song later appeared as the B-side of Harrison's second single off his 1975 album 'Extra TextureThis Guitar ( Can't Keep from Crying)', which was the final release by Apple Records in its original incarnation. ", "George Harrison (25 February 1943 \u2013 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called 'the quiet Beatle', Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included 'TaxmanWithin You Without YouWhile My Guitar Gently WeepsHere Comes the Sun' and 'Something'. Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on 'Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)'. Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album 'All Things Must Pass', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, 'My Sweet Lord', and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978. Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. ' Rolling Stone' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the '100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time'. He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004. Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his Friar Park home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost \u00a3100 million.

", "Jacques Rivette (1 March 1928 \u2013 29 January 2016) was a French film director and film critic most commonly associated with the French New Wave and the film magazine 'Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma'. He made twenty-nine films, including 'L'amour fou' (1969), 'Out 1' (1971), 'Celine and Julie Go Boating' (1974), and 'La Belle Noiseuse' (1991). His work is noted for its improvisation, loose narratives, and lengthy running times. Inspired by Jean Cocteau to become a filmmaker, Rivette shot his first short film at age twenty. He moved to Paris to pursue his career, frequenting Henri Langlois' Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise and other cin\u00e9-clubs; there, he met Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, \u00c9ric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol and other future members of the New Wave. Rivette began writing film criticism, and was hired by Andr\u00e9 Bazin for 'Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma' in 1953. In his criticism, he expressed an admiration for American films \u2013 especially those of genre directors such as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray \u2013 and was deeply critical of mainstream French cinema. Rivette's articles, admired by his peers, were considered the magazine's best and most aggressive writings, particularly his 1961 article 'On Abjection' and his influential series of interviews with film directors co-written with Truffaut. He continued making short films, including 'Le Coup de Berger', which is often cited as the first New Wave film. Truffaut later credited Rivette with developing the movement. Although he was the first New Wave director to begin work on a feature film, 'Paris Belongs to Us' was not released until 1961, by which time Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard released their own first features and popularised the movement worldwide. Rivette became editor of 'Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma' during the early 1960s and publicly fought French censorship of his second feature film, 'The Nun' (1966). He then re-evaluated his career, developing a unique cinematic style with 'L'amour fou'. Influenced by the political turmoil of May 68, improvisational theatre and an in-depth interview with filmmaker Jean Renoir, Rivette began working with large groups of actors on character development and allowing events to unfold on camera. This technique led to the thirteen-hour 'Out 1' which, although rarely screened, is considered a Holy Grail of cinephiles. His films of the 1970s, such as 'Celine and Julie Go Boating', often incorporated fantasy and were better-regarded. After attempting to make four consecutive films, however, Rivette had a nervous breakdown and his career slowed for several years. During the early 1980s, he began a business partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette's output increased from then on, and his film 'La Belle Noiseuse' received international praise. He retired after completing 'Around a Small Mountain' (2009), and it was revealed three years later that he had Alzheimer's disease. Very private about his personal life, Rivette was briefly married to photographer and screenwriter Maril\u00f9 Parolini during the early 1960s and later married V\u00e9ronique Manniez.

Some confusion may have arisen here owing to MGM/Verve's apparent withdrawal of the album after its initial release, followed by its re-release with further objectionable lyrics censored. Thus it is likely that the earlier date is the more accurate one, and that therefore the Mothers of Invention had three albums out by the time Lumpy Gravy appeared.\n6 See 'My Favorite Album' (Zappa interview excerpt, 22 October 1971, KBEY-FM, Kansas City), Lumpy Money, Disc III, Track 7, in which one of Zappa's interlocutors mentions his frustration at not being able to locate a copy of Lumpy Gravy to purchase after months of searching.\n", "39 Zappa, Civilization Phaze III, liner notes, 2\u20133.

The razor-blade edits for the final version of Lumpy Gravy must have been done at Apostolic and/or Mayfair, since much of the material was not recorded until Zappa was in New York and working at those studios.\n", "Abstract Among the vast recorded output of Frank Zappa's remarkable career, two albums\u2014the very early Lumpy Gravy (1968) and the posthumously released Civilization Phaze III (1994)\u2014have special significance, not only for their great originality but also for the conceptual link between them. A close examination of these works, together with recently issued audio-archival material that provides a basis for conjecture about the genesis of Lumpy Gravy, reveals much about Zappa's unique position in the realms of popular and art music as he negotiated the boundary between them.

It was commissioned and briefly released, on August 7, 1967, by Capitol Records in the 4- track Stereo- Pak format only and then withdrawn due to a lawsuit from MGM Records.

Zappa conducted the orchestra but did not perform on the album. It is his third album overall: his previous releases had been under the name of his group, the Mothers of Invention. It was commissioned and briefly released, on August 7, 1967, by Capitol Records in the 4- track Stereo- Pak format only and then withdrawn due to a lawsuit from MGM Records. MGM claimed that the album violated Zappa's contract with their subsidiary, Verve Records. In 1968 it was reedited and released by MGM's Verve Records on May 13, 1968. The final version of the album consisted of two musique concr\u00e8te pieces that combined elements from the original orchestral performance with elements of surf music and the spoken word. It was praised for its music and editing. Produced simultaneously with' We're Only in It for the Money', Zappa saw' Lumpy Gravy' as the second part of a conceptual continuity that later included his final album,' Civilization Phaze III'.

He was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou and the only son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno. His father was the eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary. She laid claim to Hungary after her brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, died in 1290, but the Hungarian prelates and lords elected her cousin, Andrew III, king. Instead of abandoning her claim to Hungary, she transferred it to her son, Charles Martel, and after his death in 1295, to her grandson, Charles. On the other hand, her husband, Charles II of Naples, made their third son, Robert, heir to the Kingdom of Naples, thus disinheriting Charles. Charles came to the Kingdom of Hungary upon the invitation of an influential Croatian lord, Paul \u0160ubi\u0107, in August 1300. Andrew III died on 14 January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had no central government, the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch. One of those oligarchs, Ladislaus III K\u00e1n, captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307. Charles was elected king in Pest on 27 November 1308, but his rule remained nominal in most parts of his kingdom even after he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27 August 1310. Charles won his first decisive victory in the Battle of Rozgony (at present-day Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15 June 1312. After that his troops seized most fortresses of the powerful Aba family. During the next decade, Charles restored royal power primarily with the assistance of the prelates and lesser noblemen in most regions of the kingdom. After the death of the most powerful oligarch, Matthew Cs\u00e1k, in 1321, Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom, with the exception of Croatia where local noblemen were able to preserve their autonomous status. He was not able to hinder the development of Wallachia into an independent principality after his defeat in the Battle of Posada in 1330. Charles's contemporaries described his defeat in that battle as a punishment from God for his cruel revenge against the family of Felician Z\u00e1h who had attempted to slaughter the royal family. Charles rarely made perpetual land grants, instead introducing a system of 'office fiefs', whereby his officials enjoyed significant revenues, but only for the time they held a royal office, which ensured their loyalty. In the second half of his reign, Charles did not hold Diets and administered his kingdom with absolute power. He established the Order of Saint George, which was the first secular order of knights. He promoted the opening of new gold mines, which made Hungary the largest producer of gold in Europe. The first Hungarian gold coins were minted during his reign. At the congress of Visegr\u00e1d in 1335, he mediated a reconciliation between two neighboring monarchs, John of Bohemia and Casimir III of Poland. Treaties signed at the same congress also contributed to the development of new commercial routes linking Hungary with Western Europe. Charles's efforts to reunite Hungary, together with his administrative and economic reforms, established the basis for the achievements of his successor, Louis the Great.

", "Charles I, also known as Charles Robert (128816 July 1342) was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1308 to his death. He was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou and the only son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno. His father was the eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary. She laid claim to Hungary after her brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, died in 1290, but the Hungarian prelates and lords elected her cousin, Andrew III, king. Instead of abandoning her claim to Hungary, she transferred it to her son, Charles Martel, and after his death in 1295, to her grandson, Charles. On the other hand, her husband, Charles II of Naples, made their third son, Robert, heir to the Kingdom of Naples, thus disinheriting Charles. Charles came to the Kingdom of Hungary upon the invitation of an influential Croatian lord, Paul \u0160ubi\u0107, in August 1300. Andrew III died on 14 January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305.

{"ID": 322, "All Sources": ["But fate won\u2019t let them be. When he returns home, his wife has been completing work on the garden. They\u2019ve put a fountain. And she decides that the only thing missing, is a statue, something like the Venus de Milo. He goes to a gallery and finds the statue he\u2019s looking for, a statue clearly modelled on Raquel, who he finds there, half-dressed after having posed for the sculptorp. It\u2019s called \u2018The Kneeling Goddess\u2019, she informs him, \u2018but it\u2019s really just a woman on her knees, the way men like to see them be.\u2019\n", "As Moviediva argues, \u2018La diosa\u00a0tackles one of Gavaldon\u2019s recurring themes, death, in this case the death of a man\u2019s spirit, as he is corrupted by his love for a femme fatale.\u00a0 He loves the use of mirrors, used to demonstrate duality, and here, also the decay of the hero\u2019s morality.\u00a0 Because there was no Production Code in Mexico, this film is surprisingly sexy for a 1940s film\u2019. Indeed as you can see in the images above, whereas the wife was always associated with high culture, refinement and respectability, Raquel is constantly associated with sex, a Circe who will drive men to ridicule and ruin. As J. Hoberman writes, \u00a0The Kneeling Goddess \u00a0\u2018is the\u00a0most outr\u00e9 of melodramas, it\u2019s a movie of flagrant symbols, blatant coincidences and astounding scenes \u2026(and Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix is) a\u00a0femme fatale to rival any from 1940s Hollywood, F\u00e9lix embodies a moral ambiguity beyond good and evil.\u2019\n", "What drives the narrative engine of The Kneeling Goddess, the motor of all noir, is desire. In this case, Antonio\u2019s for Raquel. The film tells us this most directly. When he returns home to his office and his wife, Antonio looks outside, to a sign urging lovers to \u2018Use Desire, the Perfume of Lovers\u2019. The film doesn\u2019t want us to miss this so the score urgently and loudly underlines its significance.\n\u2018What do you understand by desire,\u2019 Antonio asks his butler? \u2018what one longs for, what one wants..\u2019. \u2018Exactly. But it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s a force that obliges you. That propels you to obtain what you want, and to keep it if you\u2019ve already obtained it. Isn\u2019t that right?\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018But that force can grow, take shape, take on a life of its own, become stronger than you, and could end up destroying you. And what\u2019s worse destroy all those closest to you.\u2019\n", "In his introduction to\u00a0La fatalidad urbana: El cine de Roberto Gavald\u00f3n (Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, 2007), Fernando Mino Gracia writes:\nWhat would Mexican cinema be without the the sure look \u2014 distant, reflexive \u2014 of Roberto Gavald\u00f3n. We would have lost no less that the most rounded, audacious and finished oeuvre, one that explains a fundamental period of Twentieth Century Mexican cinema, that which covers the period of the end of the Second World War to the start of the 70s. Because Gavald\u00f3n is the the filmmaker who best diagnosed, over the entirety of his work, the pulse of a society in the process of consolidation. Nothing was the same by the end of the 1950s and Gavald\u00f3n was a privileged witness and chronicler.

When he returns home, his wife has been completing work on the garden. They\u2019ve put a fountain. And she decides that the only thing missing, is a statue, something like the Venus de Milo. He goes to a gallery and finds the statue he\u2019s looking for, a statue clearly modelled on Raquel, who he finds there, half-dressed after having posed for the sculptorp. It\u2019s called \u2018The Kneeling Goddess\u2019, she informs him, \u2018but it\u2019s really just a woman on her knees, the way men like to see them be.\u2019\n", "As Moviediva argues, \u2018La diosa\u00a0tackles one of Gavaldon\u2019s recurring themes, death, in this case the death of a man\u2019s spirit, as he is corrupted by his love for a femme fatale.\u00a0 He loves the use of mirrors, used to demonstrate duality, and here, also the decay of the hero\u2019s morality.\u00a0 Because there was no Production Code in Mexico, this film is surprisingly sexy for a 1940s film\u2019. Indeed as you can see in the images above, whereas the wife was always associated with high culture, refinement and respectability, Raquel is constantly associated with sex, a Circe who will drive men to ridicule and ruin. As J. Hoberman writes, \u00a0The Kneeling Goddess \u00a0\u2018is the\u00a0most outr\u00e9 of melodramas, it\u2019s a movie of flagrant symbols, blatant coincidences and astounding scenes \u2026(and Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix is) a\u00a0femme fatale to rival any from 1940s Hollywood, F\u00e9lix embodies a moral ambiguity beyond good and evil.\u2019\n", "What drives the narrative engine of The Kneeling Goddess, the motor of all noir, is desire. In this case, Antonio\u2019s for Raquel. The film tells us this most directly. When he returns home to his office and his wife, Antonio looks outside, to a sign urging lovers to \u2018Use Desire, the Perfume of Lovers\u2019. The film doesn\u2019t want us to miss this so the score urgently and loudly underlines its significance.\n\u2018What do you understand by desire,\u2019 Antonio asks his butler? \u2018what one longs for, what one wants..\u2019. \u2018Exactly. But it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s a force that obliges you. That propels you to obtain what you want, and to keep it if you\u2019ve already obtained it. Isn\u2019t that right?\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018But that force can grow, take shape, take on a life of its own, become stronger than you, and could end up destroying you. And what\u2019s worse destroy all those closest to you.\u2019\n", "In his introduction to\u00a0La fatalidad urbana: El cine de Roberto Gavald\u00f3n (Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, 2007), Fernando Mino Gracia writes:\nWhat would Mexican cinema be without the the sure look \u2014 distant, reflexive \u2014 of Roberto Gavald\u00f3n. We would have lost no less that the most rounded, audacious and finished oeuvre, one that explains a fundamental period of Twentieth Century Mexican cinema, that which covers the period of the end of the Second World War to the start of the 70s. Because Gavald\u00f3n is the the filmmaker who best diagnosed, over the entirety of his work, the pulse of a society in the process of consolidation. Nothing was the same by the end of the 1950s and Gavald\u00f3n was a privileged witness and chronicler.

The song was one of Jones' best early ballads, included on many of his early studio and compilation albums with Starday and Mercury Records in the late 1950s.

", "George Glenn Jones (September 12, 1931 \u2013 April 26, 2013) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He achieved international fame for his long list of hit records, including his best-known song ' He Stopped Loving Her Today', as well as his distinctive voice and phrasing. For the last twenty years of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer. Country music scholar Bill Malone writes, 'For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.' Waylon Jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song ' It's AlrightIf we all could sound like we wanted to, we'd all sound like George Jones. ' The shape of his nose and facial features earned Jones the nickname 'The Possum'. Born in Texas, Jones first heard country music when he was seven and was given a guitar at the age of nine. He married his first wife, Dorothy Bonvillion, in 1950, and was divorced in 1951. He served in the United States Marine Corps and was discharged in 1953. He married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. In 1959, Jones recorded 'White Lightning', written by J. P. Richardson, which launched his career as a singer. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1968; he married fellow country music singer Tammy Wynette a year later. Years of alcoholism compromised his health and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname 'No Show Jones'. After his divorce from Wynette in 1975, Jones married his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvado, in 1983 and became sober for good in 1999. Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure. During his career, Jones had more than 150 hits, both as a solo artist and in duets with other artists. Robert Christgau has called him 'honky-tonk's greatest honky'.

The plot plays off the characterization of Southerners as vampires and Lincoln\u2019s crusade to avenge his mother\u2019s death at the hands of one such vampire.\u00a0 Lincoln uses his vampire-hunting knowledge to save the Union through the use of silver bullets. While Lincoln was not a vampire hunter, and the South was not inhabited by said vampires, Vampire Hunter uses the general framework of the Civil War to create an interesting and fast-paced fictional film.\u00a0 The film utilizes the fascination with Lincoln in a creative, albeit mostly fictional, way.Lincoln in Books\n", "Photograph: Stephen VaughanSurprisingly, a search of the Abraham Lincoln Papers at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC brings up no results for 'vampire'.

In 1945 his film 'O sole mio' got critical acclaim, but later his career was mainly devoted to genre films, and failed to achieve significant critical interest. Dissatisfied with cinema, in the mid-1960s Gentilomo decided to abandon films and to fulfill his passion for painting.
