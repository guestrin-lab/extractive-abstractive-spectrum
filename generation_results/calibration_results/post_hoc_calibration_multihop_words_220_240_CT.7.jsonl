This film combines great story writing with precise interpersonal direction. Both Mary McDonnel and Alfre Woodard deliver characters who develop clearly throughout the story. Mr. Sayles' depiction of Cajun culture as it crosses with Yankee cultures is really quite impressive. Although the screenplay leans towards sentimentality, it never becomes trite as so many interpersonal dramas have a tendency to do. Sayle's scathing commentary on the self-centeredness of mainstream American culture through his depiction of people associated with daytime drama while avoiding any negative commentary on southern culture is refreshing and a pleasure to watch.\n19 out of 20 found this helpful\nWas this review helpful?\nSign in to vote.\nPermalink\nblissey_s12 August 2021\n7/10\nKind of Dreary\nWarning: Spoilers\n", "United Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. In 1919, Pickford established The Mary Pickford Company, that was devoted exclusively to producing films distributed by United Artists. With the film Pollyanna being Mary's first film distributed by The United Artists. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on Santa Monica Boulevard. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, her acting career had largely faded. After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades.

This film combines great story writing with precise interpersonal direction. Both Mary McDonnel and Alfre Woodard deliver characters who develop clearly throughout the story. Mr. Sayles' depiction of Cajun culture as it crosses with Yankee cultures is really quite impressive. Although the screenplay leans towards sentimentality, it never becomes trite as so many interpersonal dramas have a tendency to do. Sayle's scathing commentary on the self-centeredness of mainstream American culture through his depiction of people associated with daytime drama while avoiding any negative commentary on southern culture is refreshing and a pleasure to watch.\n19 out of 20 found this helpful\nWas this review helpful?\nSign in to vote.\nPermalink\nblissey_s12 August 2021\n7/10\nKind of Dreary\nWarning: Spoilers\n", "United Artists broke from this tradition.

It is based on a short story Raimi wrote that paid homage to Universal's horror films of the 1930s. The film stars Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake, a scientist who is brutally attacked, disfigured and left for dead by a ruthless mobster, Robert Durant( Larry Drake), after his girlfriend, an attorney( Frances McDormand), runs afoul of a corrupt developer( Colin Friels). After a failed treatment to cure him of his burn injuries, Westlake develops super- human abilities, which also has the unintended side- effect of rendering him mentally unstable and borderline psychotic. Consumed with vengeance, he decides to hunt down the men responsible for his disfigurement. Unable to secure the rights to either' The Shadow' or' Batman', Raimi decided to create his own superhero and struck a deal with Universal Studios to make his first Hollywood studio film. It was produced by Robert Tapert, and was written by Raimi, his brother Ivan Raimi and Chuck Pfarrer. The design and creation of the makeup effects required to turn Liam Neeson into Darkman were the handiwork of makeup effects artist Tony Gardner, who also cameos in the film as the Lizard Man in the carnival Freak Show sequence. Neeson's first action film,' Darkman' received generally positive reviews by critics and was a box office success, grossing almost$ 49 million worldwide, well above its$ 16 million budget. This financial success spawned two direct- to- video sequels,( 1995) and( 1996), as well as comic books, video games, and action figures. Over the years,' Darkman' has become regarded as a cult film. Neeson does not reprise his role for the direct- to- video sequels. ", "\u001b[92m[0] The Marriage Cheat is a 1924 American drama film directed by John Griffith Wray and written by C.

Backed by an instrumental of ripping guitars, the dance-pop and R&B song draws some influences from doo-wop, with lyrics about men who cannot take the hint when their advances towards women are rejected. Its composition was compared by several critics to various pop artists of the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as Britney Spears and NSYNC. ' No' was a commercial success, becoming Trainor's second single to reach the top three on the US 'Billboard' Hot 100, peaking at number three. It also reached the top ten in several European countries (Austria, Spain, Scotland), as well as in Australia and Canada. Fatima Robinson directed the music video for 'No'. It was set at a warehouse, noted to be visually darker than Trainor's previous clips and featured her dancing alongside an all-female dance troupe. The clip drew comparisons to the works of Spears and Madonna for its sexual nature. Trainor has performed 'No' on several shows, including the 3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards, 'The Graham Norton ShowThe Ellen DeGeneres Show', and the 2016 'Billboard' Music Awards.

Interested in music from a young age, she wrote, recorded, and produced three independently released albums between 2009 and 2011. Since signing with Epic Records in 2014, Trainor has earned three top-five singles on the US 'Billboard' Hot 100; 'All About That Bass' topped the chart for eight consecutive weeks, 'Lips Are Movin' consecutively became her second top-five single, and 'No' became her fastest to reach the top five. Her debut major-label studio album, 'Title' (2015), on which the former two singles are included, debuted atop the US 'Billboard' 200 and was certified Triple Platinum by the RIAA. Her second major-label studio album, 'Thank You' (2016), on which the latter single is included, debuted at number three in the US and was certified Platinum in the country. Trainor is influenced by music from the 1950s and 1960s and is known for her throwback style. Her lyrics frequently refer to modern womanhood, body image, and empowerment. She has received several awards and nominations, including a Grammy Award, four ASCAP Pop Music Awards, and two 'Billboard' Music Awards. Outside of music, Trainor has lent her voice to animated films and served as a judge on  and will serve as a coach on 'The Voice UK' in 2020. ", "'No' (stylized in all caps) is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor for her second major-label studio album ' Thank You' (2016). It was written by Trainor, Eric Frederic, and Jacob Kasher Hindlin, and produced by Ricky Reed. The track was released on March 4, 2016, as the lead single from the album. Backed by an instrumental of ripping guitars, the dance-pop and R&B song draws some influences from doo-wop, with lyrics about men who cannot take the hint when their advances towards women are rejected. Its composition was compared by several critics to various pop artists of the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as Britney Spears and NSYNC. ' No' was a commercial success, becoming Trainor's second single to reach the top three on the US 'Billboard' Hot 100, peaking at number three. It also reached the top ten in several European countries (Austria, Spain, Scotland), as well as in Australia and Canada. Fatima Robinson directed the music video for 'No'. It was set at a warehouse, noted to be visually darker than Trainor's previous clips and featured her dancing alongside an all-female dance troupe. The clip drew comparisons to the works of Spears and Madonna for its sexual nature. Trainor has performed 'No' on several shows, including the 3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards, 'The Graham Norton ShowThe Ellen DeGeneres Show', and the 2016 'Billboard' Music Awards. She also performed it during The Untouchable Tour (2016).

There are other easily recognisable character actors here too, like Forrest Tucker and a very young Denver Pyle, but I\u2019m watching for John Russell, who would have been a hundred years old on 3rd January, 2021 and he\u2019s arguably the best thing about the film. He\u2019s one of four highlighted co-stars and he\u2019s the only one with a story arc, as his character is just as important to this story as McCrea\u2019s, important enough that he literally gets the last word.

This film starts solid with an extremely dramatic opening and then follows the basic slasher whodunnit outline. I didn't find any of the characters interesting nor do I remember a single person's name so it was kinda hard to stay invested when I don't have a connection to anyone.After the killer is revealed the movie then rushes to the end. Not sure if the director wanted to keep the run time short or if they just didn't know how to end the film but it literally sprints to the end.

There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s wrong with it, but it takes root in your brain and stays with you, because it also does quite a lot very right indeed. The lead is Joel McCrea, playing very much against type as the story\u2019s bad guy, though oddly he\u2019s also one of the good guys; the explanation of that sentence would count as a good synopsis of the film. There are other easily recognisable character actors here too, like Forrest Tucker and a very young Denver Pyle, but I\u2019m watching for John Russell, who would have been a hundred years old on 3rd January, 2021 and he\u2019s arguably the best thing about the film. He\u2019s one of four highlighted co-stars and he\u2019s the only one with a story arc, as his character is just as important to this story as McCrea\u2019s, important enough that he literally gets the last word. His story arc both goes in the right direction and in the direction of right, making him our moral compass in a complex situation.\n", "In August 2018, it was reported that Legendary Pictures had entered preliminary negotiations to purchase the film rights to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, with the studio intending to adapt television and film installments. The following year, Fede \u00c1lvarez signed onto the project as producer. In November 2019, Chris Thomas Devlin joined the production as screenwriter. In February 2020, Ryan Tohill and Andy Tohill were hired to serve as directors for the film, with Angus Mitchell signed on as cinematographer after collaborating on The Dig (2018). In May of the same year, it was announced that the film would serve as a sequel to the original film and feature a 60-year-old Leatherface, notably similar to the approach that Blumhouse Productions took with their Halloween films.

Let me start by saying that this film has quite graphic kills and inventive kills at that. This film starts solid with an extremely dramatic opening and then follows the basic slasher whodunnit outline. I didn't find any of the characters interesting nor do I remember a single person's name so it was kinda hard to stay invested when I don't have a connection to anyone.After the killer is revealed the movie then rushes to the end. Not sure if the director wanted to keep the run time short or if they just didn't know how to end the film but it literally sprints to the end.

He was the son of Sultan Mahmud II and succeeded his brother Abdulmejid I in 1861. Born at Ey\u00fcp Palace, Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), on 8 February 1830, Abd\u00fclaziz received an Ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the West. He was the first Ottoman Sultan who travelled to Western Europe, visiting a number of important European capitals including Paris, London and Vienna in the summer of 1867. Apart from his passion for the Ottoman Navy, which had the world's third largest fleet in 1875 (after the British and French navies), the Sultan took an interest in documenting the Ottoman Empire. He was also interested in literature and was a talented classical music composer.

Born at Ey\u00fcp Palace, Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), on 8 February 1830, Abd\u00fclaziz received an Ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the West. He was the first Ottoman Sultan who travelled to Western Europe, visiting a number of important European capitals including Paris, London and Vienna in the summer of 1867.

The song, making an appearance on the band's 1975 album 'Soap Opera', was written by Ray Davies, the band's main songwriter. ", "The Kinks are an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1964 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965 (as a result of constant fighting between the brothers). Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned 'You Really Got Me', became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, American rock and roll, British music hall, folk, and country. They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' wittily observational writing style, and are considered one of the most influential groups of the period. Early works included albums such as 'Face to Face' (1966), 'Something Else' (1967), 'The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society' (1968), 'Arthur' (1969), 'Lola Versus Powerman' (1970), and 'Muswell Hillbillies' (1971), along with their accompanying singles. After a fallow period in the mid-1970s, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with their albums 'Sleepwalker' (1977), 'Misfits' (1978), 'Low Budget' (1979), 'Give the People What They Want' (1981) and 'State of Confusion' (1983). In addition, groups such as Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders and the Fall covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence. Ray Davies (rhythm guitar, lead vocals, keyboards) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the band's 32-year run. Longest-serving member Mick Avory (drums and percussion) was replaced by Bob Henrit, formerly of Argent, in 1984. Original bass guitarist Pete Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969, and Dalton was in turn replaced by Argent bassist Jim Rodford in 1978. Session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings in the mid-to-late 1960s. In 1969 the band became an official five-piece when keyboardist John Gosling joined them, being replaced by Ian Gibbons in 1979, who remained in the band until they broke up in 1996 as a result of the commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers. The Kinks have had five Top 10 singles on the US 'Billboard' chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, The Kinks have had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four of their albums have been certified gold by the RIAA and the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for 'Outstanding Service to British Music'. In 1990, the original four members of The Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005. In 2018, after years of ruling out a reunion, Ray Davies and Dave Davies announced they were working to reform the Kinks.

{"ID": 268, "All Sources": ["Jack London's novel has inspired at least nine film versions with the first one, produced in 1913, remaining the most faithful to the book. Other renditions include the 1920 version with Noah Beery in the Wolf Larsen role, a 1926 version starring Ralph Ince, a 1930 remake featuring Milton Sills, a version entitled Barricade (1950) with Raymond Massey, Wolf Larsen (1958), a pet project of actor Sterling Hayden which starred Barry Sullivan, Larsen: Wolf of the Seven Seas (1975), an Italian production with Chuck Connors in the title role, and a made-for-TV version in 1993 starring Charles Bronson. But by general consensus, the 1941 production of The Sea Wolf, directed by Michael Curtiz, is considered the most effective adaptation due to Edward G. Robinson's definitive portrayal and Robert Rossen's screenplay which accents the psychological and allegorical aspects of the story.\n", "While the 1941 version of The Sea Wolf remained faithful in spirit to the London novel, screenwriter Robert Rossen, who was a fervent anti-Fascist, drew upon current events to establish an obvious parallel between Larsen's dictatorial nature and that of a contemporary fanatic like Hitler. He also made several important changes in the storyline; he split the narrative, giving equal time to the battle of wills between Larsen and Van Weyden (Alexander Knox) and the growing romance between Leach and Ruth Webster (Ida Lupino). In addition, he altered the climax which provided a new demise for Larsen and an unexpected fate for Van Weyden. Leach, who was drowned in the original novel, becomes the central love interest in this version, escaping to safety with Ruth Webster. All of these changes actually strengthened the film on a dramatic level and were further enhanced by Sol Polito's atmospheric cinematography and Anton Grot's art direction - both heavily influenced by the look of German Expressionist cinema. Not surprisingly, the entire film was shot on a sound stage which accounts for its claustrophobic, fog-bound atmosphere, the result of the studio's new industrial strength fog machines. Strangely enough, it wasn't the first time John Garfield and Ida Lupino had been engulfed in thick vapors. They previously appeared together the same year in Out of the Fog, a melodrama set on the Brooklyn waterfront.\n", "In an Oscar year dominated by nominations for Sergeant York, How Green Was My Valley, and Citizen Kane, The Sea Wolf found itself shut out of almost every category.

Other renditions include the 1920 version with Noah Beery in the Wolf Larsen role, a 1926 version starring Ralph Ince, a 1930 remake featuring Milton Sills, a version entitled Barricade (1950) with Raymond Massey, Wolf Larsen (1958), a pet project of actor Sterling Hayden which starred Barry Sullivan, Larsen: Wolf of the Seven Seas (1975), an Italian production with Chuck Connors in the title role, and a made-for-TV version in 1993 starring Charles Bronson. But by general consensus, the 1941 production of The Sea Wolf, directed by Michael Curtiz, is considered the most effective adaptation due to Edward G. Robinson's definitive portrayal and Robert Rossen's screenplay which accents the psychological and allegorical aspects of the story.\n", "While the 1941 version of The Sea Wolf remained faithful in spirit to the London novel, screenwriter Robert Rossen, who was a fervent anti-Fascist, drew upon current events to establish an obvious parallel between Larsen's dictatorial nature and that of a contemporary fanatic like Hitler. He also made several important changes in the storyline; he split the narrative, giving equal time to the battle of wills between Larsen and Van Weyden (Alexander Knox) and the growing romance between Leach and Ruth Webster (Ida Lupino). In addition, he altered the climax which provided a new demise for Larsen and an unexpected fate for Van Weyden. Leach, who was drowned in the original novel, becomes the central love interest in this version, escaping to safety with Ruth Webster. All of these changes actually strengthened the film on a dramatic level and were further enhanced by Sol Polito's atmospheric cinematography and Anton Grot's art direction - both heavily influenced by the look of German Expressionist cinema. Not surprisingly, the entire film was shot on a sound stage which accounts for its claustrophobic, fog-bound atmosphere, the result of the studio's new industrial strength fog machines. Strangely enough, it wasn't the first time John Garfield and Ida Lupino had been engulfed in thick vapors. They previously appeared together the same year in Out of the Fog, a melodrama set on the Brooklyn waterfront.\n", "In an Oscar year dominated by nominations for Sergeant York, How Green Was My Valley, and Citizen Kane, The Sea Wolf found itself shut out of almost every category.

He is widely considered one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema, and one of Russia's most influential filmmakers. His films explored spiritual and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature and memory. Tarkovsky studied film at Moscow's State Institute of Cinematography under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, and subsequently directed his first five feature films in the Soviet Union: 'Ivan's Childhood' (1962), 'Andrei Rublev' (1966), 'Solaris' (1972), 'Mirror' (1975), and 'Stalker' (1979). After years of creative conflict with Soviet authorities, Tarkovsky left the country in 1979 and made his final two films abroad; 'Nostalghia' (1983) and 'The Sacrifice' (1986) were produced in Italy and Sweden respectively. In 1986, he also published a book about cinema and art entitled 'Sculpting in Time'. He died of cancer later that year. Tarkovsky was the recipient of several awards at the Cannes Film Festival throughout his career (including the FIPRESCI prize, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, and the Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury) and winner of the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival for his debut film 'Ivan's Childhood'.

The film was remade and re-edited from the 1966 film titled' The Passion According to Andrei' by Tarkovsky which was censored during the first decade of the Brezhnev era in the Soviet Union. The film is loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, the 15th- century Russian icon painter. The film features Anatoly Solonitsyn, Nikolai Grinko, Ivan Lapikov, Nikolai Sergeyev, Nikolai Burlyayev and Tarkovsky's wife Irma Raush. Savva Yamshchikov, a famous Russian restorer and art historian, was a scientific consultant of the film. ' Andrei Rublev' is set against the background of 15th- century Russia. Although the film is only loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, it seeks to depict a realistic portrait of medieval Russia. Tarkovsky sought to create a film that shows the artist as' a world- historic figure' and' Christianity as an axiom of Russia's historical identity' during a turbulent period of Russian history that ultimately resulted in the Tsardom of Russia. The film's themes include artistic freedom, religion, political ambiguity, autodidacticism, and the making of art under a repressive regime. Because of this, it was not released domestically in the officially atheist Soviet Union for years after it was completed, except for a single 1966 screening in Moscow. A version of the film was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI prize. In 1971, a censored version of the film was released in the Soviet Union. The film was further cut for commercial reasons upon its U.S. release through Columbia Pictures in 1973. As a result, several versions of the film exist. Although these issues with censorship obscured and truncated the film for many years following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors as a highly original and accomplished work. Even more since being restored to its original version,' Andrei Rublev' has come to be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, and has often been ranked highly in both the' Sight& Sound' critics' and directors' polls.

In 1986, he also published a book about cinema and art entitled 'Sculpting in Time'. He died of cancer later that year. Tarkovsky was the recipient of several awards at the Cannes Film Festival throughout his career (including the FIPRESCI prize, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, and the Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury) and winner of the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival for his debut film 'Ivan's Childhood'. In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the Soviet Union's prestigious Lenin Prize. Three of his films\u2014'Andrei RublevMirror', and 'Stalker'\u2014featured in 'Sight & Sound'\u2019s 2012 poll of the 50 greatest films of all time. ", "Andrei Rublev( Russian: \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0451\u0432) is a 1969 Soviet biographical historical drama film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and co-written with Andrei Konchalovsky. The film was remade and re-edited from the 1966 film titled' The Passion According to Andrei' by Tarkovsky which was censored during the first decade of the Brezhnev era in the Soviet Union. The film is loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, the 15th- century Russian icon painter. The film features Anatoly Solonitsyn, Nikolai Grinko, Ivan Lapikov, Nikolai Sergeyev, Nikolai Burlyayev and Tarkovsky's wife Irma Raush. Savva Yamshchikov, a famous Russian restorer and art historian, was a scientific consultant of the film. ' Andrei Rublev' is set against the background of 15th- century Russia. Although the film is only loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, it seeks to depict a realistic portrait of medieval Russia. Tarkovsky sought to create a film that shows the artist as' a world- historic figure' and' Christianity as an axiom of Russia's historical identity' during a turbulent period of Russian history that ultimately resulted in the Tsardom of Russia. The film's themes include artistic freedom, religion, political ambiguity, autodidacticism, and the making of art under a repressive regime. Because of this, it was not released domestically in the officially atheist Soviet Union for years after it was completed, except for a single 1966 screening in Moscow. A version of the film was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI prize. In 1971, a censored version of the film was released in the Soviet Union. The film was further cut for commercial reasons upon its U.S. release through Columbia Pictures in 1973. As a result, several versions of the film exist. Although these issues with censorship obscured and truncated the film for many years following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors as a highly original and accomplished work. Even more since being restored to its original version,' Andrei Rublev' has come to be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, and has often been ranked highly in both the' Sight& Sound' critics' and directors' polls.

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the 'King of Rock and Roll' or simply 'the King'. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel.

", "\u001b[92m[0] Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 \u2013 August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor.\u001b[0m Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the 'King of Rock and Roll' or simply 'the King'. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

That\u00a0Sunrise is still being praised by critics, however, speaks to the lasting artistic merits of the film and its impact on the development of the language of film.\u00a0 Cited at the first Academy Awards as the 'Best Unique and Artistic Achievement' in film, among 3 total awards, Sunrise was also overshadowed by Wings, which won the 'Best Picture' award, the only time 2 films were honored as the 'best' in any single year.\u00a0 That Sunrise was made at all, let alone in the manner in which it was made, can be directly linked to two men\u2019s creativity, ingenuity and determination to elevate the artistic nature of film.\u00a0 It also reflects a moment in time when both men, director F.W. Murnau and Fox Film Company head William Fox, reached for the pinnacle of their fields, only to be shatteringly brought back to earth, by poor decisions, bad timing and poor luck. Within four years of the film\u2019s release, one man would be dead and the other near bankrupt.\n", "George O\u2019Brien and Janet Gaynor starred in Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (also known as Sunrise), the 1927 silent romantic drama directed by German director F. W. Murnau (in his American film debut) that also features Margaret Livingston. (Auburn Cinefile Collection)\nSunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927). (IMDb.com)\n'Sunrise,' starring George O'Brien, Janet Gaynor, and Margaret Livingston, was released on September 23, 1927. Available from 20th Century Fox Studio Classics.\n", "While both William Fox and FW Murnau have been largely forgotten outside of film studies courses, their legacy of creating a unique and endearing piece of cinematic art cannot be understated.\u00a0 Without the drive of Fox to elevate his company artistically and Murnau\u2019s talent and perfectionism, Sunrise would never have been made.\u00a0 Murnau\u2019s genius took a simple story of betrayal and love and crafted a masterwork of style, emotion and wonder.\u00a0 Enjoying the five more than 95 years after its release is testament to its enduring quality and place among the greatest achievements in the quintessential artform of the 20th century.\u00a0*A final footnote.\u00a0 While William Fox was one of the early pioneers in archiving film as an artistic endeavor, even approaching congress for money for a national film archive, more than 90% of Fox Studios silent films were completely lost in a 1937 fire at their New Jersey warehouse, including Sunrise.\u00a0 As late as 2003 archivists from around the world were able to combine multiple pieces of existing materials to restore Sunrise to its glorious current state.\u00a0 2oth Century Fox, the company created in 1936 out of the near bankrupt ruins of William Fox\u2019s empire, partnered with the British Film Institute to restore the film for future generations.\n", "The film was not a success at the box office, however. It was overshadowed by The Jazz Singer, the first talkie, released only two weeks later. Sunrise used the Movietone system with sound recorded optically on the film itself. Sunrise only included music and sound effects, while the Warner Bros.\u2019s Jazz Singer included a couple of spoken dialogues. Sunrise, however, remains one of the high points of silent films, combining American-style storytelling with visual effects mostly seen (until then) in European films. Today it is considered one of the greatest films ever made.By January 1928 Fox had filmed ten vaudeville shorts and a part-talkie feature, Blossom Time. During the spring of 1928, these efforts, along with Fox's newsreels and Warners\u2019 shorts and part-talkies, proved to be the hits of the season. Thus, in May 1928 William Fox declared that 100 percent of the upcoming production schedule would be Movietone. Simultaneously Fox Film continued to wire, as quickly as possible, all the houses in its ever-expanding chain, and draw up plans for an all-sound Hollywood-based studio. Fox's innovation of sound neared completion; colossal profits loomed on the horizon. William Fox\u2019s vision and Theodore Case\u2019s tenacity and inventions changed the movie landscape forever. The ripple effect of their collaboration is still evident close to 100 years later.\n", "This audio-visual pun on the two sounds (and yes, there\u2019s a pun in audio-visual there) is perfectly timed and handled. The crash, and by extension the intertitle, interrupt George\u2019s suicide and thus save his life. Similarly, the audience, close to seeing their hero make such a grave and irreversible error, have the tension relieved with a wonderful gag that makes full use of the film\u2019s potential as a silent movie. It is a gag worthy of Chaplin himself.\n6. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) \u2013 The animation station\n", "After Sunrise Fox and his executives curtailed Murnau\u2019s freedom and he made 2 more films for the company, both of which were significantly altered from his version, with Four Devils now lost.\u00a0 After exiting his Fox contract, the director went to the South Pacific to work with renowned documentarian Robert Flaherty to direct Tabu, which secured distribution through Paramount for a US release.\u00a0 A week before its March 18h, 1931 premiere Murnau died after injuries sustained in a car accident.\u00a0 He was 42 years old.William Fox was able to overcome the financial setback of Sunrise and continued to push his innovative sound on film technology, as well as building and expanding his distribution network.\u00a0 By 1929 his empire was worth an estimated $300 million dollars and he had enough power to have a deal in place to buy all of the assets of Loews, the parent company of MGM Studios and all their associated theaters. He was at the mountain top of his industry, but it was short lived.\u00a0 A July 1929 automobile accident left him hospitalized and near death.\u00a0 As events of that fall began to take hold, it became apparent he had overextended himself financially and when banks called in his notes after the October Stock Market crash, Fox, still in his hospital bed, was left near penniless.\u00a0 He lost the MGM deal and in 1930 was forced to sell his empire for a mere $15 million dollars.\u00a0 He never made another film and by 1941 was actually sentenced to prison for bribing a judge, sealing his fate on the dustbin of history.\n", "When Murnau finally arrived in New York in July of 1926, he was feted by Fox, who promptly offered the director a four-year contract extension, with a salary elevating to $200,000 in the final year.\u00a0 The director agreed and headed off to California to scout for locations for the rural opening sequence of the film.\u00a0 In what would be a harbinger of things to come, Murnau decided that Lake Arrowhead would be the perfect setting for the country home of the farmer and his wife, but insisted that a small town be constructed across the lake from the already existing community.\u00a0 A robust $750,000 budget was assigned to the film and Fox granted Murnau complete freedom to cast whom he wanted and gave him access to the very best technicians on the Fox lot.At the time of her casting Janet Gaynor was a 20-year-old ing\u00e9nue with just four credited roles to her name, but already she was the top actress on the Fox lot.\u00a0 In films like The Johnstown Flood, The Shamrock Handicap and Midnight Kiss, all made in 1926, she had established herself as one of Hollywood\u2019s leading ladies.\u00a0 George O\u2019Brien, who would be cast as her husband, had been plucked from stuntman obscurity to star in John Ford\u2019s The Iron Horse in 1924 and quickly established his box office appeal in four subsequent Ford films.\u00a0 Both actors relied on more naturalistic acting styles that were evolving as silent film matured, with Gaynor endearing herself playing sweet innocent damsels and O\u2019Brien as a rugged, but sensitive tough guy.\u00a0 They were both perfect for Murnau, who liked his actors to convey feelings and actions without dramatic pantomime.Once photography began at the Lake Arrowhead location everyone involved realized this would be unlike any film they had worked on before.\u00a0 Murnau\u2019s attention to detail was unique among directors, particularly directors used to working in the Hollywood system of burn and turn camera takes.\u00a0 Instead, Murnau would often engage in as many as 20-30 takes of a single shot, sometimes waiting for light to reflect off a background object to capture the mood he wanted.\u00a0 While the crew and cast enjoyed Murnau\u2019s demeanor and meticulousness, the bean counters began to see a budget quickly escalating, but lacked the power to control it.\u00a0 When Murnau found a specific tree he wanted to use he had the tree chopped down, floated down the river to the shooting location and propped perfectly erect exactly where he wanted to shoot it.\u00a0 When the shock of the move caused the tree to lose all its leaves, Murnau simply ordered thousands of fake leave leaves shipped from Los Angeles and had craftsmen glue them onto the tree, a task which took nearly two weeks.\n", "Murnau\u2019s meticulousness extended well beyond how the shot looked to include how the actors moved and emoted.\u00a0 He added 15 pounds of weights to O\u2019Brien\u2019s shoes for the early scenes to give him a lumbering appearance and had him hunch his shoulders to affect the weight of the world resting upon them.\u00a0 Gaynor was made to look more homely by wearing a wig that pressed her hair tightly to her head and was shot to appear even smaller than her normal diminutive stature. \u00a0Her clothes are heavy and drab and compare poorly to the 'woman from the city's' sleek and shimmery black dress.Where Murnau\u2019s attention to detail was most pronounced, however, was in the production design and creation of the sets constructed once shooting moved back to the Fox lot in Los Angeles. Partnering with German compatriot Rochus Gliese, Murnau created a hyper reality, with a mile long trolly track, a great thoroughfare multiple buildings that stretch as far as the eye can see. Using forced perspective, where the lines in the distance converge on a false and exaggerated horizon to add depth, Murnau put smaller people and objects further back, finally having little people and toy cars at the back.\u00a0 The immense set was the largest ever constructed and cost more than $200,000 to build, but it gave Murnau the look and feel of chaos that he wanted to overwhelm the countryfolk.Two particular scenes perfectly illustrate what Murnau was after and how he executed it on screen.\u00a0 The first is the scene between the husband and his lover in the marsh.\u00a0 The siren call of the mistress lures the man out towards the lake, leaving his wife alone at home to imagine their bucolic former lives. As full moon appears over a fog covered march as the man trudges towards his mistress, the camera following him as he moves through bushes and trees, almost in a circle, as he finally moves straight towards the camera itself.\u00a0 The camera spins on its axis to move from the man\u2019s perspective, resting on the mistress as she powders her nose, the moon above her providing her a vanity light.\u00a0 The man appears, with only the moon between them, they embrace and madly kiss.\u00a0 Told entirely in images, the scene captures all the emotion, dread and longing that sets the story in motion and is unlike anything in silent film in the fluid and effortless nature of the camera movement.\u00a0 The viewer is the voyeur, floating at the edge of the scene, but never intruding into it.\u00a0 It\u2019s stunning camera work by Charles Rosher and Karl Straus, designed eloquently by Murnau to bring the viewer into the story\n", "Murnau (again) directed his version of the 19th Century German legend in 1926; his last film before leaving for Hollywood to make Sunrise. An alternative take on the story of Job, Faust is about a man led astray by the devil, in the guise of the demon Mephisto (a wonderfully over-the-top Emil Jannings). Faust (G\u00f6sta Ekman) falls victim to Mephisto after the demon bets an Archangel (Werner Fuetterer) that he can destroy all the good in a man.\nIn the end, it seems Mephisto has succeeded. Faust is made miserable by the Devil\u2019s plans and in the end throws himself on a pyre to burn with his beloved. But as Mephisto claims victory, the Archangel tells him he has in fact lost the bet, because of the power of one word. Mephisto demands to know the word, and in a fit of light worthy of the Stargate in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the word 'Liebe', or 'Love', flies straight at the screen, practically punching the audience in the face with its glory!\n", "Curt Siodmak maintains that the first 5,000 marks of the 9,000-mark (roughly $2,500 US at the time) eventual total production cost of\u00a0People on Sunday\u00a0came from his own pocket. 'I had sold my first serial novel to the\u00a0Woche\u00a0magazine, which paid very well,' he said. 'I gave Robert an idea and 5,000 marks to start.' Robert Siodmak and Billy Wilder claimed that they borrowed the money from the Siodmaks\u2019 uncle, producer Heinrich Nebenzhal. Edgar Ulmer (whom, it bears mentioning, has been called 'film history\u2019s biggest liar' by Lotte Eisner) insisted in an interview in Peter Bogdanovich\u2019s\u00a0Who the Devil Made It, that he set the film up with his own money. 'I organized it,' Ulmer told Bogdanovich. 'I had five thousand dollars which I had brought from America.'\n", "Raymond Longford( 23 September 18782 April 1959) was a prolific Australian film director, writer, producer and actor during the silent era.

Available from 20th Century Fox Studio Classics.\n", "While both William Fox and FW Murnau have been largely forgotten outside of film studies courses, their legacy of creating a unique and endearing piece of cinematic art cannot be understated.\u00a0 Without the drive of Fox to elevate his company artistically and Murnau\u2019s talent and perfectionism, Sunrise would never have been made.\u00a0 Murnau\u2019s genius took a simple story of betrayal and love and crafted a masterwork of style, emotion and wonder.\u00a0 Enjoying the five more than 95 years after its release is testament to its enduring quality and place among the greatest achievements in the quintessential artform of the 20th century.\u00a0*A final footnote.\u00a0 While William Fox was one of the early pioneers in archiving film as an artistic endeavor, even approaching congress for money for a national film archive, more than 90% of Fox Studios silent films were completely lost in a 1937 fire at their New Jersey warehouse, including Sunrise.\u00a0 As late as 2003 archivists from around the world were able to combine multiple pieces of existing materials to restore Sunrise to its glorious current state.\u00a0 2oth Century Fox, the company created in 1936 out of the near bankrupt ruins of William Fox\u2019s empire, partnered with the British Film Institute to restore the film for future generations.\n", "The film was not a success at the box office, however. It was overshadowed by The Jazz Singer, the first talkie, released only two weeks later. Sunrise used the Movietone system with sound recorded optically on the film itself. Sunrise only included music and sound effects, while the Warner Bros.\u2019s Jazz Singer included a couple of spoken dialogues. Sunrise, however, remains one of the high points of silent films, combining American-style storytelling with visual effects mostly seen (until then) in European films. Today it is considered one of the greatest films ever made.By January 1928 Fox had filmed ten vaudeville shorts and a part-talkie feature, Blossom Time. During the spring of 1928, these efforts, along with Fox's newsreels and Warners\u2019 shorts and part-talkies, proved to be the hits of the season. Thus, in May 1928 William Fox declared that 100 percent of the upcoming production schedule would be Movietone. Simultaneously Fox Film continued to wire, as quickly as possible, all the houses in its ever-expanding chain, and draw up plans for an all-sound Hollywood-based studio. Fox's innovation of sound neared completion; colossal profits loomed on the horizon. William Fox\u2019s vision and Theodore Case\u2019s tenacity and inventions changed the movie landscape forever. The ripple effect of their collaboration is still evident close to 100 years later.\n", "This audio-visual pun on the two sounds (and yes, there\u2019s a pun in audio-visual there) is perfectly timed and handled. The crash, and by extension the intertitle, interrupt George\u2019s suicide and thus save his life. Similarly, the audience, close to seeing their hero make such a grave and irreversible error, have the tension relieved with a wonderful gag that makes full use of the film\u2019s potential as a silent movie. It is a gag worthy of Chaplin himself.\n6. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) \u2013 The animation station\n", "After Sunrise Fox and his executives curtailed Murnau\u2019s freedom and he made 2 more films for the company, both of which were significantly altered from his version, with Four Devils now lost.\u00a0 After exiting his Fox contract, the director went to the South Pacific to work with renowned documentarian Robert Flaherty to direct Tabu, which secured distribution through Paramount for a US release.\u00a0 A week before its March 18h, 1931 premiere Murnau died after injuries sustained in a car accident.\u00a0 He was 42 years old.William Fox was able to overcome the financial setback of Sunrise and continued to push his innovative sound on film technology, as well as building and expanding his distribution network.\u00a0 By 1929 his empire was worth an estimated $300 million dollars and he had enough power to have a deal in place to buy all of the assets of Loews, the parent company of MGM Studios and all their associated theaters. He was at the mountain top of his industry, but it was short lived.\u00a0 A July 1929 automobile accident left him hospitalized and near death.\u00a0 As events of that fall began to take hold, it became apparent he had overextended himself financially and when banks called in his notes after the October Stock Market crash, Fox, still in his hospital bed, was left near penniless.\u00a0 He lost the MGM deal and in 1930 was forced to sell his empire for a mere $15 million dollars.\u00a0 He never made another film and by 1941 was actually sentenced to prison for bribing a judge, sealing his fate on the dustbin of history.\n", "When Murnau finally arrived in New York in July of 1926, he was feted by Fox, who promptly offered the director a four-year contract extension, with a salary elevating to $200,000 in the final year.\u00a0 The director agreed and headed off to California to scout for locations for the rural opening sequence of the film.\u00a0 In what would be a harbinger of things to come, Murnau decided that Lake Arrowhead would be the perfect setting for the country home of the farmer and his wife, but insisted that a small town be constructed across the lake from the already existing community.\u00a0 A robust $750,000 budget was assigned to the film and Fox granted Murnau complete freedom to cast whom he wanted and gave him access to the very best technicians on the Fox lot.At the time of her casting Janet Gaynor was a 20-year-old ing\u00e9nue with just four credited roles to her name, but already she was the top actress on the Fox lot.\u00a0 In films like The Johnstown Flood, The Shamrock Handicap and Midnight Kiss, all made in 1926, she had established herself as one of Hollywood\u2019s leading ladies.\u00a0 George O\u2019Brien, who would be cast as her husband, had been plucked from stuntman obscurity to star in John Ford\u2019s The Iron Horse in 1924 and quickly established his box office appeal in four subsequent Ford films.\u00a0 Both actors relied on more naturalistic acting styles that were evolving as silent film matured, with Gaynor endearing herself playing sweet innocent damsels and O\u2019Brien as a rugged, but sensitive tough guy.\u00a0 They were both perfect for Murnau, who liked his actors to convey feelings and actions without dramatic pantomime.Once photography began at the Lake Arrowhead location everyone involved realized this would be unlike any film they had worked on before.\u00a0 Murnau\u2019s attention to detail was unique among directors, particularly directors used to working in the Hollywood system of burn and turn camera takes.\u00a0 Instead, Murnau would often engage in as many as 20-30 takes of a single shot, sometimes waiting for light to reflect off a background object to capture the mood he wanted.\u00a0 While the crew and cast enjoyed Murnau\u2019s demeanor and meticulousness, the bean counters began to see a budget quickly escalating, but lacked the power to control it.\u00a0 When Murnau found a specific tree he wanted to use he had the tree chopped down, floated down the river to the shooting location and propped perfectly erect exactly where he wanted to shoot it.\u00a0 When the shock of the move caused the tree to lose all its leaves, Murnau simply ordered thousands of fake leave leaves shipped from Los Angeles and had craftsmen glue them onto the tree, a task which took nearly two weeks.\n", "Murnau\u2019s meticulousness extended well beyond how the shot looked to include how the actors moved and emoted.\u00a0 He added 15 pounds of weights to O\u2019Brien\u2019s shoes for the early scenes to give him a lumbering appearance and had him hunch his shoulders to affect the weight of the world resting upon them.\u00a0 Gaynor was made to look more homely by wearing a wig that pressed her hair tightly to her head and was shot to appear even smaller than her normal diminutive stature. \u00a0Her clothes are heavy and drab and compare poorly to the 'woman from the city's' sleek and shimmery black dress.Where Murnau\u2019s attention to detail was most pronounced, however, was in the production design and creation of the sets constructed once shooting moved back to the Fox lot in Los Angeles. Partnering with German compatriot Rochus Gliese, Murnau created a hyper reality, with a mile long trolly track, a great thoroughfare multiple buildings that stretch as far as the eye can see. Using forced perspective, where the lines in the distance converge on a false and exaggerated horizon to add depth, Murnau put smaller people and objects further back, finally having little people and toy cars at the back.\u00a0 The immense set was the largest ever constructed and cost more than $200,000 to build, but it gave Murnau the look and feel of chaos that he wanted to overwhelm the countryfolk.Two particular scenes perfectly illustrate what Murnau was after and how he executed it on screen.\u00a0 The first is the scene between the husband and his lover in the marsh.\u00a0 The siren call of the mistress lures the man out towards the lake, leaving his wife alone at home to imagine their bucolic former lives. As full moon appears over a fog covered march as the man trudges towards his mistress, the camera following him as he moves through bushes and trees, almost in a circle, as he finally moves straight towards the camera itself.\u00a0 The camera spins on its axis to move from the man\u2019s perspective, resting on the mistress as she powders her nose, the moon above her providing her a vanity light.\u00a0 The man appears, with only the moon between them, they embrace and madly kiss.\u00a0 Told entirely in images, the scene captures all the emotion, dread and longing that sets the story in motion and is unlike anything in silent film in the fluid and effortless nature of the camera movement.\u00a0 The viewer is the voyeur, floating at the edge of the scene, but never intruding into it.\u00a0 It\u2019s stunning camera work by Charles Rosher and Karl Straus, designed eloquently by Murnau to bring the viewer into the story\n", "Murnau (again) directed his version of the 19th Century German legend in 1926; his last film before leaving for Hollywood to make Sunrise. An alternative take on the story of Job, Faust is about a man led astray by the devil, in the guise of the demon Mephisto (a wonderfully over-the-top Emil Jannings). Faust (G\u00f6sta Ekman) falls victim to Mephisto after the demon bets an Archangel (Werner Fuetterer) that he can destroy all the good in a man.\nIn the end, it seems Mephisto has succeeded. Faust is made miserable by the Devil\u2019s plans and in the end throws himself on a pyre to burn with his beloved. But as Mephisto claims victory, the Archangel tells him he has in fact lost the bet, because of the power of one word. Mephisto demands to know the word, and in a fit of light worthy of the Stargate in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the word 'Liebe', or 'Love', flies straight at the screen, practically punching the audience in the face with its glory!\n", "Curt Siodmak maintains that the first 5,000 marks of the 9,000-mark (roughly $2,500 US at the time) eventual total production cost of\u00a0People on Sunday\u00a0came from his own pocket. 'I had sold my first serial novel to the\u00a0Woche\u00a0magazine, which paid very well,' he said. 'I gave Robert an idea and 5,000 marks to start.' Robert Siodmak and Billy Wilder claimed that they borrowed the money from the Siodmaks\u2019 uncle, producer Heinrich Nebenzhal. Edgar Ulmer (whom, it bears mentioning, has been called 'film history\u2019s biggest liar' by Lotte Eisner) insisted in an interview in Peter Bogdanovich\u2019s\u00a0Who the Devil Made It, that he set the film up with his own money. 'I organized it,' Ulmer told Bogdanovich. 'I had five thousand dollars which I had brought from America.'\n", "Raymond Longford( 23 September 18782 April 1959) was a prolific Australian film director, writer, producer and actor during the silent era.

In 1922 he toured with Fess Williams, and formed his own group, the Blue Grass Buddies, in Ohio in 1924. In 1925 he played with Lois Deppe, and later in the decade led the groups Eight Black Pirates and the Symphonic Harmonists. From 1931 to 1936 Hayes played in and arranged for the Mills Blue Rhythm Band. From 1937 to 1941 Hayes again led his own orchestra; Kenny Clarke was among his sidemen. His most popular recording was a version of the song' Stardust' and the original recording of' In the Mood' which was later covered by Glenn Miller, both songs were recorded in 1938. He moved to California in 1942, and led a quartet there for most of the decade. Following this he played solo, continuing to perform live into the 1970s. Hayes recorded under his own name in 1937- 38, 1946, 1947, 1948, and 1960. He died in San Bernardino, California, in 1979.

After he is released and falls back into a life of temptation, he is saved by the love of a woman and the warden who befriended him. The film received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Director in 1930. ' Weary River' was preserved at the Library of Congress and restored by the LoC, UCLA Film and Television Archive, and Warner Bros. It is available on DVD directly from the Warner Archive Collection. While Barthelmess's character sings and plays the piano throughout the film, Barthelmess did not sing or play the piano. Frank Churchill played the piano, and Johnny Murray sang into a microphone far away from Barthelmess while he lip-synced and played a piano that had strings deadened with felt.

", "George Harrison (25 February 1943 \u2013 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called 'the quiet Beatle', Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included 'TaxmanWithin You Without YouWhile My Guitar Gently WeepsHere Comes the Sun' and 'Something'. Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on 'Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)'. Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album 'All Things Must Pass', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, 'My Sweet Lord', and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978. Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. ' Rolling Stone' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the '100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time'. He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004. Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his Friar Park home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost \u00a3100 million.

As a director, Vasan was known for his grandiose sets and innovative techniques that he introduced. Film historian Randor Guy hailed Vasan as the 'Cecil B. De Mille of India'.

", "Jacques Rivette (1 March 1928 \u2013 29 January 2016) was a French film director and film critic most commonly associated with the French New Wave and the film magazine 'Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma'. He made twenty-nine films, including 'L'amour fou' (1969), 'Out 1' (1971), 'Celine and Julie Go Boating' (1974), and 'La Belle Noiseuse' (1991). His work is noted for its improvisation, loose narratives, and lengthy running times. Inspired by Jean Cocteau to become a filmmaker, Rivette shot his first short film at age twenty. He moved to Paris to pursue his career, frequenting Henri Langlois' Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise and other cin\u00e9-clubs; there, he met Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, \u00c9ric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol and other future members of the New Wave. Rivette began writing film criticism, and was hired by Andr\u00e9 Bazin for 'Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma' in 1953. In his criticism, he expressed an admiration for American films \u2013 especially those of genre directors such as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray \u2013 and was deeply critical of mainstream French cinema. Rivette's articles, admired by his peers, were considered the magazine's best and most aggressive writings, particularly his 1961 article 'On Abjection' and his influential series of interviews with film directors co-written with Truffaut. He continued making short films, including 'Le Coup de Berger', which is often cited as the first New Wave film. Truffaut later credited Rivette with developing the movement. Although he was the first New Wave director to begin work on a feature film, 'Paris Belongs to Us' was not released until 1961, by which time Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard released their own first features and popularised the movement worldwide. Rivette became editor of 'Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma' during the early 1960s and publicly fought French censorship of his second feature film, 'The Nun' (1966). He then re-evaluated his career, developing a unique cinematic style with 'L'amour fou'. Influenced by the political turmoil of May 68, improvisational theatre and an in-depth interview with filmmaker Jean Renoir, Rivette began working with large groups of actors on character development and allowing events to unfold on camera. This technique led to the thirteen-hour 'Out 1' which, although rarely screened, is considered a Holy Grail of cinephiles. His films of the 1970s, such as 'Celine and Julie Go Boating', often incorporated fantasy and were better-regarded. After attempting to make four consecutive films, however, Rivette had a nervous breakdown and his career slowed for several years. During the early 1980s, he began a business partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette's output increased from then on, and his film 'La Belle Noiseuse' received international praise. He retired after completing 'Around a Small Mountain' (2009), and it was revealed three years later that he had Alzheimer's disease. Very private about his personal life, Rivette was briefly married to photographer and screenwriter Maril\u00f9 Parolini during the early 1960s and later married V\u00e9ronique Manniez.

{"ID": 307, "All Sources": ["As Zappa's art matured, his influences weren't as blatantly evident, but it's interesting to hear.\nLumpy Gravy 7\n( 1968 )\nPart One / Part Two\nThere's something people often miss about this record. Some of my fellow reviewers refuse to even acknowledge this as music, but if it's not music, what else is it? This is a SCORED ORCHESTRAL PIECE! OK, it's avant-garde, it's certainly not easy and the spoken dialogue and speech parts seem to make no coherent sense. But then, this is Zappa. But, hang on for a second. Frank had no kind of audience awaiting this release. The first two Mothers albums had sold well enough, but certainly neither were anything remotely resembling a best-seller, or enough to give Frank recognition beyond the underground scene. So, 'Lumpy Gravy'? Well, let's just see here....\n0:00 - 0:05 : 'The Way I See It Barry, this should be a very dynamite show'\n0:06 - 1:37 : Very fast, typically Zappa instrumental music that sounds like a low-budget TV theme tune.\n", "5 As with Lumpy Gravy, disagreement exists about the release of We're Only in It for the Money: reported dates in published sources range from December 1967 to September 1968. Some confusion may have arisen here owing to MGM/Verve's apparent withdrawal of the album after its initial release, followed by its re-release with further objectionable lyrics censored. Thus it is likely that the earlier date is the more accurate one, and that therefore the Mothers of Invention had three albums out by the time Lumpy Gravy appeared.\n6 See 'My Favorite Album' (Zappa interview excerpt, 22 October 1971, KBEY-FM, Kansas City), Lumpy Money, Disc III, Track 7, in which one of Zappa's interlocutors mentions his frustration at not being able to locate a copy of Lumpy Gravy to purchase after months of searching.\n", "39 Zappa, Civilization Phaze III, liner notes, 2\u20133. The mention of 'Evelyn, a Modified Dog' is a typical self-reference. See the album One Size Fits All (1975) for the song by that title. The mention of autumn 1966\u2014meant here to identify only the date of the orchestral recording sessions, by the way\u2014is definitely inaccurate in its exclusion of later recording dates (the Capitol sessions of February and March 1967), although it is possible that some material was recorded earlier\u2014even earlier than autumn 1966, as discussed above (in particular, the overture and finale to Lumpy Gravy, which are absent from the putative Capitol master). The razor-blade edits for the final version of Lumpy Gravy must have been done at Apostolic and/or Mayfair, since much of the material was not recorded until Zappa was in New York and working at those studios.\n", "Abstract Among the vast recorded output of Frank Zappa's remarkable career, two albums\u2014the very early Lumpy Gravy (1968) and the posthumously released Civilization Phaze III (1994)\u2014have special significance, not only for their great originality but also for the conceptual link between them. A close examination of these works, together with recently issued audio-archival material that provides a basis for conjecture about the genesis of Lumpy Gravy, reveals much about Zappa's unique position in the realms of popular and art music as he negotiated the boundary between them. It also shows how and to what extent Zappa embraced an avant-garde aesthetic in Lumpy Gravy, his first solo album, and how this orientation was abandoned yet also, in a way, echoed in Civilization Phaze III.\nType\nResearch Article\nInformation\nJournal of the Society for American Music\n,\nVolume 5\n,\nIssue 1\n, February 2011 , pp. 1 - 31\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S1752196310000490\n[Opens in a new window]\nCopyright\n", "13 Kempton, 'Zappa and the Mothers,' 276.\n14 Zappa, lecture at the New School, New York, 21 February 1969; transcribed from recording titled 'Lumpy Gravy \u2018Shuffle,\u2019' Lumpy Money, Disc III, Track 2.\n15 See Jerry Hopkins, 'Frank Zappa' (interview, 1968), in The Rolling Stone Interviews, 2 vols.

Some of my fellow reviewers refuse to even acknowledge this as music, but if it's not music, what else is it? This is a SCORED ORCHESTRAL PIECE! OK, it's avant-garde, it's certainly not easy and the spoken dialogue and speech parts seem to make no coherent sense. But then, this is Zappa. But, hang on for a second. Frank had no kind of audience awaiting this release. The first two Mothers albums had sold well enough, but certainly neither were anything remotely resembling a best-seller, or enough to give Frank recognition beyond the underground scene. So, 'Lumpy Gravy'? Well, let's just see here....\n0:00 - 0:05 : 'The Way I See It Barry, this should be a very dynamite show'\n0:06 - 1:37 : Very fast, typically Zappa instrumental music that sounds like a low-budget TV theme tune.\n", "5 As with Lumpy Gravy, disagreement exists about the release of We're Only in It for the Money: reported dates in published sources range from December 1967 to September 1968. Some confusion may have arisen here owing to MGM/Verve's apparent withdrawal of the album after its initial release, followed by its re-release with further objectionable lyrics censored. Thus it is likely that the earlier date is the more accurate one, and that therefore the Mothers of Invention had three albums out by the time Lumpy Gravy appeared.\n6 See 'My Favorite Album' (Zappa interview excerpt, 22 October 1971, KBEY-FM, Kansas City), Lumpy Money, Disc III, Track 7, in which one of Zappa's interlocutors mentions his frustration at not being able to locate a copy of Lumpy Gravy to purchase after months of searching.\n", "39 Zappa, Civilization Phaze III, liner notes, 2\u20133. The mention of 'Evelyn, a Modified Dog' is a typical self-reference. See the album One Size Fits All (1975) for the song by that title. The mention of autumn 1966\u2014meant here to identify only the date of the orchestral recording sessions, by the way\u2014is definitely inaccurate in its exclusion of later recording dates (the Capitol sessions of February and March 1967), although it is possible that some material was recorded earlier\u2014even earlier than autumn 1966, as discussed above (in particular, the overture and finale to Lumpy Gravy, which are absent from the putative Capitol master). The razor-blade edits for the final version of Lumpy Gravy must have been done at Apostolic and/or Mayfair, since much of the material was not recorded until Zappa was in New York and working at those studios.\n", "Abstract Among the vast recorded output of Frank Zappa's remarkable career, two albums\u2014the very early Lumpy Gravy (1968) and the posthumously released Civilization Phaze III (1994)\u2014have special significance, not only for their great originality but also for the conceptual link between them. A close examination of these works, together with recently issued audio-archival material that provides a basis for conjecture about the genesis of Lumpy Gravy, reveals much about Zappa's unique position in the realms of popular and art music as he negotiated the boundary between them. It also shows how and to what extent Zappa embraced an avant-garde aesthetic in Lumpy Gravy, his first solo album, and how this orientation was abandoned yet also, in a way, echoed in Civilization Phaze III.\nType\nResearch Article\nInformation\nJournal of the Society for American Music\n,\nVolume 5\n,\nIssue 1\n, February 2011 , pp. 1 - 31\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S1752196310000490\n[Opens in a new window]\nCopyright\n", "13 Kempton, 'Zappa and the Mothers,' 276.\n14 Zappa, lecture at the New School, New York, 21 February 1969; transcribed from recording titled 'Lumpy Gravy \u2018Shuffle,\u2019' Lumpy Money, Disc III, Track 2.\n15 See Jerry Hopkins, 'Frank Zappa' (interview, 1968), in The Rolling Stone Interviews, 2 vols.

He was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou and the only son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno. His father was the eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary. She laid claim to Hungary after her brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, died in 1290, but the Hungarian prelates and lords elected her cousin, Andrew III, king. Instead of abandoning her claim to Hungary, she transferred it to her son, Charles Martel, and after his death in 1295, to her grandson, Charles. On the other hand, her husband, Charles II of Naples, made their third son, Robert, heir to the Kingdom of Naples, thus disinheriting Charles. Charles came to the Kingdom of Hungary upon the invitation of an influential Croatian lord, Paul \u0160ubi\u0107, in August 1300. Andrew III died on 14 January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had no central government, the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch. One of those oligarchs, Ladislaus III K\u00e1n, captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307. Charles was elected king in Pest on 27 November 1308, but his rule remained nominal in most parts of his kingdom even after he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27 August 1310. Charles won his first decisive victory in the Battle of Rozgony (at present-day Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15 June 1312. After that his troops seized most fortresses of the powerful Aba family. During the next decade, Charles restored royal power primarily with the assistance of the prelates and lesser noblemen in most regions of the kingdom. After the death of the most powerful oligarch, Matthew Cs\u00e1k, in 1321, Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom, with the exception of Croatia where local noblemen were able to preserve their autonomous status. He was not able to hinder the development of Wallachia into an independent principality after his defeat in the Battle of Posada in 1330. Charles's contemporaries described his defeat in that battle as a punishment from God for his cruel revenge against the family of Felician Z\u00e1h who had attempted to slaughter the royal family. Charles rarely made perpetual land grants, instead introducing a system of 'office fiefs', whereby his officials enjoyed significant revenues, but only for the time they held a royal office, which ensured their loyalty. In the second half of his reign, Charles did not hold Diets and administered his kingdom with absolute power. He established the Order of Saint George, which was the first secular order of knights. He promoted the opening of new gold mines, which made Hungary the largest producer of gold in Europe. The first Hungarian gold coins were minted during his reign. At the congress of Visegr\u00e1d in 1335, he mediated a reconciliation between two neighboring monarchs, John of Bohemia and Casimir III of Poland. Treaties signed at the same congress also contributed to the development of new commercial routes linking Hungary with Western Europe. Charles's efforts to reunite Hungary, together with his administrative and economic reforms, established the basis for the achievements of his successor, Louis the Great.

He was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou and the only son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno. His father was the eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary. She laid claim to Hungary after her brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, died in 1290, but the Hungarian prelates and lords elected her cousin, Andrew III, king. Instead of abandoning her claim to Hungary, she transferred it to her son, Charles Martel, and after his death in 1295, to her grandson, Charles. On the other hand, her husband, Charles II of Naples, made their third son, Robert, heir to the Kingdom of Naples, thus disinheriting Charles. Charles came to the Kingdom of Hungary upon the invitation of an influential Croatian lord, Paul \u0160ubi\u0107, in August 1300. Andrew III died on 14 January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305.

Scott, Martin Landau, James Drury and Robert Vaughn were being considered for the lead, but Ray Danton won the part and is well cast in the role.

Karen Steele, who plays Diamond's long-suffering mistress and eventual wife, was romantically involved with Boetticher at the time of filming though their volatile relationship would end after the making of this film.

Waylon Jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song ' It's AlrightIf we all could sound like we wanted to, we'd all sound like George Jones. ' The shape of his nose and facial features earned Jones the nickname 'The Possum'. Born in Texas, Jones first heard country music when he was seven and was given a guitar at the age of nine. He married his first wife, Dorothy Bonvillion, in 1950, and was divorced in 1951. He served in the United States Marine Corps and was discharged in 1953. He married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. In 1959, Jones recorded 'White Lightning', written by J. P. Richardson, which launched his career as a singer. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1968; he married fellow country music singer Tammy Wynette a year later. Years of alcoholism compromised his health and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname 'No Show Jones'. After his divorce from Wynette in 1975, Jones married his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvado, in 1983 and became sober for good in 1999. Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure. During his career, Jones had more than 150 hits, both as a solo artist and in duets with other artists. Robert Christgau has called him 'honky-tonk's greatest honky'.

'Mandisa loved Jesus, and she used her unusually extensive platform to talk about Him at every turn,' said David Pierce, K-Love chief media officer. 'Her kindness was epic, her smile electric, her voice massive, but it was no match for the size of her heart.' Pierce continued, 'Mandisa struggled, and she was vulnerable enough to share that with us, which helped us talk about our own struggles \u2026 Mandisa\u2019s struggles are over.

The song was released as the b-side to the #4 hit Why Baby Why in 1955. The song was also recorded by Johnny Cash and, released in 1960, it became a #10 hit. The song was one of Jones' best early ballads, included on many of his early studio and compilation albums with Starday and Mercury Records in the late 1950s. The song was even included on his debut 1957 album The Grand Ole Opry's New Star, which was Starday's first album release in the label's history. ", "George Glenn Jones (September 12, 1931 \u2013 April 26, 2013) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He achieved international fame for his long list of hit records, including his best-known song ' He Stopped Loving Her Today', as well as his distinctive voice and phrasing. For the last twenty years of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer. Country music scholar Bill Malone writes, 'For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.'

His documentary Polizones en Nueva Colonia (1991) received the Simon Bolivar Journalism Award in the television category.\n", "Gaviria\u2019s third feature marks a return to a style defined in his first two widely successful films. He burst onto the Colombian film scene in 1990 with Rodrigo D: No Futuro, which follows a teenage boy who becomes a sicario (assassin) for the Medell\u00edn Cartel. Despite his passion for music in an emerging punk culture in late 1980s, the protagonist is unable to break away from the cycle of poverty and violence. Gaviria\u2019s debut was well received internationally and was selected for official competition at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival in France.\nHis second film released in 1998, La Vendedora de Rosas, was also screened at Cannes, and received even more accolades. Again set in Colombia\u2019s second largest city, the film follows a young girl who lives in the street, selling flowers in nightclubs and is prematurely ushered into a world of vices, drugs, and prostitution.\n", "V\u00edctor Manuel Gaviria, born in Medellin, has served as a director, screenwriter, poet, and author. His films have won numerous international accolades and have been selected for some of the most prestigious festivals in the world, including Cannes and the San Sebastian Film Festival. Gaviria studied psychology at the University of Antioquia because he 'wanted to feel the soul of words.' He also wrote poetry, and published Con los que viajo sue\u00f1o (1978) and won the Eduardo Cote Lamus National Poetry Contest (1978) for Alguien en la ciudad tambi\u00e9n perplejo. At age 25, he won the Universidad de Antioquia National Poetry Prize for La luna y la ducha fr\u00eda (1979). He began to explore other genres to express the same questions about everyday metaphysics, leading him to write the poetic essay El campo al fin de cuentas no es tan verde (1983). In 1986, he collected selections of his poetry, essays, and screenplays in the anthology El pulso del cart\u00f3grafo. His later projects include El rey de los espantos (1993), scripts, other books of poetry, and films.\n", "La vendedora de rosas is a 1998 Colombian film directed by V\u00edctor Gaviria. The film is loosely based on the fairy tale 'The Little Match Girl' by Hans Christian Andersen; it was entered into the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. The film was selected as the Colombian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. Many of the actors that starred in the film are now dead or in prison. Giovanni Quiroz was murdered in Medell\u00edn and Leidy Tabares was incarcerated for her involvement in the murder of a taxi driver in Medell\u00edn. Elkin Giovanny Rodriguez (Don Hector in the film) and Alex Bedoya (Milton) are dead now. Some of them are still alive but living in tough conditions, such as Mileider Gil, who entered the world of prostitution a few years after the film was finished. ", "V\u00edctor Manuel Gaviria Gonz\u00e1lez (born January 19, 1955, in Liborina, Antioquia, Colombia) is a film director, writer, and poet. His three feature-length films are highly acclaimed and have won many international awards. He is the first Colombian filmmaker to be featured at the Cannes Film Festival in France. He is often recognized as the most influential and well-known filmmaker to come out of Colombia, often being considered an exception to Colombian Cinema.

Dubbed the 'King of Pop', he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers in the history of music. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. He began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and rose to solo stardom with 'Off the Wall' (1979). By the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for 'Beat ItBillie Jean', and 'Thriller' from his 1982 album 'Thriller', are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Their popularity helped bring the television channel MTV to fame. Jackson continued to innovate throughout the 1990s with videos such as 'Black or White' and 'Scream', and forged a reputation as a touring artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized complicated dance techniques such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres. Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide. All five albums he released between 1979 and 1995, including 'Dangerous' (1991) and  (1995), rank among the world's best-selling. 'Thriller' is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 66 million copies worldwide. 'Bad' (1987) was the first album to produce five 'Billboard' Hot 100 number-one singles. He won hundreds of awards (more than any other artist in the history of popular music), has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, and is the only pop or rock artist to have been inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame. His other achievements include a record 39 'Guinness World Records' (including the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time), 15 Grammy Awards (including the Legend and Lifetime Achievement awards), 26 American Music Awards, and 13 'Billboard' Hot 100 number-one singles (more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era). Jackson was the first artist to have a top ten single in the 'Billboard' Hot 100 in five different decades. In 2016, Jackson's estate earned $825 million, the highest yearly amount for a celebrity ever recorded by 'Forbes'. In the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy for his changing appearance, relationships, behavior and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Jackson was not indicted. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. In 2009, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, 'This Is It', Jackson died from an overdose of sedatives administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray. Fans around the world expressed their grief, and Jackson's public memorial service was broadcast live. The 2019 documentary 'Leaving Neverland' detailed posthumous allegations of child sexual abuse, leading to an international backlash against Jackson.

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the 'King of Rock and Roll' or simply 'the King'. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

The works themselves are often absurdist comedies that feature actress, co- writer, stylist, and wife, Amy Davis. Perhaps best known for his cult film' Mod Fuck Explosion', Moritsugu's films have been screened at Sundance, Cannes, Berlin, Toronto, Rotterdam, Venice, New York Underground, Chicago Underground, MoMA, Guggenheim, Whitney and numerous other festivals and museums.

After her return, she released another short film and her feature film debut,' The Art of Woo'( 2001). She continues to produce short films, although at a reduced rate.

Influenced by the nihilism of Jean- Luc Godard and Guy Debord, Moritsugu's films are often defined by their' lo- fi' aesthetic and were initially shot on 16 mm film for a gritty, visceral quality. He states that he often' pay( s) less attention to narrative flow and storyline and put( s) more emphasis on sight, sound and spectacle' to create a movie that is' like a live punk/ hardcore show.' The works themselves are often absurdist comedies that feature actress, co- writer, stylist, and wife, Amy Davis. Perhaps best known for his cult film' Mod Fuck Explosion', Moritsugu's films have been screened at Sundance, Cannes, Berlin, Toronto, Rotterdam, Venice, New York Underground, Chicago Underground, MoMA, Guggenheim, Whitney and numerous other festivals and museums. In 2001 he received the Moving Image award from Creative Capital. ", "Helen Lee( born c. 1965) is a Korean- Canadian film director. Born in Seoul, South Korea, she emigrated to Canada at the age of four and grew up in Scarborough, Ontario. Interested in film at a young age, she took film studies at the University of Toronto and, later, New York University. While in university she was influenced by gender and minority theories, as reflected in her first film, the short' Sally's Beauty Spot'( 1990). While continuing her studies she produced two more films before taking a five- year hiatus to live in Korea beginning in 1995. After her return, she released another short film and her feature film debut,' The Art of Woo'( 2001). She continues to produce short films, although at a reduced rate. Lee's films often deal with gender and racial issues, reflecting the state of East Asians in modern society; a common theme in her work is sexuality, with several films featuring interracial relationships.

Ik ben fan van de 'Before'-trilogie. Before sunrise, Before sunset en Before midnight, drie films die de geschiedenis van een koppel volgen. Babbelfilms die puur om dialogen draaien. En ik was dan ook niet echt verbaasd toen ik achteraf zag dat deze film van dezelfde regisseur is. In 'Boyhood' gebeurt ook niet veel. Behalve dan dat je een kleine jongen ziet opgroeien tot hij 18 is. Mijn schoonvader sprong na afloop van de film recht en riep ontgoocheld uit: 'Dat ging nu echt over helemaal niks!'\nEn voor mij ging het over alles. Over het leven hoe het werkelijk is. Waarin nauwelijks iets gebeurt. De moeder van de jongen jammert op een bepaald moment: 'Ik had gewoon m\u00e9\u00e9r verwacht'.\nIs dit de beste film van 2014 zoals nogal wat Amerikaanse critici beweren?\n", "Ik wil voor de rest van men leven van je houwen, zeker met je trouwen, de vader van je kindjes zijn ... en waaraan had ik nog gedacht... laten we van elkaar dromen vannacht\n4 woordjes deden mijn benen trillen.4 woordjes deden mijn hoofd draaien.4 woordjes deden mijn hart sneller kloppen.4 woordjes ... ik hou van jou\nWhen the night comes, look at the sky.

Also a psychologist in private practice, Johnson gave the 2020 Harpur Dean\u2019s Distinguished Lecture on 'Predicting Marital Discord and Divorce' on March 10.\nThe lecture represents an opportunity to share Harpur College\u2019s brilliant faculty with the Binghamton community, said Dean Elizabeth Chilton, who is responsible for picking the annual speaker.

Discord can not only shatter marriages, but downgrade physical and mental health, and is associated with all but one of the top 11 mental illnesses, Johnson said. Relationship stress can also crater job performance, impacting not only absenteeism and tardiness, but the size of your paycheck.\nWhat\u2019s more: These effects can linger long after a marriage dissolves. 'Generally speaking, our overall satisfaction with life stays at an even keel,' Johnson explained to a rapt audience of nearly 100 campus and community members in the Innovative Technologies Complex.

He was also part of the directing team on Commonwealth Games chronicle Games 74, and worked both on set and at the editing bench for Paul Maunder's Gone Up North for a While. Pillsbury went solo in 1975. Documentary Birth with R.D. Laing won awards on both sides of the Tasman, and controversy in England and the United States. The film featured controversial Scottish psychiatrist R.D. Laing critiquing Western medical handling of childbirth. Pillsbury also worked on four documentaries for TV slot Seven Days, which variously looked into life for a solo mother, an ex-convict, hospital patients, and young M\u0101ori in the city. More TV docos followed, then in 1978, Against the Lights, a short drama based on a Witi Ihimaera tale. Pillsbury's Round the Bays doco The Greatest Run on Earth won awards at festivals in Chicago and Torino. Pillsbury's feature film debut in 1981 was with The Scarecrow, based on the gothic novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson.

In 1982 The Scarecrow became the first Kiwi film to win invitation to the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, in the non-competitive Director's Fortnight section. Teen star Jono Smith later reinvented himself as a cinematographer in England. Pillsbury then worked extensively on a screen adaptation of end of the world sci- fi novel The Quiet Earth, before handing the project to director Geoff Murphy after deciding it needed fresh eyes( he later joked at being one of the only directors who had fired himself). Instead Pillsbury helmed 1880s immigrant tale Heart of the High Country for TV( based on a novel by Elizabeth Gowans), then segued into period road movie Starlight Hotel, which starred Smash Palace discovery Greer Robson.

Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), to critical and commercial success and subsequently founded the record label GOOD Music. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential hip-hop musicians of all time, as well as one of the greatest musicians of his generation.\n", "Few artists have had as deep an impact on pop culture as Kanye West.

His music has spanned a broad range of styles, incorporating an eclectic range of influences including hip hop, soul, baroque pop, electro, indie rock, synth-pop, industrial, and gospel. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West first became known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for recording artists such as Jay-Z, Ludacris, and Alicia Keys. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album 'The College Dropout' in 2004 to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He went on to experiment with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed studio albums, including 'Late Registration' (2005), 'Graduation' (2007), and the polarizing but influential '808s & Heartbreak' (2008). Released in 2010, West's fifth album ' My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' became his most critically acclaimed album and is widely regarded by critics as the best album of the 2010s. He has since succeeded the album with 'Yeezus' (2013), 'The Life of Pablo' (2016), 'Ye' (2018), and 'Jesus Is King' (2019), as well as full-length collaborations 'Watch the Throne' (2011) and 'Kids See Ghosts' (2018) with Jay-Z and Kid Cudi respectively. West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant media attention. West is a practicing Christian and his religious views have garnered widespread curiosity. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. His marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian has also been a source of substantial media attention. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA. West is among the most critically acclaimed musicians of the 21st century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time with over 100 million records sold worldwide.

Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), to critical and commercial success and subsequently founded the record label GOOD Music. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential hip-hop musicians of all time, as well as one of the greatest musicians of his generation.\n", "Few artists have had as deep an impact on pop culture as Kanye West.

After contributing production to a series of increasingly high-profile projects (including work with Foxy Brown and the Mase-fronted Harlem World), West broke through in 2001 with his work on JAY-Z\u2019s The Blueprint, producing and cowriting some of the album\u2019s biggest songs ('Izzo [H.O.V.A.],' 'Takeover').

The one-time jazz musician and vaudevillian star started his first directing job for the Fox Film Corporation in 1930; he went on to direct a number of films for 20th Century Fox. In 1941, he directed the Fred Astaire film ' You'll Never Get Rich' for Columbia Pictures, then moved to Paramount Pictures. There Lanfield worked on a number of film comedies. He is probably best remembered for directing actor Bob Hope in a number of films including 'My Favorite Blonde' (1942), 'Let's Face It' (1943), 'Where There's Life' (1947), and 'The Lemon Drop Kid' (1951). Lanfield's most profitable film, however, was the first teaming of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and Watson in 1939's 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'. In the early 1950s the reputedly strict taskmaster-director moved to television where his vaudeville and comic background in films were put to use in television comedies including 'Where's Raymond?McHale's Navy' and 'The Addams Family'. Lanfield was married to film actress Shirley Mason from 1927 until his death in 1972. He is interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Lanfield was also known as Sidney Landfield.

Zanuck also instructed director Sidney Lanfield that, 'Every bit player must have a foreign accent.' According to information in the legal records, the film was 'based very slightly' on the screenplay for Fox's 1933 film My Lips Betray, which was also based on Orbok's play.

", "Sidney Lanfield (April 20, 1898 \u2013 June 20, 1972) was an American film director known for directing romances and light comedy films and later television programs. The one-time jazz musician and vaudevillian star started his first directing job for the Fox Film Corporation in 1930; he went on to direct a number of films for 20th Century Fox. In 1941, he directed the Fred Astaire film ' You'll Never Get Rich' for Columbia Pictures, then moved to Paramount Pictures. There Lanfield worked on a number of film comedies. He is probably best remembered for directing actor Bob Hope in a number of films including 'My Favorite Blonde' (1942), 'Let's Face It' (1943), 'Where There's Life' (1947), and 'The Lemon Drop Kid' (1951). Lanfield's most profitable film, however, was the first teaming of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and Watson in 1939's 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'. In the early 1950s the reputedly strict taskmaster-director moved to television where his vaudeville and comic background in films were put to use in television comedies including 'Where's Raymond?McHale's Navy' and 'The Addams Family'. Lanfield was married to film actress Shirley Mason from 1927 until his death in 1972. He is interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Lanfield was also known as Sidney Landfield.

{"ID": 397, "All Sources": ["Silk is a mishmash of science fiction and horror which doesn't work in either field. Some scientists have captured a ghost boy in a room and want to study it. They bring in a super soldier type guy to help them and he proceeds to investigate the history behind the boy's death. The special effects in the movie start out OK, but get progressively worse as the movie nears the end until eventually it gets more and more ridiculous with each death of another character. The capper is when a ghost lady comes out of a bowl of noodle soup. I find it hard to believe the director could think this scene was going to be scary or effective, what was he thinking. The science is only hinted at and is explained away in a cursory fashion, it would have been more interesting to expand on the strange science theme instead of going for typical cheap scares which is what the movie devolves to in the conclusion. The movie has a lot of unnecessary subplots that take away from the atmosphere which can't decide between horror or science fiction or philosophy and ends up being a confused patchwork that doesn't work or jell together. I thought the lead scientist character (he is on a quest to be a ghost) was played too cheesy and it was hard to take him seriously. Although this movie had some creative ideas it had too many drawbacks to rate it higher.\n", "Silk is a Taiwanese film with a mixed cast of Taiwanese and Japanese actors. And often the Taiwanese actors will talk Japanese to make matters even more confusing. It does add an international flair or scale if you will. Chances are however you haven't even heard of this title. It certainly deserves an International audience. Find out why.Silk very successfully combines science fiction, drama and horror. The pacing of Silk is just right. From the start you want to know what is going on. There are certainly enough scares and surprises. However you should keep in mind that this only is the case if you go in blind. Meaning if you know very little or nothing about the film. It could be stated that Silk is a little too ambitious for it's own good where one is trying to deepen the themes and characters. And the attempt is admirable. Ultimately it distracts somewhat and even falls a bit short. One example is the subplot involving Chen Chang (Tung). It's too melodramatic and illogical to make an impact. The horror elements of the story are subtle but scary when it needs to be. There aren't many characters involved and that is a good thing so it's clear you should put the focus on. There are quite a few pivotal matters that are not explained in the story. Like for example the cube they are using in the movie. It's not necessary for the outcome of the main story, but it would have been nice had they actually given us a hint or two of what it's origins are. But what really makes the film worth it is the acting. The cast is great. Chen Chang really carries the film. The actor who plays Hashimoto also is wonderful. You can see in his eyes that he is too obsessed with the case. You aren't quite sure whether too trust him or not. Yet you do feel like rooting for him since you can sense he is at the brink of discovering amazing. It could be that some horror elements are a bit typical compared to other Asian horror films. Honestly, I never had a problem with this since the few scares in the films are very effective. But these scares are secondary to the mystery. The mystery itself is very compelling and you very gladly want to dive into it. Even upon a second viewing the mystery elements remain strong. The horror ones little less so. However there is a little sense of dread and tension felt throughout.Overall this certainly will be worth your time if alone for the wonderful blend of genres.\n", "Silk was marketed as a ghost/ horror movie but actually goes the way of the sci-fi detective film-- you will probably enjoy the development of the story/ premise more than any way it tries to scare you. The science is bogus, of course, and merely a set-up/ device for a science-fictional exploration into the nature of death.

Some scientists have captured a ghost boy in a room and want to study it. They bring in a super soldier type guy to help them and he proceeds to investigate the history behind the boy's death. The special effects in the movie start out OK, but get progressively worse as the movie nears the end until eventually it gets more and more ridiculous with each death of another character. The capper is when a ghost lady comes out of a bowl of noodle soup. I find it hard to believe the director could think this scene was going to be scary or effective, what was he thinking. The science is only hinted at and is explained away in a cursory fashion, it would have been more interesting to expand on the strange science theme instead of going for typical cheap scares which is what the movie devolves to in the conclusion. The movie has a lot of unnecessary subplots that take away from the atmosphere which can't decide between horror or science fiction or philosophy and ends up being a confused patchwork that doesn't work or jell together. I thought the lead scientist character (he is on a quest to be a ghost) was played too cheesy and it was hard to take him seriously. Although this movie had some creative ideas it had too many drawbacks to rate it higher.\n", "Silk is a Taiwanese film with a mixed cast of Taiwanese and Japanese actors. And often the Taiwanese actors will talk Japanese to make matters even more confusing. It does add an international flair or scale if you will. Chances are however you haven't even heard of this title. It certainly deserves an International audience. Find out why.Silk very successfully combines science fiction, drama and horror. The pacing of Silk is just right. From the start you want to know what is going on. There are certainly enough scares and surprises. However you should keep in mind that this only is the case if you go in blind. Meaning if you know very little or nothing about the film. It could be stated that Silk is a little too ambitious for it's own good where one is trying to deepen the themes and characters. And the attempt is admirable. Ultimately it distracts somewhat and even falls a bit short. One example is the subplot involving Chen Chang (Tung). It's too melodramatic and illogical to make an impact. The horror elements of the story are subtle but scary when it needs to be. There aren't many characters involved and that is a good thing so it's clear you should put the focus on. There are quite a few pivotal matters that are not explained in the story. Like for example the cube they are using in the movie. It's not necessary for the outcome of the main story, but it would have been nice had they actually given us a hint or two of what it's origins are. But what really makes the film worth it is the acting. The cast is great. Chen Chang really carries the film. The actor who plays Hashimoto also is wonderful. You can see in his eyes that he is too obsessed with the case. You aren't quite sure whether too trust him or not. Yet you do feel like rooting for him since you can sense he is at the brink of discovering amazing. It could be that some horror elements are a bit typical compared to other Asian horror films. Honestly, I never had a problem with this since the few scares in the films are very effective. But these scares are secondary to the mystery. The mystery itself is very compelling and you very gladly want to dive into it. Even upon a second viewing the mystery elements remain strong. The horror ones little less so. However there is a little sense of dread and tension felt throughout.Overall this certainly will be worth your time if alone for the wonderful blend of genres.\n", "Silk was marketed as a ghost/ horror movie but actually goes the way of the sci-fi detective film-- you will probably enjoy the development of the story/ premise more than any way it tries to scare you. The science is bogus, of course, and merely a set-up/ device for a science-fictional exploration into the nature of death.

And what might the melody be? In folk music, no one thought twice about borrowing an air that was already out there \u2013 and thus it played out.

Kavanagh is said to have sung it to Luke Kelly in the infamous Duke Street pub, The Bailey, in Dublin in the 1960s. Kelly subsequently recorded what is widely considered the definitive version with his group, The Dubliners.

He directed classic films from the silent era and numerous others during Hollywood's Golden Age, when the studio system was prevalent. Curtiz was already a well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros. invited him to Hollywood in 1926, when he was 39 years of age. He had already directed 64 films in Europe, and soon helped Warner Bros. become the fastest-growing movie studio. He directed 102 films during his Hollywood career, mostly at Warners, where he directed ten actors to Oscar nominations. James Cagney and Joan Crawford won their only Academy Awards under Curtiz's direction. He put Doris Day and John Garfield on screen for the first time, and he made stars of Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Bette Davis. He himself was nominated five times and won twice, once for Best Short Subject for 'Sons of Liberty' and once as Best Director for 'Casablanca'. Curtiz introduced to Hollywood a unique visual style using artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high crane shots, and unusual camera angles. He was versatile and could handle any kind of picture: melodrama, comedy, love story, film noir, musical, war story, Western, or historical epic. He always paid attention to the human-interest aspect of every story, stating that the 'human and fundamental problems of real people' were the basis of all good drama. Curtiz helped popularize the classic swashbuckler with films such as 'Captain Blood' (1935) and 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' (1938). He directed many dramas which today are also considered classics, 'Angels with Dirty Faces' (1938), 'The Sea Wolf' (1941), 'Casablanca' (1942), and 'Mildred Pierce' (1945). He directed leading musicals, including 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' (1942), ' This Is the Army' (1943), and 'White Christmas', and he made comedies with 'Life With Father' (1947) and 'We're No Angels' (1955).

She co-starred as part of an ensemble cast including Liam Neeson and Guy Pearce in Martin Campbell's action thriller Memory (2022), in which she played Davana Sealman, an unscrupulous real-estate magnate. She was initially interested in the duality of the antagonist's persona she would play and wanted to avoid typecasting based on her physical appearance, which she had experienced in the past. According to Entertainment Weekly critic Leah Greenblatt Memory is 'wrapped in leaden dialogue and B-movie clich\u00e9' and Bellucci appears 'blas\u00e9'.

Bellucci portrayed Manouche, a tenacious character who has affection for an escaped convicted gangster. Bellucci had the idea of dyeing her hair blonde to adhere to the style of female film noir characters of the 1950s and 1960s. Thierry Jousse, a critic for Lib\u00e9ration, wrote Bellucci was alone in a 'fatally virile' context but she got through it 'to the point of becoming the spectator's compass and the flesh of a film that sometimes lacks it'.

He also produced nearly 80 films between 1933 and 1958. He was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and died in Los Angeles, California. Richard Fleischer later recalled Berke' was known as King of the B's. For years and years he had made nothing but pictures with ten or twelve day shooting schedules, minuscule budgets of about$ 100,000 and no stars. Without bothering with editing or any postproduction chores and with short shooting schedules, he was able to squeeze in eight or ten pictures a year. And he was going nuts'. According to Fleischer, Berke eventually pestered RKO executives enough to be assigned an A picture with a long shooting schedule and stars and he still shot it in twelve days.

His father was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and his mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg. A couple years ago a guest at Buckingham Palace remarked that, like Philip, they were also Greek, to which he responded that he actually didn\u2019t have a drop of Greek blood. That started a question in the papers as to whether that was true and the answer is, well yes, but you\u2019d be forgiven for not knowing that given the styling of his father\u2019s name.\nGeorge I of Greece\nAndrew was legally a Greek prince and he was born in Athens, but he possessed no Greek heritage and his family didn\u2019t consider itself Greek. His father was King George I of Greece, who arrived in Athens for the first time at the age of 17 in 1863. He was its lawful king, but he was selected out of a group of European princes to succeed Otto I after his deposition in 1862. He was in fact a Danish prince, the son of Christian IX and his wife, Louise of Hesse-Kassel.\n", "Last week it was announced that Their Royal Highnesses The\u00a0Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall would travel to Greece later this month and attend its Bicentenary\u00a0Independence Day celebrations.\u00a0 This will be Charles\u2019s third visit to a country where his royal ancestry goes back three generations.\u00a0 The Prince of Wales\u2019s great-grandfather, King George I of Greece, was the second king of modern Greece, reigning from 1863-1913. Born in Denmark in 1845, King George, originally named, Prince William of Denmark, was appointed to the Greek throne by Britain, France and Russia after the first king of Greece, Otto, was removed. King George helped form Greece into a modern European country during his 50 years on the throne. After his Golden Jubilee, King George planned on abdicating the throne for his son Prince Constantine. Sadly, a few weeks before the celebration, King George went on his daily walk in Thessaloniki and was assassinated by an anarchist. Dying instantly, his body would lie in state before being buried at the Greek Royal Family summer palace, Tatoi. King George\u2019s seventh son, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, is the Prince of Wales\u2019s grandfather. Born in 1882, Prince Andrew began military training at a young age, eventually joining the Greek army as an officer and fought in the Balkan Wars. His brother, King Constantine I, took a neutral position in World War I that resulted in the family being exiled to Switzerland. When King Constantine returned to the Greek throne in 1920, Prince Andrew was reinstated in the army. He commanded troops during the Greco-Turkish War, though he refused to follow orders, instead doing his own battle plan that resulted in his troops having to retreat. The loss of the Greco-Turkish War led to the September 11, 1922 revolution and Prince Andrew was arrested for disobeying orders and acting on his own initiative. He and his family were banished for life from Greece and stripped of their nationality. Prince Andrew, his wife, Princess Alice of Battenberg and their five children settled in the outskirts of Paris.\n", "The Greek royal family into which Prince Philip was born is Danish in origin. His paternal grandfather was only 17 when, in 1863, the Greek National Assembly elected him to be their king. He took the title George I; in his family, he was known as William.\nHe had been born Prince Christian William Ferdinand Adolf George of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg, and the year that he became king of Greece, his father succeeded to the throne of Denmark as Christian IX. It was the same year in which George\u2019s sister Alexandra married Queen Victoria\u2019s heir, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales \u2013 the great-grandfather of the British princess George\u2019s grandson would later marry.\nGeorge I, King of Greece, Prince Philip\u2019s grandfather\n", "In the annals of European royalty, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark occupies a distinctive position. Born amidst the grandeur of the Tatoi Palace near Athens, his life was a tapestry of military endeavours, political upheavals, and personal challenges.As the fourth son of George I of Greece, his significance extends beyond his own achievements, notably as the father of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and thereby a linchpin connecting Greek and Danish royalty to the British monarchy. This article delves into the multifaceted life of Prince Andrew Of Greece And Denmark, tracing his journey from the palatial corridors of Athens to his days of exile in the South of France, offering readers a comprehensive insight into a figure whose legacy still resonates in contemporary royal narratives.\nTable of Contents\nMinimize\nEarly Life and Education of Prince Andrew Of Greece And Denmark\nMilitary Career\nMarriage and Family Life\nPolitical Turmoil and Exile\nLegacy and Impact\n", "Prince George of Greece and Denmark (Greek: \u03a0\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03ba\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 \u0393\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; 24 June 1869 \u2013 25 November 1957) was the second son and child of George I of Greece and Olga Konstantinovna of Russia, and is remembered chiefly for having once saved the life of his cousin the future Emperor of Russia, Nicholas II in 1891 during their visit to Japan together. He served as high commissioner of the Cretan State during its transition towards independence from Ottoman rule and union with Greece.

Originally a Danish prince, he was born in Copenhagen, and seemed destined for a career in the Royal Danish Navy. He was only 17 years old when he was elected king by the Greek National Assembly, which had deposed the unpopular former king Otto. His nomination was both suggested and supported by the Great Powers: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Second French Empire and the Russian Empire. He married the Russian grand duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia in 1867, and became the first monarch of a new Greek dynasty. Two of his sisters, Alexandra and Dagmar, married into the British and Russian royal families. King Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III were his brothers-in-law, and King George V, Tsar Nicholas II, King Christian X of Denmark and King Haakon VII of Norway were his nephews. George's reign of almost 50 years (the longest in modern Greek history) was characterized by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-World War I Europe. Britain ceded the Ionian Islands peacefully in 1864, while Thessaly was annexed from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). Greece was not always successful in its territorial ambitions; it was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War (1897). During the First Balkan War, after Greek troops had captured much of Greek Macedonia, George was assassinated in Thessaloniki. Compared with his own long tenure, the reigns of his successors Constantine, Alexander, and George II proved short and insecure.

His father was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and his mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg. A couple years ago a guest at Buckingham Palace remarked that, like Philip, they were also Greek, to which he responded that he actually didn\u2019t have a drop of Greek blood. That started a question in the papers as to whether that was true and the answer is, well yes, but you\u2019d be forgiven for not knowing that given the styling of his father\u2019s name.\nGeorge I of Greece\nAndrew was legally a Greek prince and he was born in Athens, but he possessed no Greek heritage and his family didn\u2019t consider itself Greek. His father was King George I of Greece, who arrived in Athens for the first time at the age of 17 in 1863. He was its lawful king, but he was selected out of a group of European princes to succeed Otto I after his deposition in 1862. He was in fact a Danish prince, the son of Christian IX and his wife, Louise of Hesse-Kassel.\n", "Last week it was announced that Their Royal Highnesses The\u00a0Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall would travel to Greece later this month and attend its Bicentenary\u00a0Independence Day celebrations.\u00a0 This will be Charles\u2019s third visit to a country where his royal ancestry goes back three generations.\u00a0 The Prince of Wales\u2019s great-grandfather, King George I of Greece, was the second king of modern Greece, reigning from 1863-1913. Born in Denmark in 1845, King George, originally named, Prince William of Denmark, was appointed to the Greek throne by Britain, France and Russia after the first king of Greece, Otto, was removed. King George helped form Greece into a modern European country during his 50 years on the throne. After his Golden Jubilee, King George planned on abdicating the throne for his son Prince Constantine. Sadly, a few weeks before the celebration, King George went on his daily walk in Thessaloniki and was assassinated by an anarchist. Dying instantly, his body would lie in state before being buried at the Greek Royal Family summer palace, Tatoi. King George\u2019s seventh son, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, is the Prince of Wales\u2019s grandfather. Born in 1882, Prince Andrew began military training at a young age, eventually joining the Greek army as an officer and fought in the Balkan Wars. His brother, King Constantine I, took a neutral position in World War I that resulted in the family being exiled to Switzerland. When King Constantine returned to the Greek throne in 1920, Prince Andrew was reinstated in the army. He commanded troops during the Greco-Turkish War, though he refused to follow orders, instead doing his own battle plan that resulted in his troops having to retreat. The loss of the Greco-Turkish War led to the September 11, 1922 revolution and Prince Andrew was arrested for disobeying orders and acting on his own initiative. He and his family were banished for life from Greece and stripped of their nationality. Prince Andrew, his wife, Princess Alice of Battenberg and their five children settled in the outskirts of Paris.\n", "The Greek royal family into which Prince Philip was born is Danish in origin. His paternal grandfather was only 17 when, in 1863, the Greek National Assembly elected him to be their king. He took the title George I; in his family, he was known as William.\nHe had been born Prince Christian William Ferdinand Adolf George of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg, and the year that he became king of Greece, his father succeeded to the throne of Denmark as Christian IX. It was the same year in which George\u2019s sister Alexandra married Queen Victoria\u2019s heir, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales \u2013 the great-grandfather of the British princess George\u2019s grandson would later marry.\nGeorge I, King of Greece, Prince Philip\u2019s grandfather\n", "In the annals of European royalty, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark occupies a distinctive position. Born amidst the grandeur of the Tatoi Palace near Athens, his life was a tapestry of military endeavours, political upheavals, and personal challenges.As the fourth son of George I of Greece, his significance extends beyond his own achievements, notably as the father of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and thereby a linchpin connecting Greek and Danish royalty to the British monarchy. This article delves into the multifaceted life of Prince Andrew Of Greece And Denmark, tracing his journey from the palatial corridors of Athens to his days of exile in the South of France, offering readers a comprehensive insight into a figure whose legacy still resonates in contemporary royal narratives.\nTable of Contents\nMinimize\nEarly Life and Education of Prince Andrew Of Greece And Denmark\nMilitary Career\nMarriage and Family Life\nPolitical Turmoil and Exile\nLegacy and Impact\n", "Prince George of Greece and Denmark (Greek: \u03a0\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03ba\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 \u0393\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; 24 June 1869 \u2013 25 November 1957) was the second son and child of George I of Greece and Olga Konstantinovna of Russia, and is remembered chiefly for having once saved the life of his cousin the future Emperor of Russia, Nicholas II in 1891 during their visit to Japan together. He served as high commissioner of the Cretan State during its transition towards independence from Ottoman rule and union with Greece. ", "George I (Greek: \u0393\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u0384, Ge\u00f3rgios I; 24 December 1845 \u2013 18 March 1913) was King of Greece from 1863 until his assassination in 1913. Originally a Danish prince, he was born in Copenhagen, and seemed destined for a career in the Royal Danish Navy. He was only 17 years old when he was elected king by the Greek National Assembly, which had deposed the unpopular former king Otto. His nomination was both suggested and supported by the Great Powers: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Second French Empire and the Russian Empire. He married the Russian grand duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia in 1867, and became the first monarch of a new Greek dynasty. Two of his sisters, Alexandra and Dagmar, married into the British and Russian royal families. King Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III were his brothers-in-law, and King George V, Tsar Nicholas II, King Christian X of Denmark and King Haakon VII of Norway were his nephews. George's reign of almost 50 years (the longest in modern Greek history) was characterized by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-World War I Europe. Britain ceded the Ionian Islands peacefully in 1864, while Thessaly was annexed from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). Greece was not always successful in its territorial ambitions; it was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War (1897). During the First Balkan War, after Greek troops had captured much of Greek Macedonia, George was assassinated in Thessaloniki. Compared with his own long tenure, the reigns of his successors Constantine, Alexander, and George II proved short and insecure.

The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding 'big four' bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first five albums. The band's third album, 'Master of Puppets' (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Its eponymous fifth album, 'Metallica' (1991), the band's first to root predominantly in heavy metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, the band returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, 'Death Magnetic' (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent; after reaching a settlement, Napster became a pay-to-use service in 2003. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film , which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, 'St. Anger' (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band wrote the screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert film , in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline. Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, a cover album, five extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with 'Metallica') have consecutively debuted at number one on the 'Billboard' 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as 'Rolling Stone', which ranked them at no. 61 on its '100 Greatest Artists of All Time' list. As of 2017, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States. ", "'Fuel' is a song by American thrash metal band Metallica. The song was written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett, and was released as the third single from their seventh album, 'Reload'.

On February 7, 2006, Fuel announced through their website singer Brett Scallions had left the band. Fuel had already laid the instrumental tracks for their fourth album and soon began auditioning singers so the band could move forward. Abercrombie and Bell took notice of American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry, after he performed 'Hemorrhage (In My Hands)' on the show. The single achieved the iTunes Top 10 download list, remaining a number of days and sparking interest in other Fuel songs, which began to appear on the iTunes Top 100 download chart. On March 3, 2006, American Idol judge Randy Jackson stated in an interview Daughtry had been offered the opportunity to become Fuel's new lead singer. Fuel confirmed their interest on their official website as well as interviews appearing on CNN Entertainment Tonight. On May 11, 2006, Abercrombie and Bell appeared on the TV show Extra to officially offer Daughtry the job. However, though 'flattered', Daughtry turned down this offer to pursue a solo career. By this time also, Tommy Stewart, formerly of Godsmack, was named on Fuel's Myspace page as Fuel's drummer.\n", "Home \u00bb Entertainment \u00bb Special Events \u00bb Fuel & Saliva\nFriday, Aug 16, 2024 8:00 pm NO REFUNDS/NO EXCHANGES.

The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding 'big four' bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first five albums. The band's third album, 'Master of Puppets' (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Its eponymous fifth album, 'Metallica' (1991), the band's first to root predominantly in heavy metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, the band returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, 'Death Magnetic' (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent; after reaching a settlement, Napster became a pay-to-use service in 2003. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film , which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, 'St. Anger' (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band wrote the screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert film , in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline. Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, a cover album, five extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with 'Metallica') have consecutively debuted at number one on the 'Billboard' 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as 'Rolling Stone', which ranked them at no. 61 on its '100 Greatest Artists of All Time' list. As of 2017, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.

Mr. Silverstone also seemed to trust Josh more than he trusted any of Cher's other boyfriends, as was obvious by his behavior towards Christian and Elton. This trust was obviously because of the brotherly relationship that Josh shared with Cher for years. However, this particular hangup can be explained away easily, as their parents hadn't been married for years, Josh had gone away to college and lived separately, and the two weren't actually related. So, while the two characters were briefly stepsiblings, their age gap is the larger issue and remains questionable at best, and prevents Clueless from truly standing the test of time.\nWhy Cher and Josh's Age Gap Is a Bigger Issue\nClose\nRelated\n10 Teen Movies Everyone Forgot About\n", "Lisa and Kirsten's parents were both widowed. Things can get more complicated when the stepfamily forms as a result of divorce, which is now more common.

And I just want you to know that I'm on your side, and I'm not here to parent you or be some kind of parent figure.'\nShe says creating a more positive relationship between a stepparent and stepchild is vital, because it makes it more likely that stepsiblings will get along too.\nIt's also important for the biological parent to validate their kid's feelings of loss and displacement in a stepfamily, because oftentimes, this is at the root of conflict with their stepsiblings, Sanner says.\nThe Science of Siblings\nNational Siblings Day is a celebration born of love \u2014 and grief\n", "Step Sisters is a 2018 dance comedy film directed by Charles Stone III.

It really didn't,' says Caroline Sanner, an assistant professor of family science at Virginia Tech who studies stepfamily relationships.\nSponsor Message\n'It sets a lot of folks up for disappointment at best,' she says.\n", "Another thing that we noticed in the film is that the black fraternity helps the white sorority learn to step, but the black sorority won\u2019t. Is there a specific message that Step Sisters trying to telling us about race and gender here?\nNo, that idea came from the director, Charles Stone. He thought it would be a more cinematic way to express the lesson about getting intense. And I think that having a frat rather than a sorority allowed them to teach that lesson without the natural competition that tends to occur between organizations of the same gender.\nWith this film and Dear White People under your belt, what can we expect to see from you in the near future?\n", "While they were no longer stepsiblings, the fact that Josh was basically living at Cher's house and enjoyed a mock-stepson relationship with her father proved awkward for many viewers. Mr. Silverstone also seemed to trust Josh more than he trusted any of Cher's other boyfriends, as was obvious by his behavior towards Christian and Elton. This trust was obviously because of the brotherly relationship that Josh shared with Cher for years. However, this particular hangup can be explained away easily, as their parents hadn't been married for years, Josh had gone away to college and lived separately, and the two weren't actually related. So, while the two characters were briefly stepsiblings, their age gap is the larger issue and remains questionable at best, and prevents Clueless from truly standing the test of time.\nWhy Cher and Josh's Age Gap Is a Bigger Issue\nClose\nRelated\n10 Teen Movies Everyone Forgot About\n", "Lisa and Kirsten's parents were both widowed. Things can get more complicated when the stepfamily forms as a result of divorce, which is now more common. Sanner says it's important for the stepparent to reassure their stepchild that they're not trying to replace their other parent, by saying explicitly: 'I know that all of this change might be really hard. And I just want you to know that I'm on your side, and I'm not here to parent you or be some kind of parent figure.'\nShe says creating a more positive relationship between a stepparent and stepchild is vital, because it makes it more likely that stepsiblings will get along too.\nIt's also important for the biological parent to validate their kid's feelings of loss and displacement in a stepfamily, because oftentimes, this is at the root of conflict with their stepsiblings, Sanner says.\nThe Science of Siblings\nNational Siblings Day is a celebration born of love \u2014 and grief\n", "Step Sisters is a 2018 dance comedy film directed by Charles Stone III. It stars Megalyn Echikunwoke as a black sorority girl who agrees to teach the art of Greek stepping to a house of party-obsessed white sorority sisters.

Elvis was also there, and after countering Parker's argument, pleaded: 'Let me give it a shot, man.' Binder claimed that Parker in fact wanted Elvis to 'come out in a tux and sing Christmas songs.' Earl Brown said while Elvis recorded the song, he saw tears rolling down the cheeks of the backing vocalists. One of them whispered to him: 'Elvis never sung with so much emotion.\nLooks like he means every word.' Presley associate Jerry Schilling has said, 'I consider Elvis to be a writer on this song. That song was him expressing how he truly felt.'\nRecording success\n", "According to Steve Binder, who directed Elvis' 68 Comeback Special, the song was also motivated by the assassination of Robert Kennedy which occurred a few weeks prior to its recording. Binder claimed in a 2005 interview that 'One night when we were rehearsing, the television set was on the other room and all of a sudden there was this moment of silence. And I said, 'I think Bobby Kennedy's just been shot'. And we all rushed into the other office and that's exactly what happened. They had live at the Ambassador Hotel, Kennedy making his speech. We were in the piano room at the time, but there was just something weird that evening and I just sensed something had gone wrong. Then we spent the whole night basically talking about the Kennedy assassination, of both Bobby and John.'\nGoldenberg removed his name from the credits to avoid a publishing dispute.

Dancing in the Sky \u2013 Dani and Lizzy This beautiful song is about losing someone who was in a lot of pain. This could be emotional pain or physical pain. The song details a series of questions about what heaven is like, if their pain is gone, if there\u2019s music, or if they\u2019re more alive. But despite the singers knowing that the person is now in a better place, life on earth without them feels a bit emptier.\n", "Following the song's use in the 2001 film Ocean's Eleven, 'A Little Less Conversation' was remixed by Dutch musician Tom Holkenborg, better known as Junkie XL (billed as JXL).

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the 'King of Rock and Roll' or simply 'the King'. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. ", "'Edge of Reality' is a song first recorded by Elvis Presley as part of the soundtrack for his 1968 motion picture ' Live a Little, Love a Little', released to cinemas on October 23. In October or November 1968 it was released on a single (RCA Victor 47-9670) with 'If I Can Dream' (from his soon to be released album 'Elvis', the soundtrack for the upcoming NBC TV comeback special) on the other side. The single was the first Presley record on the orange label. On December 1, 1970 the single 'If I Can DreamEdge of Reality' was re-released as part of RCA Victor's Gold Standard Series (together with 9 other Presley's singles).

Elvis was also there, and after countering Parker's argument, pleaded: 'Let me give it a shot, man.' Binder claimed that Parker in fact wanted Elvis to 'come out in a tux and sing Christmas songs.' Earl Brown said while Elvis recorded the song, he saw tears rolling down the cheeks of the backing vocalists. One of them whispered to him: 'Elvis never sung with so much emotion.\nLooks like he means every word.' Presley associate Jerry Schilling has said, 'I consider Elvis to be a writer on this song. That song was him expressing how he truly felt.'\nRecording success\n", "According to Steve Binder, who directed Elvis' 68 Comeback Special, the song was also motivated by the assassination of Robert Kennedy which occurred a few weeks prior to its recording. Binder claimed in a 2005 interview that 'One night when we were rehearsing, the television set was on the other room and all of a sudden there was this moment of silence. And I said, 'I think Bobby Kennedy's just been shot'. And we all rushed into the other office and that's exactly what happened. They had live at the Ambassador Hotel, Kennedy making his speech. We were in the piano room at the time, but there was just something weird that evening and I just sensed something had gone wrong. Then we spent the whole night basically talking about the Kennedy assassination, of both Bobby and John.'\nGoldenberg removed his name from the credits to avoid a publishing dispute. The song was published by Presley's company Gladys Music, Inc.\n", "17. I\u2019ll Be Missing You \u2013 Sean Combs, Faith Evans This song about death is all about how you\u2019ll miss someone after they\u2019ve died. The lyrics, 'Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show,' talk about how not too long ago, you and the deceased used to live life together and make the most of the moment. The chorus reminds you that it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re doing; you\u2019ll always miss the person who has died. This death song is about losing someone extraordinary in your life.\n18. Dancing in the Sky \u2013 Dani and Lizzy This beautiful song is about losing someone who was in a lot of pain. This could be emotional pain or physical pain. The song details a series of questions about what heaven is like, if their pain is gone, if there\u2019s music, or if they\u2019re more alive. But despite the singers knowing that the person is now in a better place, life on earth without them feels a bit emptier.\n", "Following the song's use in the 2001 film Ocean's Eleven, 'A Little Less Conversation' was remixed by Dutch musician Tom Holkenborg, better known as Junkie XL (billed as JXL).
