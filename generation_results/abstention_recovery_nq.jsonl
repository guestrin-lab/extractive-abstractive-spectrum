The CHP has primary patrol jurisdiction over all California highways and roads and streets outside city limits, and can exercise law enforcement powers anywhere within the state. The California Highway Patrol can assist local and county agencies and can patrol major city streets along with local and county law enforcement, state and interstate highways, and is the primary law enforcement agency in rural parts of the state. The California State Legislature originally established the California Highway Patrol as a branch of the Division of Motor Vehicles in the Department of Public Works, with legislation signed by Governor C. C. Young on August 14, 1929. It was subsequently established as a separate department with legislation signed by Governor Earl Warren in 1947. The CHP gradually assumed increased responsibility beyond the enforcement of the State Vehicle Act and eventually merged with the smaller California State Police in 1995. It is currently organized as part of the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA). In addition to its highway patrol duties, the CHP also provides other services including protecting state buildings and facilities (most notably the California State Capitol) and guarding state officials. The CHP also works with municipal and federal law enforcement agencies, providing assistance in investigations, patrol and other aspects of law enforcement. The agency is responsible for law enforcement on all California state routes (including all freeways and expressways), U.S. Highways, Interstate Highways and all public roads in unincorporated and incorporated portions of any specific county. Local police or the local sheriff's department having a contract with an incorporated city are primarily responsible for investigating and enforcing traffic laws in incorporated cities, but any peace officer of the CHP can still enforce any state law anywhere within the state, even though the agency's primary mission is related to transportation. Furthermore, CHP officers act as bailiffs for the California Supreme Court and the six California Courts of Appeal, and also provide security at buildings occupied by the State of California. The Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle replaced the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor in 2013. ", "The California Highway Patrol's additional responsibilities includes a governor protection detail. Somewhat controversially, the cities of Oakland and Stockton have contracted with the California Highway Patrol to assist their police departments with local patrol duties, including traffic stops and responding to 911 calls. Pay and pensions Average officer pay was $118,000 in 2014. By law, salaries are set by an average of the five largest police departments in the state. In 2012, the top paid CHP officer received $483,581, 44 other officers earning over $200,000, and over 5,000 officers receiving over $100,000. In 2011, CHP officers earned $82.4 million in overtime, triple the amount in the second largest state, and with one officer earning over $93,000 in overtime alone. Officers are strictly prohibited from working more than 16.5 hours at a time before having to take a minimum 8-hour break. ", "CHP uniforms are traditionally khaki-colored with campaign hat and blue-and-gold trouser stripe. Command officers wear a tan combination cap. The dress uniform includes a forest green jacket and royal blue tie (bow tie for motor officers). Cold weather and utility uniforms are dark blue.California Highway Patrol campaign hat Leather gear is black basketweave leather with brass snaps and buckles. Standard traffic enforcement patrol vehicles are required by state law to have a white door with, in the case of the CHP, a star. The CHP operates traditional black and white as well as all-white patrol vehicles. The California Highway Patrol is one of the few organizations to continue to use the older toll-free 'Zenith 1-2000' number. With the falling cost of telephone area code 800 and 888 numbers, most organizations have chosen to switch to one of the newer numbers and discontinue use of the Zenith service, which requires operator assistance. The CHP's traditions include its own radio codes, widely adopted by local agencies. The most important is 11\u201199, which signifies that an officer needs emergency assistance or that an officer is down. ", "The 'Mexico Liaison Unit' is a Border Division Unit based in San Diego. Since the CHP has no jurisdiction directly in Mexico, officers from the Unit work closely with Mexican authorities to recover stolen vehicles and assist with other law enforcement issues. The purpose of the 'Mexico Liaison Unit' is to develop and maintain positive working relations with Mexican authorities in order to: Locate and identify stolen U.S. vehicles taken to Mexico Identify vehicle thieves and ensure their prosecution, either in Mexico or California Provide assistance to Mexican and U.S. authorities The unit was originally established in 1958 and only consisted of one officer. It was discontinued in the 1970s, and reestablished in 1980. The unit now consists of one sergeant and six officers, all of whom are fluent in Spanish. Newhall Incident Further information: Newhall incident ", "A follow-up investigation eventually led to a complete revision of procedures during high-risk and felony stops. Firearms procedures have also changed fundamentally due to this incident, and physical methods of arrest have been improved. The police baton and pepper spray have been added to the officer's arsenal, with more in\u2011depth training in their use. The 25th anniversary of the Newhall Incident was observed on April 6, 1995, at the present Newhall Area office, where a brick memorial pays tribute to Officers George Alleyn (6290), Walt Frago (6520), Roger Gore (6547) and James Pence (6885). The memorial once stood at the former Newhall office, but was rebuilt at the new site, about one mile (1.6 km) from the scene of the slayings. History of the former California State Police and its Merger with the California Highway Patrol On July 12, 1995, the California State Police, which was a separate agency, was merged into the CHP, thus greatly expanding the agency's mandate. In addition to safety on the state highway system, it is now responsible for the safety of all elected state officials and all people who work in or are utilizing a state building in California, such as the State Capitol Building in Sacramento. It has also been discussed to merge the Law Enforcement Division of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife into the California Highway Patrol. By doing so, this may allow for better protection of California's environment and natural resources. The underfunded CDFW Law Enforcement Division has faced low numbers of Game Wardens also known as Wildlife Officers for the last ten years; a similar idea is already in place in Oregon and Alaska, where the Oregon State Police and Alaska State Troopers serve as game wardens under a separate fish and wildlife division within the two departments.

It is about a boy who buys and trains two Redbone Coonhounds for hunting. The book is a work of autobiographical fiction based on Rawls' own childhood in the Ozarks. My friend Eileen, the dog trainer, currently lives in Minnesota but we met when she lived in Florida. I suspect it\u2019s cold in Minnesota during the winter like the Ozarks. I called New Year's Day to brag about a new kayak my boyfriend and I had gotten at Christmas because I had met Eileen while volunteering at a sailing non-profit for the disabled and we both loved the water, but I did not get an answer. 'Where the Red Fern Grows' is a coming-of-age story which deals with the classic theme of maturity as Billy learns to work hard, be a leader, and be self-reliant. Because the setting is in the Ozarks, man's relationship to nature is part of the ongoing narrative. A lesson often repeated in the book is that hard work pays off. This can be illustrated by how Billy saved up and purchased the two Redbone Coonhounds dogs, and then trained them. Throughout the story, we see how love, and not just loyalty, enables the trio to persist and overcome. I was not surprised that Eileen trained dogs after working with her at Sailability, the non-profit. She was such a dedicated and patient soul. I was even more impressed when she took in a puppy to train to be a service dog. ", "Where the Red Fern Grows is a children\u2019s book by Wilson Rawls and it is the story of a young boy, longing for two red hounds while living in the Ozarks with his family in the woods. Billy works hard for two years and secretively saves enough money, $50, to buy two hound puppies that he reads about in a magazine left behind by outdoorsmen in the woods and the river bottoms he frequents. With the help of his grandfather, Billy gets his pups, then he raises them and teaches them to hunt 'coons', and becomes somewhat famous in his little neck of the woods of Oklahoma. Billy names his pups Old Dan and Little Nan in a touching moment of the story that I will leave you to find out someday if you read the book. The story is about the love of a boy for his dogs and the love of a family. It is about overcoming obstacles to achieve goals and it is about faith and endurance and character as well. ", "The story, a novel, is based on Wilson Rawls\u2019 childhood. Rawls grew up, much as Billy does, on a small farm in the Ozarks. His mother taught him to read until he and his sister could finally attend school. It took him years and years to write Where the Red Fern Grows, which started first as a serial,'Hounds of Youth' in the 'Saturday Evening Post' and was first published as an adult novel. Only when schoolchildren started to read it and launched a campaign for it to become a children\u2019s book did it reach the level of fame it has maintained since 1961. We get two good stories out of Where the Red Fern Grows; the story of Billy, Old Dan and Little Nan, and the story of Wilson Rawls.

Monday, I finished 'Where the Red Fern Grows' by Wilson Rawls.  Though I needed a box of tissues to get through the end of the book, I loved every exhilarating, loving and heartbreaking word.  I sat there with my dog Rocky laying in my lap and read the last pages about Billy\u2019s childhood and the little hunting dogs who changed his life. 'Where the Red Fern Grows' is a story about a determined boy with a terrible case of 'dog-wanting disease' set in the Ozarks of northeastern Oklahoma during the Great Depression.  After saying a prayer asking for help with getting his hunting pups, Billy Coleman spent two long years working to earn and save $50.00 to buy two little hunting puppies he had seen listed in a fisherman\u2019s discarded magazine.  With the help of his Grandfather, his prayer is answered. 'I wanted so much to step over and pick them up.  Several times I tried to move my feet, but they seemed to be nailed to the floor.  I knew the pups were mine, all mine, yet I couldn\u2019t move.  My heart started acting like a drunk grasshopper.  I tried to swallow and couldn\u2019t.  My Adam\u2019s apple wouldn\u2019t work. One pup started my way.  I held my breath.  On he came until I felt a scratchy little foot on mine.  The other pup followed.  A warm puppy tongue caressed my sore foot. I heard the stationmaster say, 'They already know you.' ", "'Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.' -Ecclesiastes 4:9 One of my favorite books is Where the Red Fern Grows. I first read this book when I was in the 5th grade. It is a wonderful book about a young boy, Billy Coleman, who dreams of having his own hunting dogs. Billy works and saves to buy two Redbone Coonhounds. When the two young pups arrive, Billy names them Dan and Ann. Billy and the dogs are inseparable. They spend their free time hunting. The theme of the well-loved book is relationship and adventure. The book records the many adventures in the Ozark mountains, while allowing the reader to see how powerful the love between a boy and dogs can truly be.

{"ID": 268, "All Sources": ["It was the first and only time until Super Bowl XLVIII in Super Bowl history that the league's number one-ranked offense (Raiders) was pitted against the league's number one-ranked defense (Buccaneers). Super Bowl XXXVII is also referred to as the 'Pirate Bowl', due to both teams' pirate-themed names. The game is sometimes referred to as the 'Gruden Bowl', because the primary storyline surrounding the game revolved around Jon Gruden. Gruden was the Raiders' head coach from 1998 to 2001, and then became the Buccaneers coach in 2002. Tampa Bay, 'Gruden's new team', made their first Super Bowl appearance in team history after posting a 12\u20134 regular season record. Oakland, 'Gruden's old team', advanced to their fifth Super Bowl after an 11\u20135 regular season. This was also the first Super Bowl to feature two former division rivals, as the Buccaneers and Raiders both played in the AFC West in 1976. The Raiders came into the game as four-point favorites. However, the Tampa Bay defense dominated the contest. Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon threw a Super Bowl record five interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. The Buccaneers also sacked Gannon five times, and scored 34 consecutive points to build a 34\u20133 lead late in the third quarter. Tampa Bay safety Dexter Jackson, who had two of those interceptions and returned them for 34 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Jackson became only the second safety and third defensive back named Super Bowl MVP. Background ", "Raiders owner Al Davis was known to have the lowest salaries for coaches in the league, and Gruden was no exception. Instead of paying a high salary for Gruden, Davis opted to trade the rights for Gruden to the Buccaneers in exchange for four draft picks, in a deal similar to what Patriots owner Robert Kraft made with the New York Jets to get head coach Bill Belichick in 2000. The Buccaneers ended up giving two first-round picks, two second-round picks and $8 million to the Raiders to get Gruden. Tampa Bay was desperate to have someone rebuild their offense so it would complement their powerful defense in an attempt to win the Super Bowl. ", "The season began with the team trying to improve on a 9\u20137 season and did so with a franchise-best 12\u20134 record. It was Jon Gruden's first season as the Buccaneers\u2019 head coach. They won the Super Bowl for the first time in the team's history, beating the Oakland Raiders 48\u201321. This was Tampa Bay's only Super Bowl appearance and win until 2020, with the Super Bowl win also being their most recent playoff game win in the same span. The 2002 Buccaneers\u2019 defense, which included four players who would eventually be elected the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is often cited as one of the best ever, as well as one of the most potent pass defenses in league history. In 2019, the NFL ranked the 2002 Buccaneers as the 45th best NFL team of all time. Summary 'Pound the rock!' was the slogan of the 2002 team ", "The offense made slight improvements during the season, but the strength of the team was the defense. The 2002 Buccaneers became the first team to lead the league in total defense, points allowed, and interceptions since the 1985 Chicago Bears. They also held opposing quarterbacks to an unbelievable 48.4 passer rating for the season. Led by this dominating defense, the 2002 Buccaneers achieved their most successful season to date. They won the NFC South title with the team's best ever record, 12\u20134, and then defeated the 49ers in what became coach Steve Mariucci\u2019s last game with that franchise. In a surprising upset, Tampa Bay won their first NFC Championship on the road against the Eagles in the last NFL game ever played at Veterans Stadium. Cornerback Ronde Barber capped off the win by intercepting a Donovan McNabb pass and returning it 92 yards for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter. ", "As many sports fans and writers predicted, Gruden's prior knowledge of the Raiders was a major factor in the Buccaneers\u2019 win in Super Bowl XXXVII. The most damaging piece of evidence is NFL Films footage of Tampa Bay safety John Lynch telling his teammates during the game that almost all of the plays ran by Oakland's offense were plays that Gruden (who that week even played the part of 'Rich Gannon' by playing quarterback with the scout-team offense) specifically told them to look out for. Better still for the Buccaneers was the fact that Oakland hadn't changed their audible-calling signals that Gruden himself had installed, thus tipping off plays repeatedly. As a result, Tampa Bay dominated Oakland, outgaining them in total yards (365 to 269), rushing yards (150 to 19), first downs (24 to 11), offensive plays (76 to 60), and forced turnovers (5 to 1). The Raiders had a great chance to score a touchdown early in the game after cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Buccaneers quarterback Brad Johnson's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 12 yards to the Tampa Bay 36-yard line. But 6 plays later, Tampa Bay defensive end Simeon Rice sacked Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon on third down, forcing Oakland to settle for kicker Sebastian Janikowski's 40-yard field goal to give them a 3\u20130 lead. Buccaneers kick returner Aaron Stecker returned the ensuing kickoff 27 yards to the 29-yard line, then appeared to fumble the ball. Although the officials initially ruled that the ball was recovered by Oakland's Eric Johnson, the play was reviewed by instant replay and the fumble was overturned, and thus Tampa Bay retained possession. On the first play of the drive, Brad Johnson completed an 11-yard pass to receiver Joe Jurevicius. Johnson's next 2 passes were incomplete, but he then completed a 23-yard pass to Jurevicius on third down to advance the ball to the Oakland 37-yard line. Running back Michael Pittman then rushed for a 23-yard gain to the 13-yard line. However, on the next three plays, the Raiders defense limited the Buccaneers to a pair of incompletions and a 1-yard run. Kicker Martin Gramatica then made a 31-yard field goal to tie the game, 3\u20133. ", "Tampa Bay responded by moving the ball to the Oakland 9-yard line on their ensuing drive, featuring a 24-yard run by Pittman, but they came up empty after Tupa fumbled the snap on a field goal attempt. A few plays later, Gannon threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Rice with 6:06 left in the game, cutting the Raiders' deficit to 34\u201321. Rice became the first player to catch a touchdown pass in four different Super Bowls, and third overall to have touchdowns in four Super Bowls (Thurman Thomas and John Elway). The two-point conversion failed when Jerry Porter caught the ball and was forced out of bounds; while the official did not judge it to be a force-out, (judgement call) hence, that part of the play was non reviewable. ", "Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady tossed three touchdowns in the first half of Super Bowl 55. It was Brady's seventh Super Bowl victory and his first with the Bucs. Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images It was a record 10th Super Bowl appearance for Brady. He played in nine for the New England Patriots (winning six, a record) in his 20 seasons with New England. This was Brady's first year with the Bucs and he led his new team to only their second Super Bowl in franchise history. Brady also was named as the Super Bowl MVP \u2014 for the fifth time, extending his record.

The Buccaneers also sacked Gannon five times, and scored 34 consecutive points to build a 34\u20133 lead late in the third quarter. Tampa Bay safety Dexter Jackson, who had two of those interceptions and returned them for 34 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Jackson became only the second safety and third defensive back named Super Bowl MVP. Background ", "http://www.buccaneersfan.com/Pages/TeamZone/History/history-superbowl-xxxvii.htm\nRaiders owner Al Davis was known to have the lowest salaries for coaches in the league, and Gruden was no exception. Instead of paying a high salary for Gruden, Davis opted to trade the rights for Gruden to the Buccaneers in exchange for four draft picks, in a deal similar to what Patriots owner Robert Kraft made with the New York Jets to get head coach Bill Belichick in 2000. The Buccaneers ended up giving two first-round picks, two second-round picks and $8 million to the Raiders to get Gruden. Tampa Bay was desperate to have someone rebuild their offense so it would complement their powerful defense in an attempt to win the Super Bowl. ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season\nThe season began with the team trying to improve on a 9\u20137 season and did so with a franchise-best 12\u20134 record. It was Jon Gruden's first season as the Buccaneers\u2019 head coach. They won the Super Bowl for the first time in the team's history, beating the Oakland Raiders 48\u201321. This was Tampa Bay's only Super Bowl appearance and win until 2020, with the Super Bowl win also being their most recent playoff game win in the same span. The 2002 Buccaneers\u2019 defense, which included four players who would eventually be elected the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is often cited as one of the best ever, as well as one of the most potent pass defenses in league history. In 2019, the NFL ranked the 2002 Buccaneers as the 45th best NFL team of all time. Summary 'Pound the rock!' was the slogan of the 2002 team ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season\nThe offense made slight improvements during the season, but the strength of the team was the defense. The 2002 Buccaneers became the first team to lead the league in total defense, points allowed, and interceptions since the 1985 Chicago Bears. They also held opposing quarterbacks to an unbelievable 48.4 passer rating for the season. Led by this dominating defense, the 2002 Buccaneers achieved their most successful season to date. They won the NFC South title with the team's best ever record, 12\u20134, and then defeated the 49ers in what became coach Steve Mariucci\u2019s last game with that franchise. In a surprising upset, Tampa Bay won their first NFC Championship on the road against the Eagles in the last NFL game ever played at Veterans Stadium. Cornerback Ronde Barber capped off the win by intercepting a Donovan McNabb pass and returning it 92 yards for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter.

Better still for the Buccaneers was the fact that Oakland hadn't changed their audible-calling signals that Gruden himself had installed, thus tipping off plays repeatedly. As a result, Tampa Bay dominated Oakland, outgaining them in total yards (365 to 269), rushing yards (150 to 19), first downs (24 to 11), offensive plays (76 to 60), and forced turnovers (5 to 1). The Raiders had a great chance to score a touchdown early in the game after cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Buccaneers quarterback \u001b[102m[1] Brad Johnson\u001b[0m's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 12 yards to the Tampa Bay 36-yard line. But 6 plays later, Tampa Bay defensive end Simeon Rice sacked Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon on third down, forcing Oakland to settle for kicker Sebastian Janikowski's 40-yard field goal to give them a 3\u20130 lead. Buccaneers kick returner Aaron Stecker returned the ensuing kickoff 27 yards to the 29-yard line, then appeared to fumble the ball.

Others were determined to remain neutral, even as that became harder in the midst of a civil war.

More than 20 percent of the enslaved population voted with their feet and ran to British lines in South Carolina and Georgia during the war to claim their freedom. At the end of the war, these black Loyalists pressed the British to honor their promise of freedom, which they grudgingly did, providing transportation for them and many white Loyalists to the British colony of Nova Scotia in today\u2019s Canada.

Most Patriots had religious commitments that prevented them from joining a side, even though it made them unpopular. Support for the war increased over time, and by the end of the conflict, every colonist identified as a Patriot. 2. What best describes the Loyalists before and during the American Revolution? Loyalists were willing to risk treason and death to support colonial independence and remained devoted to the ideas of enlightenment. Loyalists continued to support the British Parliament or king, believing their economic or political interests would be best served by fighting for, or at least speaking up for, the British. Most Loyalists identified as pacifists and were morally unable to choose a side, owing to their religious beliefs. Loyalists tended to be upper middle class, educated elites; their social identity was woven to that of the crown. ", "The American Revolutionary War (April 19, 1775 \u2013 September 3, 1783), also known as the Revolutionary War or American War of Independence, was an armed conflict that was part of the broader American Revolution, in which American Patriot forces organized as the Continental Army and commanded by George Washington defeated the British Army. During the war, North American Patriot forces had the support of France, Spain and the Dutch Republic, while the British and Loyalist forces hired Hessian soldiers from Germany for assistance. The conflict was fought in North America, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean. The war ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which resulted in Great Britain ultimately recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the United States. ", "After the Patriot victory at Concord, moderates in Congress led by John Dickinson drafted the Olive Branch Petition, offering to accept royal authority in return for George III mediating in the dispute. However, since the petition was immediately followed by the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, Colonial Secretary Lord Dartmouth viewed the offer as insincere; he refused to present the petition to the king, which was therefore rejected in early September. Although constitutionally correct, since George could not oppose his own government, it disappointed those Americans who hoped he would mediate in the dispute, while the hostility of his language annoyed even Loyalist members of Congress. Combined with the Proclamation of Rebellion, issued on August 23 in response to the Battle at Bunker Hill, it ended hopes of a peaceful settlement. Backed by the Whigs, Parliament initially rejected the imposition of coercive measures by 170 votes, fearing an aggressive policy would simply drive the Americans towards independence. However, by the end of 1774 the collapse of British authority meant both Lord North and George III were convinced war was inevitable. After Boston, Gage halted operations and awaited reinforcements; the Irish Parliament approved the recruitment of new regiments, while allowing Catholics to enlist for the first time. Britain also signed a series of treaties with German states to supply additional troops. Within a year, it had an army of over 32,000 men in America, the largest ever sent outside Europe at the time. The employment of German soldiers against people viewed as British citizens was opposed by many in Parliament and by the colonial assemblies; combined with the lack of activity by Gage, opposition to the use of foreign troops allowed the Patriots to take control of the legislatures. ", "and instead resulted in the closing of the port of Boston and the declaration of martial law in Massachusetts, the colonial governments sent delegates to a Continental Congress to coordinate a colonial boycott of British goods. When fighting broke out between American colonists and British forces in Massachusetts, the Continental Congress worked with local groups, originally intended to enforce the boycott, to coordinate resistance against the British. British officials throughout the colonies increasingly found their authority challenged by informal local governments, although loyalist sentiment remained strong in some areas. Despite these changes, colonial leaders hoped to reconcile with the British Government, and all but the most radical members of Congress were unwilling to declare independence. However, in late 1775, Benjamin Franklin, then a member of the Secret Committee of Correspondence, hinted to French agents and other ", "Another grievance in the Declaration of Independence was that the King and his government had 'endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages.' Many rebel colonists assumed that Native Americans would naturally be allied with the British. But most Native communities tried to avoid getting involved in what they saw as a family dispute between the King and his subjects. But both the British and the Americans sought out Native allies throughout the conflict. Officers in both armies, including General George Washington, had fought in the French and Indian War. They had learned to appreciate the value of Native warriors, who had acted as scouts for European armies and launched devastating raids on the colonial frontiers. ", "Perhaps the single most important reason for the patriot victory was the breadth of popular support for the Revolution. The Revolution would have failed miserably without the participation of thousands of ordinary farmers, artisans, and laborers who put themselves into the line of fire. The Revolution's support cut across region, religion, and social rank. Common farmers, artisans, shopkeepers, petty merchants were major actors during the Revolution. Ex-servants, uneducated farmers, immigrants, and slaves emerged into prominence in the Continental Army. ", "Washington\u2019s support of using non-importation as leverage against the British can be traced back as far as 1769 in letters between him and George Mason. When the colonies first started publicly supporting non-importation, Bryan Fairfax, a longtime friend of Washington\u2019s, wrote to him urging him to not support the Continental Association and to instead petition Parliament. Washington dismissed this suggestion, writing 'we have already Petitiond his Majesty in as humble, & dutiful a manner as Subjects could do.'1 Washington, like many delegates at the First Continental Congress, no longer saw petitioning as a useful tool in changing Parliament\u2019s ways.

", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War\nThe American Revolutionary War (April 19, 1775 \u2013 September 3, 1783), also known as the Revolutionary War or American War of Independence, was an armed conflict that was part of the broader American Revolution, in which American Patriot forces organized as the Continental Army and commanded by George Washington defeated the British Army. During the war, North American Patriot forces had the support of France, Spain and the Dutch Republic, while the British and Loyalist forces hired Hessian soldiers from Germany for assistance. The conflict was fought in North America, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean. The war ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which resulted in Great Britain ultimately recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the United States. ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War\nAfter the Patriot victory at Concord, moderates in Congress led by John Dickinson drafted the Olive Branch Petition, offering to accept royal authority in return for George III mediating in the dispute. However, since the petition was immediately followed by the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, Colonial Secretary Lord Dartmouth viewed the offer as insincere; he refused to present the petition to the king, which was therefore rejected in early September. Although constitutionally correct, since George could not oppose his own government, it disappointed those Americans who hoped he would mediate in the dispute, while the hostility of his language annoyed even Loyalist members of Congress. Combined with the Proclamation of Rebellion, issued on August 23 in response to the Battle at Bunker Hill, it ended hopes of a peaceful settlement. Backed by the Whigs, Parliament initially rejected the imposition of coercive measures by 170 votes, fearing an aggressive policy would simply drive the Americans towards independence. However, by the end of 1774 the collapse of British authority meant both Lord North and George III were convinced war was inevitable. After Boston, Gage halted operations and awaited reinforcements; the Irish Parliament approved the recruitment of new regiments, while allowing Catholics to enlist for the first time. Britain also signed a series of treaties with German states to supply additional troops. Within a year, it had an army of over 32,000 men in America, the largest ever sent outside Europe at the time. The employment of German soldiers against people viewed as British citizens was opposed by many in Parliament and by the colonial assemblies; combined with the lack of activity by Gage, opposition to the use of foreign troops allowed the Patriots to take control of the legislatures. ", "https://history.state.gov/milestones/1776-1783/declaration\nand instead resulted in the closing of the port of Boston and the declaration of martial law in Massachusetts, the colonial governments sent delegates to a Continental Congress to coordinate a colonial boycott of British goods. When fighting broke out between American colonists and British forces in Massachusetts, the Continental Congress worked with local groups, originally intended to enforce the boycott, to coordinate resistance against the British. British officials throughout the colonies increasingly found their authority challenged by informal local governments, although loyalist sentiment remained strong in some areas. Despite these changes, colonial leaders hoped to reconcile with the British Government, and all but the most radical members of Congress were unwilling to declare independence. However, in late 1775, Benjamin Franklin, then a member of the Secret Committee of Correspondence, hinted to French agents and other ", "https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/roles-native-americans-during-revolution\nAnother grievance in the Declaration of Independence was that the King and his government had 'endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages.' Many rebel colonists assumed that Native Americans would naturally be allied with the British. But most Native communities tried to avoid getting involved in what they saw as a family dispute between the King and his subjects. But both the British and the Americans sought out Native allies throughout the conflict. Officers in both armies, including General George Washington, had fought in the French and Indian War. They had learned to appreciate the value of Native warriors, who had acted as scouts for European armies and launched devastating raids on the colonial frontiers. ", "https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&psid=3220\nPerhaps the single most important reason for the patriot victory was the breadth of popular support for the Revolution. The Revolution would have failed miserably without the participation of thousands of ordinary farmers, artisans, and laborers who put themselves into the line of fire. The Revolution's support cut across region, religion, and social rank. Common farmers, artisans, shopkeepers, petty merchants were major actors during the Revolution. Ex-servants, uneducated farmers, immigrants, and slaves emerged into prominence in the Continental Army. ", "https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/first-continental-congress\nWashington\u2019s support of using non-importation as leverage against the British can be traced back as far as 1769 in letters between him and George Mason. When the colonies first started publicly supporting non-importation, Bryan Fairfax, a longtime friend of Washington\u2019s, wrote to him urging him to not support the Continental Association and to instead petition Parliament. Washington dismissed this suggestion, writing 'we have already Petitiond his Majesty in as humble, & dutiful a manner as Subjects could do.'1 Washington, like many delegates at the First Continental Congress, no longer saw petitioning as a useful tool in changing Parliament\u2019s ways.

Squanto was to become the primary force behind the Pilgrims\u2019 unlikely survival in the New World. On March 22, 1621, the vernal equinox, Squanto walked out of the forest into the middle of the Pilgrims\u2019 ramshackle base at Plymouth, a settlement known to Squanto as Patuxet. That place was once his home. To the Pilgrims\u2019 amazement, Squanto spoke nearly perfect English, and arrived prepared to remain with them and guide them through everything from fishing to agriculture to negotiations with the nervous and well-armed Massasoit and the Wampanoag.As historian Charles C. Mann wrote in 'Native Intelligence,' (Smithsonian, December 2005), 'Tisquantum was critical to the colony\u2019s survival.' Squanto taught them to plant the native corn they had stolen instead of just eating it, and he negotiated a fair trade for the theft of the corn. ", "The Mayflower set sail from the English port of Plymouth on September 6, 1620. A leaky old wine ship, it carried 102 passengers, plus around thirty crewmen and various livestock. The passengers were mostly English members of a dissenting Separatist congregation that had lived in exile in the Dutch city of Leiden, together with their servants. Also traveling on the Mayflower were people the other passengers called 'strangers.' These were a mixed group of emigrants recruited by the Merchant Adventurers, a trading company based in London that had invested in the journey as a commercial opportunity. ", "Mayflower embarked about sixty-five passengers in London about the middle of July 1620, proceeded to Southampton on the English south coast and met Speedwell bringing the Leyden contingent from Holland. The two ships planned to begin their trans-Atlantic journey on 5 August, but problems with Speedwell, which could not be corrected, caused the loss of a month of critical voyage time with the fall Atlantic gale season coming on. After two false starts and repairs to Speedwell, some of the passengers chose not to continue and returned to Holland on Speedwell. The remaining passengers boarded the Mayflower, which with 102 passengers and a crew of possibly 30-40, finally departed Plymouth, Devon on 6 September O.S. (16 September, N.S.). After 66 days of fighting gales and with the ship's timbers rupturing, and with a detriment to the health of all on board, the Mayflower finally arrived within the waters of the Cape Cod Bay on 11 November before anchoring off what is now Provincetown. Recent research has revealed that the ship docked at the tiny fishing village of Renews in Newfoundland for fresh water and food before arriving in Provincetown. The Mayflower and its passengers and crew would proceed to establish a settlement at Plymouth, on the other side of the Cape Cod Bay from Provincetown. ", "The Mayflower made excellent time on her return voyage back to England. The westerly winds that had buffeted the ship on departure pushed her along going home, and she arrived at her home port in Rotherhithe on the Thames on 5 May 1621 \u2013 less than half the time it had taken her to sail to America. Among the 102 passengers were six Essex residents from the Great Burstead area, south-west of Harwich. These included Christopher Martin, the Mayflower's treasurer who was responsible for provisioning the ship, his wife, step-son and servant, together with two single men from Great Burstead \u2013 Peter Browne and Richard Britteridge. All died that first winter in Plymouth except Peter Browne. After Jones' return from New England, by the summer of 1621 he had resumed his former trading voyages to continental Europe. But by this time it had become evident that the severe deprivations of the Pilgrim voyage had badly undermined his health, as it had so many other Mayflower voyagers. ", "The Pilgrims had originally hoped to reach America by early October using two ships, but delays and complications meant they could use only one, Mayflower. Arriving in November, they had to survive unprepared through a harsh winter. As a result, only half of the original Pilgrims survived the first winter at Plymouth. If not for the help of local indigenous peoples to teach them food gathering and other survival skills, all of the colonists might have perished. The following year, those 53 who survived celebrated the colony's first fall harvest along with 90 Wampanoag Native American people, an occasion declared in centuries later the first American Thanksgiving. Before disembarking the Mayflower, the Pilgrims wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact, an agreement that established a rudimentary government, in which each member would contribute to the safety and welfare of the planned settlement. As one of the earliest colonial vessels, the ship has become a cultural icon in the history of the United States. ", "It was before setting anchor that the male Pilgrims and non-Pilgrim passengers (whom members of the congregation referred to as 'Strangers') drew up and signed the Mayflower Compact.:\u200a54\u200a Among the resolutions in the Compact were those establishing legal order and meant to quell increasing strife within the ranks. Myles Standish was selected to make sure the rules were obeyed, as there was a consensus that discipline would need to be enforced to ensure the survival of the planned colony.:\u200a54\u200a Once they agreed to settle and build a self-governing community, they came ashore. The moment the Pilgrims stepped ashore was described by William Bradford, the second Governor of the Plymouth Colony: ", "At the end of November, Captain Jones led an expedition by open boat, exploring the harsh snow-covered coastline to find a suitable site for the colony. They came across buried corn and burial sites in an abandoned village, Patuxet.

Only around 50 passengers survived, along with just half the crew. A postcard of \u2018The Landing of the Pilgrims\u2019 taken from a painting by Charles Lucy. Public Domain. ", "The pilgrims, in this case, were people who believed life in the Western part of the world to be one of the New World \u2013 where opportunities could be found in larger capacities and where they were free from religious persecution. Men, women and children comprised the 102 passengers in the Mayflower ship that undertook the journey and created a place for itself in the pages of world history. These people thought that the Church of England had begun systematic oppression and wished to leave England for this reason. They were also called separationists since they disagreed with King Henry VIII on the powers and operations of the Church. ", "Of the many pilgrims on board the Mayflower, two noted individuals were William Bradford and Miles Standish. They served as the Second Governor and First Military Commander at the newly established Plymouth colony. Another person was Edward Winslow, a separatist leader and a skilled diplomat. He was instrumental in brokering peace between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe. After the trans-Atlantic crossing, the ship returned to England on May 6th 1621, after setting sail from the United States on the 5th of the previous month. After this journey and the death of its Captain and owner Christopher Jones in 1622, the ship was sent for an Admiralty appraisal because it was unused due to its dilapidated condition. ", "The Mayflower set sail on 16th September 1620 from Plymouth, UK, to voyage to America. But its history and story start long before that. Its passengers were in search of a new life \u2013 some seeking religious freedom, others a fresh start in a different land. They would go on to be known as the Pilgrims and influence the future of the United States of America in ways they could never have imagined. This story isn't just about the Mayflower's passengers though. It's about the people who already lived in America and the enormous effect the arrival of these colonists would have on Native Americans and the land they had called home for centuries. More than 30 million people can trace their ancestry to the 102 passengers and approximately 30 crew aboard the Mayflower when it landed in Plymouth Bay, Massachusetts, in the harsh winter of 1620. On board were men, women and children from different walks of life across England and the city of Leiden in Holland.

The two groups of people had worked together, and the feast (big celebratory meal) was a way to share and enjoy the harvest together.Today, Thanksgiving has a slightly different meaning for people. For many, it\u2019s a holiday for spending time with their family and friends, and to remember to be thankful for what they have.Of course, Thanksgiving is also a time to eat\u2026 a lot!

{"ID": 291, "All Sources": ["The album encompasses a large spectrum of musical styles, while its lyrics often feature satirical or humorous commentary on American society and politics. It addresses themes of individualism, free will, censorship, the music industry and human sexuality, while criticizing government and religion, and satirizing Catholicism and Scientology. Joe's Garage is noted for its use of xenochrony, a recording technique that takes musical material (in this instance, guitar solos by Zappa from older live recordings) and overdubs them onto different, unrelated material. All solos on the album are xenochronous except for 'Crew Slut' and 'Watermelon in Easter Hay', a signature song that Zappa described as the best song on the album, and according to his son Dweezil, the best guitar solo his father ever played. After being released from his contractual obligations with Warner Bros. Records, Frank Zappa formed Zappa Records, a label distributed at that time by Phonogram Inc. He released the successful double album Sheik Yerbouti (1979, recorded 8/1977-2/1978), and began working on a series of songs for a follow-up album.:\u200a370\u200a The songs 'Joe's Garage' and 'Catholic Girls' were recorded with the intention that Zappa would release each as a single. Throughout the development of Joe's Garage, Zappa's band recorded lengthy jams which Zappa later formed into the album.:\u200a331\u200a The album also continued the development of xenochrony, a technique Zappa also featured on One Size Fits All (1975), in which aspects of older live recordings were utilized to create new compositions by overdubbing them onto studio recordings, or alternatively, selecting a previously recorded solo and allowing drummer Vinnie Colaiuta to improvise a new drum performance, interacting with the previously recorded piece. ", "The title track is noted as having an autobiographical aspect, as the character of Larry (as performed by Zappa himself) sings that the band plays the same song repeatedly because 'it sounded good to me'.:\u200a150\u200a In real life, Zappa said he wrote and played music for himself, his sole intended audience.:\u200a150\u200a The song also takes lyrical inspiration from bands playing in bars like The Mothers of Invention once had, and shady record deals Zappa had experienced in the past.:\u200a150\u200a In 'Joe's Garage', Joe finds that the music industry is 'not everything it is cracked up to be'.:\u200a151\u200a The song refers to a number of music fads, including new wave, heavy metal, disco and glitter rock, and is critical of the music industry of the late 1970s.:\u200a151 ", "'Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?' was written in the summer of 1978. Zappa's road manager, Phil Kaufman, alleged, that the song was written after Kaufman had asked that very question; within the context of the album's storyline, it is sung by Joe after he receives a sexually transmitted disease from Lucille, 'a girl, who works at the Jack in the Box'. The Central Scrutinizer continues to express the hypothesis that 'girls, music, disease, heartbreak [...] all go together.':\u200a155\u200a Halfway through the album's libretto, Zappa expressed the belief that governments believe that people are inherently criminals, and continue to invent laws, which gives states the legal grounds to arrest people, leading to the fictional criminalization of music which occurs towards the end of the album's storyline.:\u200a155 ", "One day, Mary skips the church club and goes to the Armory. She becomes a groupie for a band called Toad-O ('Crew Slut'). Eventually, Mary, unable to keep up with the band's laundry, is dumped in Miami.

It addresses themes of individualism, free will, censorship, the music industry and human sexuality, while criticizing government and religion, and satirizing Catholicism and Scientology. Joe's Garage is noted for its use of xenochrony, a recording technique that takes musical material (in this instance, guitar solos by Zappa from older live recordings) and overdubs them onto different, unrelated material. All solos on the album are xenochronous except for 'Crew Slut' and 'Watermelon in Easter Hay', a signature song that Zappa described as the best song on the album, and according to his son Dweezil, the best guitar solo his father ever played. After being released from his contractual obligations with Warner Bros. Records, Frank Zappa formed Zappa Records, a label distributed at that time by Phonogram Inc. He released the successful double album Sheik Yerbouti (1979, recorded 8/1977-2/1978), and began working on a series of songs for a follow-up album.:\u200a370\u200a The songs 'Joe's Garage' and 'Catholic Girls' were recorded with the intention that Zappa would release each as a single.

{"ID": 301, "All Sources": ["The final orders to attack Pearl Harbor were delivered to the ships by hand before they sailed on November 26th. Burke noted that, at the time, the U.S. had only broken Japan\u2019s diplomatic codes, not their naval codes. But even if the U.S. could read Japanese naval codes, there was no radio traffic to intercept. Japan set an internal deadline: If negotiations with the U.S. did not go as desired, Pearl Harbor would be attacked. They pushed the deadline to November 29th. Three days later, the Japanese high command sent the message, 'Climb Mount Niitaka,' to tell the listening Japanese carrier force to proceed with the attack. What unfolded in the days to come is the story we\u2019re more familiar with\u20142,403 Americans were killed,188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, and the heart of the Pacific Fleet was left sitting on the harbor\u2019s bottom. ", "The attack on Pearl Harbor[nb 3] was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii, in the United States, just before 8:00 a.m. (local time) on Sunday, December 7, 1941. At the time, the United States was a neutral country in World War II. The attack on Hawaii and other U.S. territories led the United States to formally enter World War II on the side of the Allies the day following the attack, on December 8, 1941. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI,[nb 4] and as Operation Z during its planning. The Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor was preceded by months of negotiations between the United States and Japan over the future of the Pacific. Japanese demands included that the United States end its sanctions against Japan, cease aiding China in the Second Sino-Japanese war, and allow Japan to access the resources of the Dutch East Indies. Anticipating a negative response, Japan sent out its naval attack groups in November 1941 just prior to receiving the Hull note\u2014which states the United States desire that Japan withdraw from China and French Indochina. Japan intended the attack as a preventive action. Its aim was to prevent the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the course of seven hours, Japan conducted coordinated attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island; and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The attack on Pearl Harbor started at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian time (6:18 p.m. GMT).[nb 5] The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft (including fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers) in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. Of the eight United States Navy battleships present, all were damaged and four were sunk. All but USS Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship,[nb 6] and one minelayer. More than 180 US aircraft were destroyed. A total of 2,393 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded, making it the deadliest event ever recorded in Hawaii. Important base installations, such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines were lost, and 129 servicemen killed. Kazuo Sakamaki, the commanding officer of one of the submarines, was captured. ", "Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the 'Southern Resource Area', the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally, began early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, then commanding Japan's Combined Fleet. He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command. Full-scale planning was underway by early spring 1941, primarily by Rear Admiral Ry\u016bnosuke Kusaka, with assistance from Commander Minoru Genda and Yamamoto's Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain Kameto Kuroshima. The planners studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively.[nb 9][nb 10] ", "The Japanese attack had several major aims. First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with the Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and enabling Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. The leaders of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) ascribed to Alfred Thayer Mahan's 'decisive battle' doctrine, especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships.

Hitler's declaration of war on the United States is seen by many historians as one of his greatest errors in judgment.

Seventy years ago, even as Japan's envoys to Washington were receiving last-minute instructions from Tokyo for their meeting with the U.S. secretary of state, Japanese aircraft carriers and battleships stealthily moved into position in the Pacific northwest of Hawaii. Most of the U.S. battleships in the Pacific were in port at Pearl Harbor, and U.S. fighter planes were clustered together on their airfield\u2014making easy targets for an enemy. American soldiers and sailors had enjoyed another peaceful Saturday night, and early risers were waking up to a sunny Sunday morning.

This event was a surprise attack by Japanese fighter planes attacking the United States Naval ships ultimately leading to a total of 2,403 deaths, both civilian and military.1 Many ships were damaged but at the end important supplies and many bases were left untouched leading to a relatively quick bounce back by the American military.

At the time, the United States was a neutral country in World War II. The attack on Hawaii and other U.S. territories led the United States to formally enter World War II on the side of the Allies the day following the attack, on December 8, 1941. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI,[nb 4] and as Operation Z during its planning. \u001b[96m[1] The Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor was preceded by months of negotiations between the United States and Japan over the future of the Pacific\u001b[0m. \u001b[96m[2] Japanese demands included that the United States end its sanctions against Japan, cease aiding China in the Second Sino-Japanese war, and allow Japan to access the resources of the Dutch East Indies\u001b[0m. Anticipating a negative response, Japan sent out its naval attack groups in November 1941 just prior to receiving the Hull note\u2014which states the United States desire that Japan withdraw from China and French Indochina. \u001b[96m[3] Japan intended the attack as a preventive action\u001b[0m. \u001b[96m[4] Its aim was to prevent the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States\u001b[0m. Over the course of seven hours, Japan conducted coordinated attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island; and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The attack on Pearl Harbor started at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian time (6:18 p.m. GMT).[nb 5] The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft (including fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers) in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. Of the eight United States Navy battleships present, all were damaged and four were sunk. All but USS Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship,[nb 6] and one minelayer. More than 180 US aircraft were destroyed. A total of 2,393 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded, making it the deadliest event ever recorded in Hawaii. Important base installations, such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines were lost, and 129 servicemen killed. Kazuo Sakamaki, the commanding officer of one of the submarines, was captured. ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor\nPreliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the 'Southern Resource Area', the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally, began early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, then commanding Japan's Combined Fleet. He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command. Full-scale planning was underway by early spring 1941, primarily by Rear Admiral Ry\u016bnosuke Kusaka, with assistance from Commander Minoru Genda and Yamamoto's Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain Kameto Kuroshima.

{"ID": 342, "All Sources": ["The first recorded use of rail transport in Great Britain is Sir Francis Willoughby\u2019s Wollaton Wagonway in Nottinghamshire, built between 1603 and 1604 to carry coal. As early as 1671, railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal.The primitive rails were superseded in 1793 when Benjamin Outram constructed a tramway with L-shaped flanged cast-iron plate rails (plateways). Outram\u2019s rails were superseded by William Jessop\u2019s cast iron edge rails. Cast iron rails had a propensity to break easily, and the short lengths soon became uneven. In 1820, John Birkenshaw introduced a method of rolling rails in greater lengths using wrought iron, which was used from then onward. The earliest railways were built and paid for by the owners of the mines they served. As railway technology developed, longer lines became possible, connecting mines with more distant transshipment points and promising lower costs. These longer lines often required public subscription to build and crossed over land not owned by the mine owners. As a result, they needed an Act of Parliament to build. The first line to obtain such an act, in 1758, was the Middleton Railway in Leeds. The first for public use and on cast iron rails was the Surrey Iron Railway, incorporated in 1799. The first passenger-carrying public railway was the Oystermouth Railway, authorized in 1807. The first steam railway locomotive was introduced by Richard Trevithick in 1804. Trevithick\u2019s designs proved that steam traction was a viable proposition, although the use of his locomotives was quickly abandoned as they were too heavy for the existing track. The first commercially successful steam locomotive was the twin cylinder Salamanca, designed by in 1812 by Matthew Murray using John Blenkinsop\u2019s patented design for rack propulsion for the Middleton Railway. The proprietors of Wylam Colliery wanted to abolish horse-drawn trains in favor of steam. Two models, Puffing Billy and Bl\u00fccher, were among the first successful designs. In 1821 an Act of Parliament was approved for a tramway between Stockton and Darlington.Traffic on the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR) was originally intended to be horse-drawn, but the Act was subsequently amended to allow the usage of steam locomotives. The railway was also empowered to carry passengers in addition to coal and general merchandise. The first public steam railway in Scotland was the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR), founded as company in 1823 but opened in 1830, was the world\u2019s first intercity passenger railway in which all the trains were timetabled and operated by steam locomotives. Further, horse-drawn traffic could use the Stockton and Darlington upon payment of a toll. To determine which locomotives would be suitable, the L&MR directors organized the Rainhill Trials. These were arranged as an open contest that would let them see all the locomotive candidates in action, with the choice to follow. The trials were won by Rocket, built by George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson. The Stephensons were accordingly given the contract to produce locomotives for the L&MR. The line opened in 1830 with termini at Liverpool Road, Manchester and Edge Hill, Liverpool. Key Terms rack and pinion railway ", "The railway system of Great Britain started with the building of local isolated wooden wagonways starting in the 1560s. A patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies developed in the late 18th century. These isolated links expanded during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network, although initially being run by over one hundred competing companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many of these were amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained. The period also saw a steady increase in government involvement, especially in safety matters, such as the Railway Inspectorate. ", "As early as 1671 railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal; the first of these was the Tanfield Wagonway. Many of these tramroads or wagon ways were built in the 17th and 18th centuries. They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses, enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously. The first public railway in the world was the Lake Lock Rail Road, a narrow gauge railway built near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. The early wooden railways were improved on in 1793 when Benjamin Outram constructed a mile-long tramway with L-shaped cast iron rails. These rails became obsolete when William Jessop began to manufacture cast iron rails without guiding ledges \u2013 the wheels of the carts had flanges instead. Cast iron is brittle and so the rails tended to break easily. Consequently, in 1820, John Birkenshaw introduced a method of rolling wrought iron rails, which were used from then onwards. The first passenger service was at Oystermouth in 1807, photograph from 1870 The first passenger-carrying public railway was opened by the Swansea and Mumbles Railway at Oystermouth in 1807, using horse-drawn carriages on an existing tramline. In 1802, Richard Trevithick designed and built the first (unnamed) steam locomotive to run on smooth rails. Salamanca of 1812 The first commercially successful steam locomotive was Salamanca, built in 1812 by John Blenkinsop and Matthew Murray for the 4 ft (1,219 mm) gauge Middleton Railway. Salamanca was a rack and pinion locomotive, with cog wheels driven by two cylinders embedded into the top of the centre-flue boiler. ", "That design persuaded the backers of the proposed Stockton and Darlington Railway to appoint Stephenson as Engineer for the line in 1821. While traffic was originally intended to be horse-drawn, Stephenson carried out a fresh survey of the route to allow steam haulage. The Act was subsequently amended to allow the usage of steam locomotives and also to allow passengers to be carried on the railway. The 25-mile (40 km) long route opened on 27 September 1825 and, with the aid of Stephenson's Locomotion No. 1, was the first locomotive-hauled public railway in the world. 1830\u20131922: Early development Main article: History of rail transport in Great Britain 1830\u20131922 Frith's The Railway Station, 1862 depiction of Paddington railway station in London ", "The railway opened in 1830 amidst teeming crowds, sparking a revolution in trade and travel that spread around the world.

Why a railway? Goods traffic was at an all-time high between Liverpool and Manchester in the 1820s. Liverpool was the country's main port for raw cotton, and Manchester's mills devoured as much of it as they could, sending heaps of finished textiles back to Liverpool and out across the world. But journeys between these two hubs of manufacturing and trade were expensive and slow. Goods would arrive in a shorter time from New York to Liverpool than they could afterwards be conveyed from Liverpool to Manchester.

As early as 1671, railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal.The primitive rails were superseded in 1793 when Benjamin Outram constructed a tramway with L-shaped flanged cast-iron plate rails (plateways). Outram\u2019s rails were superseded by William Jessop\u2019s cast iron edge rails. Cast iron rails had a propensity to break easily, and the short lengths soon became uneven. In 1820, John Birkenshaw introduced a method of rolling rails in greater lengths using wrought iron, which was used from then onward. The earliest railways were built and paid for by the owners of the mines they served. As railway technology developed, longer lines became possible, connecting mines with more distant transshipment points and promising lower costs. These longer lines often required public subscription to build and crossed over land not owned by the mine owners. As a result, they needed an Act of Parliament to build. The first line to obtain such an act, in 1758, was the Middleton Railway in Leeds. The first for public use and on cast iron rails was the Surrey Iron Railway, incorporated in 1799. The first passenger-carrying public railway was the Oystermouth Railway, authorized in 1807. The first steam railway locomotive was introduced by Richard Trevithick in 1804. Trevithick\u2019s designs proved that steam traction was a viable proposition, although the use of his locomotives was quickly abandoned as they were too heavy for the existing track. The first commercially successful steam locomotive was the twin cylinder Salamanca, designed by in 1812 by Matthew Murray using John Blenkinsop\u2019s patented design for rack propulsion for the Middleton Railway. The proprietors of Wylam Colliery wanted to abolish horse-drawn trains in favor of steam. Two models, Puffing Billy and Bl\u00fccher, were among the first successful designs. In 1821 an Act of Parliament was approved for a tramway between Stockton and Darlington.Traffic on the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR) was originally intended to be horse-drawn, but the Act was subsequently amended to allow the usage of steam locomotives. The railway was also empowered to carry passengers in addition to coal and general merchandise. The first public steam railway in Scotland was the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR), founded as company in 1823 but opened in 1830, was the world\u2019s first intercity passenger railway in which all the trains were timetabled and operated by steam locomotives. Further, horse-drawn traffic could use the Stockton and Darlington upon payment of a toll. To determine which locomotives would be suitable, the L&MR directors organized the Rainhill Trials. These were arranged as an open contest that would let them see all the locomotive candidates in action, with the choice to follow. The trials were won by Rocket, built by George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson. The Stephensons were accordingly given the contract to produce locomotives for the L&MR. The line opened in 1830 with termini at Liverpool Road, Manchester and Edge Hill, Liverpool. Key Terms rack and pinion railway ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_Great_Britain\nThe railway system of Great Britain started with the building of local isolated wooden wagonways starting in the 1560s. A patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies developed in the late 18th century. These isolated links expanded during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network, although initially being run by over one hundred competing companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many of these were amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained. The period also saw a steady increase in government involvement, especially in safety matters, such as the Railway Inspectorate. ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_Great_Britain\nAs early as 1671 railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal; the first of these was the Tanfield Wagonway. Many of these tramroads or wagon ways were built in the 17th and 18th centuries. They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses, enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously. The first public railway in the world was the Lake Lock Rail Road, a narrow gauge railway built near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. The early wooden railways were improved on in 1793 when Benjamin Outram constructed a mile-long tramway with L-shaped cast iron rails. These rails became obsolete when William Jessop began to manufacture cast iron rails without guiding ledges \u2013 the wheels of the carts had flanges instead. Cast iron is brittle and so the rails tended to break easily. Consequently, in 1820, John Birkenshaw introduced a method of rolling wrought iron rails, which were used from then onwards. The first passenger service was at Oystermouth in 1807, photograph from 1870 The first passenger-carrying public railway was opened by the Swansea and Mumbles Railway at Oystermouth in 1807, using horse-drawn carriages on an existing tramline. In 1802, Richard Trevithick designed and built the first (unnamed) steam locomotive to run on smooth rails. Salamanca of 1812 The first commercially successful steam locomotive was Salamanca, built in 1812 by John Blenkinsop and Matthew Murray for the 4 ft (1,219 mm) gauge Middleton Railway. Salamanca was a rack and pinion locomotive, with cog wheels driven by two cylinders embedded into the top of the centre-flue boiler.

Disney's Steamboat Willie made a splash on the scene when it became the first animated film to use synchronized sound. A year prior, The Jazz Singer would have been the first live-action feature-length film to utilize the new technology. Although rudimentary by today's standards, Steamboat Willie was groundbreaking in its time. And it would have been the first place that audiences were introduced to the now-famous figureheads of the entertainment giant. Walt Disney was the original voice of Mickey Mouse. Although in Steamboat Willie, Mickey and Minnie didn't have any lines but merely made noises reacting to their situations, Walt was particular about Mickey. Disney animation director Lauren MacMullan said in an interview, 'There\u2019s something about Walt\u2019s voice from that era that is sort of innocent . . . In later years, Mickey\u2019s voice is easily parody-able. But this early Mickey sounds like he means it.' Walt would go on to voice Mickey in over 100 shorts and on into the 1940s.

He was also the voice actor for Jaq and Gus in Cinderella, the Dormouse in Alice in Wonderland, and Chip and Dale in some of their film shorts. He voiced Mickey for different films and television specials until 1976 when he retired. The third voice for Mickey debuted in 1977, with Wayne Allwine. His voice is the one we all probably know the best, as his voice starred in films such as A Goofy Movie, Mickey\u2019s Once Upon a Christmas, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Fantasia 2000, and many more.

Before 1931, two similar awards were issued\u2014the League Award was issued during 1922\u20131928 in the American League and during 1924\u20131929 in the National League, and during 1911\u20131914, the Chalmers Award was issued to a player in each league. Criteria and a list of winners for these two earlier awards are detailed in below sections. MVP voting takes place before the postseason, but the results are not announced until after the World Series. The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each league city in 1938, reducing that number to two per league city in 1961. The BBWAA does not offer a clear-cut definition of what 'most valuable' means, instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters. In 1944, the award was named after Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the first Commissioner of Baseball, who served from 1920 until his death on November 25, 1944. Formally named the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award, that naming appeared on a plaque given to winning players. Starting in 2020, Landis' name no longer appears on the MVP plaque after the BBWAA received complaints from several former MVP winners about Landis' role against the integration of MLB. First basemen, with 35 winners, have won the most MVPs among infielders, followed by second basemen (16), third basemen (15), and shortstops (15). Of the 25 pitchers who have won the award, 15 are right-handed while 10 are left-handed. Walter Johnson, Carl Hubbell, and Hal Newhouser are the only pitchers who have won multiple times, with Newhouser winning consecutively in 1944 and 1945. Hank Greenberg, Stan Musial, Alex Rodriguez, and Robin Yount have won at different positions, while Rodriguez is the only player who has won the award with two different teams at two different positions. Rodriguez and Andre Dawson are the only players to win the award while on a last-place team, the 2003 Texas Rangers and 1987 Chicago Cubs, respectively. Barry Bonds has won the most often (seven times) and the most consecutively (four from 2001 to 2004). Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win multiple times \u2013 10 players have won three times, and 19 have won twice. Frank Robinson is the only player to win the award in both the American and National Leagues. The award's only tie occurred in the National League in 1979, when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received an equal number of points. There have been 19 unanimous winners, who received all the first-place votes. The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 23, followed by the St. Louis Cardinals with 21 winners. The award has never been presented to a member of the following three teams: Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Mets, and Tampa Bay Rays. In recent decades, pitchers have rarely won the award. When Shohei Ohtani won the AL award in 2021, he became the first pitcher in either league to be named the MVP since Clayton Kershaw in 2014, and the first in the American League since Justin Verlander in 2011. Ohtani also became the first two-way player to win the award  and in 2023, he became the first player in MLB history to win MVP by unanimous vote twice. Since the creation of the Cy Young Award in 1956, he is the only pitcher to win an MVP award without winning a Cy Young in the same year (Don Newcombe, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Denny McLain, Vida Blue, Rollie Fingers, Willie Hern\u00e1ndez, Roger Clemens, Dennis Eckersley, Justin Verlander, and Clayton Kershaw all won a Cy Young award in their MVP seasons). ", "The Most Valuable Player, originating in 1930, is by far the oldest award. And little by little, the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America has added more accolades into the mix, from Manager of the Year to Gold Gloves. While it\u2019s not uncommon for stars to win a league accolade once in their career, it\u2019s rare for one to nab these awards more than once. Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels is the only active player to have won three MLB MVP Awards. Bryce Harper of the Philadelphia Phillies is right behind him with two. And two-way player Shohei Ohtani is on the prowl for more. In the 2022 season, Major League Baseball saw a pair of repeat winners. Ace Justin Verlander won his third Cy Young Award, and New York Mets\u2019 skipper Buck Showalter won his fourth Manager of the Year Award. ", "MLB Most Valuable Player MVP Award Winners The Most Valuable Player Award is given annually to one player in each league. The award began in 1911 as the Chalmers Award, honoring the 'most important and useful player to the club and to the league'. This award was discontinued in 1914. From 1922 to 1928 in the American League and from 1924 to 1929 in the National League, an MVP award was given to 'the baseball player who is of the greatest all-around service to his club'. Prior winners were not eligible to win the MVP award again during this time. The current incarnation of the MVP award was established in 1931. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) votes on the MVP award at the conclusion of each season ", "This was a season in the heart of the steroid era, and also the first back from the strike that cancelled the World Series. Baseball was at its nadir. Traditional metrics still ruled the day with their aged iron fist, with Bill James and his SABR boys just a small cadre of rebels and revolutionaries. Very Star Wars, if you think about it. The winner of the American League MVP was Mo Vaughn o the Boston Red Sox. It's not as if Vaughn didn't have good numbers, he hit .300/.388/.575 with 39 home runs and 126 RBIs. He also stole 11 bases that year, which if you know anything about Mo Vaughn, this is simply incredible. He was also nicer to the media. Not that that should count for anything, but it helped Vaughn. Instead of getting an award, all Belle got was a bigger chip on his shoulder. Perhaps that\u2019s why he broke down physically. You can only carry so much rage before you crack. ", "The National League was no better. Or worse, depending on how you look at it. Barry Larkin was the winner, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. Perhaps because he was the best, or at least biggest name, on a first place team Not to say he wasn\u2019t great, he was. But he only earned 5.9 wins above replacement. Even by traditional numbers, he slashed .319/.394/.492. That didn\u2019t lead to a batting title, and he hit 15 home runs. Even being a shortstop you\u2019d hope for more.

Portugal and Spain followed in 1986. In 1993, the European Union was created and Austria, Finland and Sweden joined 2 years later. This brought the EU\u2019s membership to 15. Soon after the Second World War, Europe was split into east and west by the \u2018iron curtain\u2019 as the 40-year-long Cold War began. The Berlin Wall was a symbol of this division as it split the city of Berlin in two. After the fall of communism in 1989, the formerly communist central and eastern European countries started a process of democratisation and applied to join the EU. In 2004, eight countries from central and eastern Europe joined the EU: Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. In the same year, the Mediterranean islands of Cyprus and Malta also became members. In 2007, Bulgaria and Romania joined, followed by Croatia in 2013. The addition of new EU members has expanded the common market and helped maintain peace and prosperity in Europe.

{"ID": 376, "All Sources": ["'The Death of Superman' is divided into three story arcs: 'Doomsday!', 'Funeral for a Friend', and 'Reign of the Supermen!'. The first arc chronicles Superman's fight with the monster Doomsday and concludes with his death. The second depicts Superman's fellow superheroes and the rest of the DC Universe mourning his death, ending with his adoptive father Jonathan Kent having a heart attack. The third sees the emergence of four Superman impostors before the original is resurrected. A number of characters in 'The Death of Superman', such as Doomsday, Superboy, the Cyborg Superman, Steel, and The Eradicator would recur in later DC publications. When news broke that DC planned to kill Superman, a beloved cultural icon, 'The Death of Superman' received unprecedented coverage from the mainstream media. Superman #75, which features Superman's death, sold over six million copies and became the top-selling comic of 1992. Retrospective reviewers are divided on the story, with some finding it ambitious and influential, while others dismiss it as a publicity stunt. The story has been adapted into various forms of media, including two novelizations in 1993 and a beat 'em up video game, The Death and Return of Superman, in 1994. A loose animated film adaptation, Superman: Doomsday, was released in 2007. A second animated adaptation was released as a two-part film, The Death of Superman and Reign of the Supermen, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Publication history Background Mike Carlin at San Diego Comic-Con in 2007. ", "Prior to moving forward, Carlin asked Siegel if he had any concerns with the concept of killing Superman. Siegel felt it was 'a good way to shake things up'; the teams felt better knowing he approved. Bogdanove recalled how the story 'almost began to write itself, from the end backwards. It felt like a story that could make the readers care again, the way we had always cared about Superman'. 'The Death of Superman' forced DC to cancel a non-canon, four-issue limited series Neil Gaiman and Matt Wagner were working on, as it also featured the character's death. The initial plan called for Superman to be killed in Superman #75 (January 1993) and resurrected in The Adventures of Superman #500, as both were milestone issues. Dan Jurgens in 2018. ", "'The Death of Superman' was first alluded to in Simonson's Superman: The Man of Steel #17 (November 1992); after the issue's story, a teaser panel shows Doomsday's fist repeatedly punching a wall. The crossover began the following issue, in which Doomsday is unleashed and begins to carve a brutal path of destruction across America. This leads to Superman's death in Superman #75, which DC published on November 18, 1992. There were several variants of issue #75: a standard newsstand edition; a direct market edition; and a collector's edition sold in a polybag with a black armband, poster, stickers, and a trading card, which cost more than the standard edition. Following the in-comics funeral, all the Superman publications went on hiatus until the release of The Adventures of Superman #500. Like Superman #75, collector's editions of The Adventures of Superman #500 came in polybags. One version had a translucent white bag with the red Superman logo, while another came in a black bag with a white logo. Each installment of the story received a second printing. ", "DC published the story in three collected volumes from 1992 to 1993: The Death of Superman, World Without a Superman, and The Return of Superman. The Death of Superman was released in time for the 1992 Christmas shopping season and, according to comics historian Matthew K. Manning, is the bestselling trade paperback of all time. Reprints of these collections were published in 2003, 1998, and 2004, respectively, while a recolored edition of The Death of Superman was released in 2013. In September 2007, DC released an omnibus edition of the story, The Death and Return of Superman Omnibus. It features all the issues from previous collections along with 40 pages dedicated to promotional materials and interviews, for a total of 784 pages. Jurgens also contributed new cover art. A new version of the omnibus edition was published in 2013, while another reissue was released in 2019. 'The Death of Superman' is divided into a trilogy of story arcs; the first is known as 'Doomsday!', which leads to Superman's death at the hands of Doomsday. The second story arc, 'Funeral for a Friend', which focuses on the immediate aftermath of Superman's death, began with The Adventures of Superman #498 (January 1993). The final story arc, 'Reign of the Supermen!', began with a prologue in The Adventures of Superman #500 and introduced the Supermen. The title of this arc references Siegel and Shuster's first Superman story, 'The Reign of the Superman'. It crosses into the larger DC Universe, with Green Lantern #46 (October 1993) featuring a tie-in story. Despite the gap between the releases of 'Funeral for a Friend' and 'Reign of the Supermen!', no time passed within the continuity of the comics. 'The Death of Superman' concluded in October 1993 with The Adventures of Superman #505, in which Superman returns to Metropolis. Characters ", "Superman's death stuns and traumatizes the residents of the DC Universe. His funeral is attended by nearly every superhero, as well as some supervillains, then President Bill Clinton, and First Lady Hillary Clinton. Every hero wears a black arm band featuring Superman's crest. After the funeral, Project Cadmus steals Superman's body from his mausoleum to clone him, but Lane and Supergirl recover it. With Superman gone, the crime rate rises; the costumed heroes of Metropolis, including a team funded by Luthor, rise to fill in as protectors but are insufficient. ", "In 2011, DC relaunched its entire comics line in an initiative called The New 52, which revamped the DC Universe and erased certain events. The relaunch altered Superman considerably, characterizing him as shorter-tempered and no longer married to Lois Lane. However, 'The Death of Superman' remained intact in the new DC Universe. To coincide with the release of the animated film adaptation of the crossover in 2018, a 12-part Death of Superman webcomic series began, written by Simonson and illustrated by Cat Staggs, Joel Ojeda, and Laura Braga, among others. The first parts chronicle Superman's actions hours before Doomsday kills him; later parts follow Jimmy Olsen during the confrontation and the aftermath of Superman's death. The 2019 one-shot Tales from the Dark Multiverse: The Death of Superman imagines a reality where Superman's death causes Lois Lane to have a psychological breakdown. Lois goes to the Fortress of Solitude and learns the Eradicator failed to restore Superman. Lois merges with the Eradicator and uses her new abilities to force the world to accept Superman's ideals. Her murder of criminals leads other heroes to oppose her, including the Cyborg Superman, Steel, and Superboy. Convinced she is correct, Lois fully adopts the identity of the Eradicator. Adaptations Stern wrote a novelization of 'The Death of Superman', The Death and Life of Superman, in 1993. Additionally, Simonson wrote another adaptation, Superman: Doomsday & Beyond, around the same time. It features cover art by Alex Ross. ", "The DC Extended Universe series of films contains references to 'The Death of Superman', beginning with the appearance of Superman's black suit in Man of Steel (2013). The climax of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) draws narrative elements from 'Doomsday!'. In the film, Lex Luthor uses forbidden Kryptonian genetic engineering projects to combine General Zod's corpse with his own DNA, creating Doomsday. During their fight, Superman and Doomsday deliver killing blows, respectively, and both die. Jurgens received a 'Special Thanks' credit at the end of the film. In Justice League (2017), the black suit reappears as an Easter egg in a deleted scene. Costume designer Michael Wilkinson explained that director Zack Snyder planned to have Superman wear the suit when he was resurrected in the film, but scrapped the idea in pre-production. Superman wore the black suit in Snyder's 2021 director's cut of the film, Zack Snyder's Justice League.

The Vikings conducted summer training camp at Bemidji State University from 1961 to 1965. In 1966, the team moved to their training camp to Minnesota State University in Mankato. The training camp at Minnesota State was one of the longest continuously running training camp events in the NFL and is remembered as part of the golden era history of the team. The Vikings played their home games at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis from 1982 to 2013. The Vikings played their last game at the Metrodome on December 29, 2013, defeating the Detroit Lions 14\u201313 to end the season. Since the team's first season in 1961, the Vikings have had one of the highest winning percentages in the NFL. As of 2022, they have won at least three games in every season except in 1962, and are one of only seven NFL teams to win at least 15 games in a regular season. The Vikings have won one NFL Championship, in 1969, before the league's merger with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970. Since the merger, the team has qualified for the playoffs 28 times, third-most in the league (trailing only the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers). The team played in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX and XI, but failed to win any of them. In addition, they have lost in their last six NFC Championship Game appearances, stretching back to 1978. The Vikings have 15 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 1960s ", "The Vikings won the Central Division again in 1974 with a 10\u20134 record. In the playoffs they built on their cold-weather reputation, defeating both the St. Louis Cardinals 30\u201314 and the Los Angeles Rams 14\u201310 in frozen Metropolitan Stadium. The Vikings played in their second straight Super Bowl, Super Bowl IX (3rd overall), losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 16\u20136, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans on January 12, 1975. Led by Tarkenton and running back Chuck Foreman, the 1975 Vikings got off to a 10\u20130 start and easily won another division title. However, the Vikings lost to the Dallas Cowboys in the playoffs, 17\u201314, on a controversial touchdown pass from the Cowboys' quarterback Roger Staubach to wide receiver Drew Pearson that became known as the Hail Mary. The touchdown was controversial because many felt that Pearson pushed off on Vikings defensive back Nate Wright, committing pass interference. As the Metropolitan Stadium crowd was stunned to learn that no penalty was called, debris was thrown on the field for several minutes. A Corby's Whiskey bottle struck game official Armen Terzian, rendering him unconscious. The Vikings played in Super Bowl XI, their third Super Bowl (fourth overall) in four years, against the Oakland Raiders at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on January 9, 1977. The Vikings, however, lost 32\u201314. In 1977, the Vikings again won the Central Division with a 9\u20135 record and advanced to their 4th NFC Championship Game in 5 years, but were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl Champion Cowboys, 23\u20136, at Texas Stadium. By 1978, age was taking its toll on the Vikings, but they still made the playoffs with an 8\u20137\u20131 record. There was no more playoff magic as the Rams finally defeated the Vikings, 34\u201310 in Los Angeles after having lost in their previous four playoff matchups (in 1969, '74, '76 and '77). Quarterback Fran Tarkenton retired following the season holding league passer records in attempts (6,467), completions (3,686), yards (47,003), and touchdowns (342).

In 18 seasons, he led the Vikings to a 158\u201396\u20135 regular-season record. Longtime Vikings assistant coach Jerry Burns was named the fourth head coach in team history on January 7, 1986. He served as the Vikings' offensive coordinator from 1968 to 1985, when the team won 11 division titles and played in four Super Bowls. In his first season, the Vikings, led by the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Tommy Kramer, went 9\u20137, their first winning record in four years.

The Vikings played the Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round on January 17, 2010, and won the game by a score of 34\u20133, advancing the Vikings to the NFC Championship game, the ninth in franchise history. This would also be the first NFC Championship game for the team since the 2000 season. Minnesota would travel to New Orleans the following week to face the top-seeded Saints in the first conference championship game held at the Superdome. Despite out-gaining the Saints on offense by nearly a twofold margin, the Vikings were severely hindered by five turnovers, including a Favre interception in the final minute of the fourth quarter in Saints territory. They were ousted in overtime, 31\u201328, as the Saints won the coin toss and kicked a 40-yard field goal on the first possession of overtime.[note 1] ", "In the 2013 season, the Vikings finished with five wins, ten losses, and one tie, with no road wins. Notable moments include acquired free agent Matt Cassel outplaying Christian Ponder at the quarterback position and the defense allowing a league-worst 480 points, coming within four points of matching the franchise's worst set in 1984.

Leslie Frazier was fired after the regular season ended. 2014\u20132019 The Vikings moved to U.S. Bank Stadium in 2016 The team hired former Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer to replace Leslie Frazier as head coach on January 16, 2014. Former Cleveland Browns offensive coordinator Norv Turner replaced Bill Musgrave, and George Edwards replaced Alan Williams as defensive coordinator. In the 2014 NFL draft, the Vikings selected Anthony Barr, a linebacker out of UCLA, and Teddy Bridgewater, a quarterback out of the University of Louisville. Bridgewater would later lose the starting job to Matt Cassel only to become the starter for the Vikings when Cassel was lost to a season-ending foot injury in week 3. Star running back Adrian Peterson only played in one regular-season game due to his ongoing child abuse trial, with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell placing Peterson on the Commissioner's Exempt List indefinitely. On April 16, 2015, the league released a statement issuing Peterson's reinstatement to occur on April 17, 2015.

{"ID": 381, "All Sources": ["A Change Is Gonna Come \u2013 365 Days of Aretha Franklin Skip to content 365 Days of Aretha Franklin An Aretha Franklin Song A Day Home Contact A Change Is Gonna Come December 11, 2019 Andrew Martone Uncategorized One comment Closing out her magnanimous 1967 debut for Atlantic Records, I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You, Aretha Franklin covered of one of the most powerful cuts of the 1960\u2019s: Sam Cooke\u2019s 'A Change Is Gonna Come.' Naturally, from the opening line, Aretha put her own spin on it. 'There\u2019s an old friend that, I once heard say, something that touched my heart. And it began this way,' Aretha sings while playing the piano in tribute to her late friend and idol. The history of 'A Change Is Gonna Come' is ever-storied. Sam Cooke wrote it in-part after hearing Bob Dylan\u2019s 'Blowin In The Wind.' He was also likely influenced by a recent racist experience he\u2019d endured. The song is heavy. The lush strings, horns, and bombastic timpani drums of Sam\u2019s original are nothing short of iconic. The arrangement is powerful. The ominous tone Sam lays evokes a lot of feeling. Sam performed the song but once, and the video of that performance is nowhere to be found across the web. He couldn\u2019t bare to perform it again, and his life was cut short not long after. ", "What\u2019s astonishing is that both live albums, as different as they are, are equally good performances. Cooke by this point was an artist who could perform in any style, and for any audience, and do it well. In November 1964, Cooke recorded a dance song, 'Shake', and he prepared a shortened edit of 'A Change is Gonna Come' to release as its B-side. The single was scheduled for release on December 22nd. Both sides charted, but by the time the single came out, Sam Cooke was dead. And from this point on, the story gets even more depressing and upsetting than it has been. ", "To listen to the song A Change Is Gonna Come (1964) closely for the first time \u2013 with your head touching the speakers and the crackle of electricity from the living room carpet humming beneath you \u2013 is to feel the potential of music made in protest. When I happened upon the song at the end of an otherwise average \u2018greatest hits\u2019 compilation, I began to understand how a piece of music can affect a feeling of transformation. The story about the song is that Cooke heard Bob Dylan sing Blowin\u2019 in the Wind (1963), and wrote A Change Is Gonna Come as a response and a call-out, both to Dylan and himself. The way Cooke saw it, a black man should be singing stuff like that, not some white kid from suburbia. By then, Cooke had crossed over from his gospel roots into mainstream success. He owned his own record label and controlled his career. But he lived with the paradoxes of black stardom. ", "'A Change is Gonna Come' was as cathartic a songwriting experience for Sam Cooke as it was transformative a song for anyone who has heard it. It is an allegorical civics tale, snugly wrapped in the soothing Balm of Gilead, mesmerizingly delivered by Sam Cooke\u2019s honey-drenched tenor. Fifty-four years after Sam\u2019s death, it continues to captivate Millennials and Baby Boomers alike. It knows no age, gender or racial barriers, though undoubtedly, as the Anthem of the Civil Rights Movement for which it was intended, its uplifting qualities, and soulful inspiration remain boundless. Of this, Sam Cooke would be most proud. B.G.

Cooke's new manager, Allen Klein, was infatuated with the song and persuaded Cooke to do away with promoting his most recent single, 'Ain't That Good News', and perform 'Change' instead, feeling that that was the statement he needed to make before a national audience. Cooke objected, noting that the album's release was a month away and that he had no time to pull together an arrangement within such a short time frame. Klein arranged for RCA to pay for a full string section and Cooke performed the song that Friday on The Tonight Show after performing 'Basin Street'. An NBC timekeeper logged down the number as 'It's a Long Time Coming,' but the network did not save the tape of the performance. Klein and Alexander both felt it would become a milestone moment in Cooke's career, but it was overshadowed by the Beatles' performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS just two days later. ", "Cooke was arrested and jailed, along with several of his entourage, for disturbing the peace. \u2018A Change Is Gonna Come\u2019 was written sometime in the next month, before being recorded in February 1964.  After the session, writes Guralnick, Cooke played the song for Bobby Womack: When he first played it for Bobby Womack, who was his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, he said, \u2018What\u2019s it sound like?\u2019 And Bobby said, \u2018It sounds like death.\u2019 Sam said, \u2018Man, that\u2019s kind of how it sounds like to me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m never going to play it in public.\u2019 And Bobby sort of rethought it and said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not like death, but it sounds kind of spooky. You could call it that. When \u2018A Change Is Gonna Come\u2019 was finally released as a single, it was eleven days after Cooke had been shot and killed at a Los Angeles motel, in what was later ruled a justifiable homicide. ", "Cooke first performed \u2018A Change Is Gonna Come\u2019 on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and after that decided to never perform the song again because of the complexity of the arrangement and the ominous nature of the lyrics. In December 1964, an edited version of the song was prepared for single release, but just two weeks before the song\u2019s release, Cooke was fatally shot at a Los Angeles hotel. The civil rights movement immediately picked up on the song and it became one of several anthems of the movement. Though it was only a modest hit for Cooke in comparison to his previous singles, \u2018A Change Is Gonna Come\u2019, is considered one of Cooke\u2019s greatest and most influential compositions. It\u2019s legacy is long and enduring because despite its melancholy, it has a universal message of hope that is timeless. Cooke\u2019s lyrics, not only goes hand in hand with Dr King\u2019s \u2018I Have A Dream\u2019 speech but can be adapted to whatever goal or movement of the time.

The series was created by the Duffer Brothers, who also serve as executive producers along with Shawn Levy and Dan Cohen. This season stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Cara Buono, and Matthew Modine, with Noah Schnapp, Joe Keery, and Shannon Purser in recurring roles. The first season of Stranger Things was widely praised, in particular for its originality, homages to the 1980s, characterization, tone, visuals, and acting (particularly those of Ryder, Harbour, Wolfhard, Brown and Modine). Premise ", "The first season's original soundtrack, consisting of 75 songs from Dixon and Stein split across two volumes, was released by Lakeshore Records. Digital release and streaming options were released on August 10 and 19, 2016 for the two volumes, respectively, while retail versions were available on September 16 and 23, 2016. In addition to original music, Stranger Things features period music from artists including The Clash, Toto, New Order, The Bangles, Foreigner, Echo and the Bunnymen, Peter Gabriel and Corey Hart, as well as excerpts from Tangerine Dream, John Carpenter and Vangelis. In particular, The Clash's 'Should I Stay or Should I Go' was specifically picked to play at pivotal moments of the story, such as when Will is trying to communicate with Joyce from the Upside Down. Music supervisor Nora Felder felt the song 'furthered the story' and called it an additional, unseen, main character of the season. Release As Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the season based on people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, within the first 35 days of release, Stranger Things averaged ratings of around 14.07 million adults between the ages of 18 and 49 in the United States. This made it the third most-watched season of Netflix original content in the U.S. at the time behind the first season of Fuller House and fourth season of Orange Is the New Black. In a September 2016 analysis, Netflix found that Stranger Things 'hooked' viewers by the second episode of the first season, indicating that the second episode was 'the first installment that led at least 70 percent of viewers who watched that episode to complete the entire first season of a show.' ", "Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 97% based on 92 reviews and a weighted average score of 8.2/10.

Review aggregator Metacritic gave the first season a normalized score of 76 out of 100 based on 34 reviews, indicating 'generally favorable reviews'.

{"ID": 406, "All Sources": ["City Dionysia - Masks, Costumes and Props I. Overview II. Masks, Costumes & Props III. Contemporary Players Masks, Costumes & Props Masks Masks served several important purposes in Ancient Greek theater: their exaggerated expressions helped define the characters the actors were playing; they allowed actors to play more than one role (or gender); they helped audience members in the distant seats see and, by projecting sound somewhat like a small megaphone, even hear the characters better. In a tragedy, masks were more life-like; in a comedy or satyr play, masks were ugly and grotesque. Masks were constructed out of lightweight materials such as wood, linen, cork, and sometimes real hair. Unfortunately, they lacked durability, and none has survived. Costumes Costumes, along with masks and props, helped indicate the social status, gender, and age of a character. Athenian characters wore more elaborate, decorated versions of everyday clothing, such as a tunic or undergarment (chit\u00f4n or peplos), a cloak or over-garment (himation). Costumes for characters that were non-Athenians were more outlandish. Tragic actors wore buskins (raised platform shoes) to symbolize superior status, while comic actors wore plain socks. When depicting women, actors wore body stockings, with a progastreda and a prosterneda to make their bodies appear feminine. Some plays even called for actors to wear animal costumes. Props In addition to masks, actors also used props to create a character. These could be a crown to represent a king; a lyre for a musician; a walking stick to suggest age; a caduceus for a messenger; spears and helmets to suggest military men. ", "The Ancient Greek term for a mask is prosopon (lit., 'face'), and was a significant element in the worship of Dionysus at Athens likely used in ceremonial rites and celebrations. Many masks worshipped the higher power, the gods, making masks also very important for religion. Most of the evidence comes from only a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC, such as one showing a mask of the god suspended from a tree with decorated robe hanging below it and dancing and the Pronomos vase, which depicts actors preparing for a satyr play. No physical evidence remains available to us, as the masks were made of organic materials and not considered permanent objects, ultimately being dedicated at the altar of Dionysus after performances.
