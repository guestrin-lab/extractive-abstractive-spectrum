0,24,"[""The initial treatment for a stress fracture is to elevate the extremity and rest while the bone heals itself. Ice the affected area for 24 to 48 hours and reduce your activity. For pain, you may use NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. Depending on which bone is involved, your doctor may recommend a splint or cast to immobilize the affected area. When the swelling has decreased to the point you can see skin creases, you can begin partially putting weight on the area. In some cases, crutches or a cane is necessary. Usually, you can begin full weight-bearing at two weeks after the symptoms started, but don't do anything that causes pain. Weight-bearing stimulates healing. For the next six to eight weeks -- or until you're free of pain -- avoid the activity that caused the stress fracture, and avoid putting too much weight on the affected area. If you exercise again too soon, you could delay the healing process. You could even cause damage that may never heal properly. When you are ready to return to the activity, do it slowly.

1,33,"['When your doctor tells you that you have prediabetes, you might think there\'s no reason to take action just yet. Or you might assume that you\'re definitely going to get diabetes. Not so! You do need to take prediabetes seriously, but there\'s still time to turn things around -- if you start now. The goal is to get your blood sugar level out of the prediabetes range, and keep it that way. What you do every day makes a big difference. Making lifestyle changes may be even more powerful than just taking medication. That\'s what happened in a large study called the Diabetes Prevention Program: People with prediabetes who lost a small amount of weight through diet and exercise cut their odds of getting type 2 diabetes by 58%, compared to 31% for people who only took the prescription drug metformin. Start by making these three changes. If you\'re overweight, slimming down is the key to turning the odds in your favor. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. To reach your goal, limit portion sizes; cut calories; and eat fewer foods that are high in fat (especially saturated fat), sugar, and carbohydrates. You should also eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Leading an active life is a must. Aim for 30 minutes of aerobic activity (something that raises your heart rate, like walking, biking, or swimming) 5 days a week (150 minutes per week). Plus, do some strength-training exercise, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, at least twice a week. Strength work builds muscle, which helps lower your blood sugar level, helps your body respond better to insulin (which controls blood sugar), and burns calories even when you\'re not moving. Smoking is strongly linked to diabetes: People who smoke are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who don\'t. And people with diabetes who continue smoking are more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and blindness. So the sooner you ditch the cigarettes, the better. While lifestyle changes can work wonders, some people with prediabetes also need medication. Your doctor may prescribe metformin if you have certain risk factors, such as low levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol, high triglycerides (a type of blood fat), a parent or sibling with diabetes, or are overweight. If you take metformin, you\'ll need to follow up with your doctor. You\'ll also need to keep up a healthy lifestyle.

It helps make the outer membranes of our bodies\' cells stable. But for decades, doctors have known that people with high total cholesterol levels are more likely to get heart disease. More recently, they\'ve found the different forms of cholesterol (""good"" and ""bad"") also play a role. High total cholesterol, high bad cholesterol, or low good cholesterol could raise your chances. For example, LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol can stick to blood vessel walls. Over years, it can play a role in clogging arteries in a process called atherosclerosis. Narrowed arteries in your heart can then develop sudden blood clots, causing heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends that everyone over age 20 get a cholesterol test so you know what your levels are and can do something about them if you need to. The different kinds of cholesterol and other fats in your blood are together called lipids. Doctors measure and diagnose lipid problems with a simple blood test. You\'ll probably have to fast for 9 to 12 hours before it to make sure it\'s not affected by any food you recently ate. A lipid profile usually gives results for four different types: Total cholesterol LDL (low-density lipoprotein), the ""bad cholesterol"" HDL (high-density lipoprotein), the ""good cholesterol"" Triglycerides, another form of fat Some lipid panels can give even more detailed information, like the presence and sizes of various fat particles in your blood. Researchers are looking into what, if any, effect these traits have on heart disease. There\'s no clear guidelines on when this more advanced testing is needed. So you\'ve gone hungry overnight, endured a small bloodletting, and dutifully returned to get your results. Now, what do the numbers mean? For total cholesterol: 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) or less is normal. 201 to 240 mg/d L is borderline. More than 240 mg/d L is high. For HDL (""good cholesterol""), more is better: 60 mg/d L or higher is good -- it protects against heart disease. 40 to 59 mg/d L is OK. Less than 40 mg/d L is low, raising your chance of heart disease. For LDL (""bad cholesterol""), lower is better: Less than 100 mg/d L is ideal. 100 to 129 mg/d L can be good, depending on your health. 130 to 159 mg/d L is borderline high. 160 to 189 mg/d L is high. 190 mg/d L or more is very high. Your doctor will consider your overall likelihood of heart disease to set your personal LDL goal. For people at great risk of heart disease, or who already have it, your LDL should be less than 100 mg/d L. ( Your heart doctor might recommend an even lower LDL -- less than 70 mg/d L -- if your risk of heart disease is very high.) If you have a moderately high chance, an LDL less than 130 mg/d L is your target. If you\'re not likely to get heart disease, less than 160 mg/d L is probably fine. High triglycerides (150 mg/d L or greater) also raise the odds for heart disease somewhat. Lifestyle changes are the first thing to tackle to reduce your chance of heart disease. A cholesterol-lowering diet can bring down bad cholesterol by up to 30%. A diet low in saturated fat (7% of total calories or less) and no more than 200 mg of cholesterol daily can lower LDL cholesterol. Fiber and plant sterols (found in special margarines and other foods) help, too. Regular aerobic exercise can both lower bad cholesterol ( LDL) and raise good cholesterol ( HDL). If diet and exercise don\'t lower cholesterol levels enough, you can try medications or a combination of treatments including: Statins, the most effective and commonly used cholesterol drugs Niacin Fibrates Zetia Bile acid sequestrants Your cholesterol numbers don\'t determine your destiny.

It helps make the outer membranes of our bodies\' cells stable. But for decades, doctors have known that people with high total cholesterol levels are more likely to get heart disease. More recently, they\'ve found the different forms of cholesterol (""good"" and ""bad"") also play a role. High total cholesterol, high bad cholesterol, or low good cholesterol could raise your chances. For example, LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol can stick to blood vessel walls. Over years, it can play a role in clogging arteries in a process called atherosclerosis. Narrowed arteries in your heart can then develop sudden blood clots, causing heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends that everyone over age 20 get a cholesterol test so you know what your levels are and can do something about them if you need to. The different kinds of cholesterol and other fats in your blood are together called lipids. Doctors measure and diagnose lipid problems with a simple blood test. You\'ll probably have to fast for 9 to 12 hours before it to make sure it\'s not affected by any food you recently ate. A lipid profile usually gives results for four different types: Total cholesterol LDL (low-density lipoprotein), the ""bad cholesterol"" HDL (high-density lipoprotein), the ""good cholesterol"" Triglycerides, another form of fat Some lipid panels can give even more detailed information, like the presence and sizes of various fat particles in your blood. Researchers are looking into what, if any, effect these traits have on heart disease. There\'s no clear guidelines on when this more advanced testing is needed. So you\'ve gone hungry overnight, endured a small bloodletting, and dutifully returned to get your results. Now, what do the numbers mean? For total cholesterol: 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) or less is normal. 201 to 240 mg/d L is borderline. More than 240 mg/d L is high. For HDL (""good cholesterol""), more is better: 60 mg/d L or higher is good -- it protects against heart disease. 40 to 59 mg/d L is OK. Less than 40 mg/d L is low, raising your chance of heart disease. For LDL (""bad cholesterol""), lower is better: Less than 100 mg/d L is ideal. 100 to 129 mg/d L can be good, depending on your health. 130 to 159 mg/d L is borderline high. 160 to 189 mg/d L is high. 190 mg/d L or more is very high. Your doctor will consider your overall likelihood of heart disease to set your personal LDL goal. For people at great risk of heart disease, or who already have it, your LDL should be less than 100 mg/d L. ( Your heart doctor might recommend an even lower LDL -- less than 70 mg/d L -- if your risk of heart disease is very high.) If you have a moderately high chance, an LDL less than 130 mg/d L is your target. If you\'re not likely to get heart disease, less than 160 mg/d L is probably fine.

The types of insulin include: Rapid-acting Short-acting Intermediate-acting Long-acting Pre-mixed Your doctor will work with you to prescribe the type of insulin that\'s best for you and your diabetes. Making that choice will depend on many things, including: How you respond to insulin. ( How long it takes the body to absorb it and how long it remains active varies from person to person.) Lifestyle choices. The type of food you eat, how much alcohol you drink, or how much exercise you get will all affect how your body uses insulin. Your willingness to give yourself multiple injections per day How often you check your blood sugar Your age Your goals for managing your blood sugar Afrezza, a rapid-acting inhaled insulin, is FDA-approved for use before meals for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The drug peaks in your blood in about 15-20 minutes and it clears your body in 2-3 hours. It must be used along with long-acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes. The chart below lists the types of injectable insulin with details about onset (the length of time before insulin reaches the bloodstream and begins to lower blood sugar), peak (the time period when it best lowers blood sugar) and duration (how long insulin continues to work). These three things may vary. The final column offers some insight into the ""coverage"" provided by the different insulin types in relation to mealtime. Type of Insulin & Brand Names Onset Peak Duration Role in Blood Sugar Management Rapid- Acting Lispro ( Humalog) 15-30 min. 30-90 min 3-5 hours Rapid-acting insulin covers insulin needs for meals eaten at the same time as the injection.

This type of insulin is often combined with a rapid- or short-acting type. Long- Acting Insulin glargine ( Basaglar, Lantus, Toujeo) 1-1 1/2 hours No peak time. Insulin is delivered at a steady level. 20-24 hours Long-acting insulin covers insulin needs for about one full day. This type is often combined, when needed, with rapid- or short-acting insulin.

From the chart on page 1, the ""onset"" column shows when the insulin will begin to work in your body. You want that to happen at the same time you\'re absorbing food. Good timing will help you avoid low blood sugar levels. Rapid acting insulins: About 15 minutes before mealtime Short-acting insulins: 30 to 60 minutes before a meal Intermediate-acting insulins: Up to 1 hour prior to a meal Pre-mixed insulins: Depending on the product, between 10 minutes or 30 to 45 minutes before mealtime Long-acting insulins aren\'t tied to mealtimes.

Deglutec is taken once a day, and the time of day can be flexible. But some people do have to pair a long-acting insulin with a shorter-acting type or another medication that does have to be taken at meal time.

It helps make the outer membranes of our bodies\' cells stable. But for decades, doctors have known that people with high total cholesterol levels are more likely to get heart disease. More recently, they\'ve found the different forms of cholesterol (""good"" and ""bad"") also play a role. High total cholesterol, high bad cholesterol, or low good cholesterol could raise your chances. For example, LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol can stick to blood vessel walls. Over years, it can play a role in clogging arteries in a process called atherosclerosis. Narrowed arteries in your heart can then develop sudden blood clots, causing heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends that everyone over age 20 get a cholesterol test so you know what your levels are and can do something about them if you need to. The different kinds of cholesterol and other fats in your blood are together called lipids. Doctors measure and diagnose lipid problems with a simple blood test. You\'ll probably have to fast for 9 to 12 hours before it to make sure it\'s not affected by any food you recently ate. A lipid profile usually gives results for four different types: Total cholesterol LDL (low-density lipoprotein), the ""bad cholesterol"" HDL (high-density lipoprotein), the ""good cholesterol"" Triglycerides, another form of fat Some lipid panels can give even more detailed information, like the presence and sizes of various fat particles in your blood. Researchers are looking into what, if any, effect these traits have on heart disease. There\'s no clear guidelines on when this more advanced testing is needed. So you\'ve gone hungry overnight, endured a small bloodletting, and dutifully returned to get your results. Now, what do the numbers mean? For total cholesterol: 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) or less is normal. 201 to 240 mg/d L is borderline. More than 240 mg/d L is high. For HDL (""good cholesterol""), more is better: 60 mg/d L or higher is good -- it protects against heart disease. 40 to 59 mg/d L is OK. Less than 40 mg/d L is low, raising your chance of heart disease. For LDL (""bad cholesterol""), lower is better: Less than 100 mg/d L is ideal. 100 to 129 mg/d L can be good, depending on your health. 130 to 159 mg/d L is borderline high. 160 to 189 mg/d L is high. 190 mg/d L or more is very high. Your doctor will consider your overall likelihood of heart disease to set your personal LDL goal. For people at great risk of heart disease, or who already have it, your LDL should be less than 100 mg/d L. ( Your heart doctor might recommend an even lower LDL -- less than 70 mg/d L -- if your risk of heart disease is very high.) If you have a moderately high chance, an LDL less than 130 mg/d L is your target. If you\'re not likely to get heart disease, less than 160 mg/d L is probably fine. High triglycerides (150 mg/d L or greater) also raise the odds for heart disease somewhat. Lifestyle changes are the first thing to tackle to reduce your chance of heart disease. A cholesterol-lowering diet can bring down bad cholesterol by up to 30%. A diet low in saturated fat (7% of total calories or less) and no more than 200 mg of cholesterol daily can lower LDL cholesterol. Fiber and plant sterols (found in special margarines and other foods) help, too. Regular aerobic exercise can both lower bad cholesterol ( LDL) and raise good cholesterol ( HDL). If diet and exercise don\'t lower cholesterol levels enough, you can try medications or a combination of treatments including: Statins, the most effective and commonly used cholesterol drugs Niacin Fibrates Zetia Bile acid sequestrants Your cholesterol numbers don\'t determine your destiny. Remember, other things besides cholesterol can also lead to heart disease. Diabetes, smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, exercise, and genetics are important as well. People with normal cholesterol can have heart disease; people with high cholesterol can have healthy hearts. Overall, though, more people whose cholesterol levels are off will get heart disease.

6,33,"['When your doctor tells you that you have prediabetes, you might think there\'s no reason to take action just yet. Or you might assume that you\'re definitely going to get diabetes. Not so! You do need to take prediabetes seriously, but there\'s still time to turn things around -- if you start now. The goal is to get your blood sugar level out of the prediabetes range, and keep it that way. What you do every day makes a big difference. Making lifestyle changes may be even more powerful than just taking medication. That\'s what happened in a large study called the Diabetes Prevention Program: People with prediabetes who lost a small amount of weight through diet and exercise cut their odds of getting type 2 diabetes by 58%, compared to 31% for people who only took the prescription drug metformin. Start by making these three changes. If you\'re overweight, slimming down is the key to turning the odds in your favor. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. To reach your goal, limit portion sizes; cut calories; and eat fewer foods that are high in fat (especially saturated fat), sugar, and carbohydrates. You should also eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Leading an active life is a must. Aim for 30 minutes of aerobic activity (something that raises your heart rate, like walking, biking, or swimming) 5 days a week (150 minutes per week). Plus, do some strength-training exercise, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, at least twice a week. Strength work builds muscle, which helps lower your blood sugar level, helps your body respond better to insulin (which controls blood sugar), and burns calories even when you\'re not moving. Smoking is strongly linked to diabetes: People who smoke are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who don\'t. And people with diabetes who continue smoking are more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and blindness. So the sooner you ditch the cigarettes, the better. While lifestyle changes can work wonders, some people with prediabetes also need medication. Your doctor may prescribe metformin if you have certain risk factors, such as low levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol, high triglycerides (a type of blood fat), a parent or sibling with diabetes, or are overweight. If you take metformin, you\'ll need to follow up with your doctor. You\'ll also need to keep up a healthy lifestyle.

The goal is to get your blood sugar level out of the prediabetes range, and keep it that way. What you do every day makes a big difference.

Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset.

7,22,"[""They may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite. In fact, dogs bite about 4.7 million Americans every year, half of them children between ages 5 and 9. One out of every five of those bites causes an injury that requires medical attention, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Children are also more likely than adults to be injured by a dog bite. Although strays or other strange dogs can bite, most of the time people are actually bitten by a dog they know, which could be a friend's dog or even the family pet. To prevent dog bites: When choosing a dog for a family pet, pick one with a good temperament. Stay away from any dogs you don't know. Never leave young children alone with a dog -- especially an unfamiliar one. Don't try to play with any dog that is eating or feeding her puppies. Whenever you approach a dog, do so slowly,and give the dog the chance to approach you. If a dog becomes aggressive, do not run away or scream. Stay calm, move slowly, and don't make eye contact with the dog. Although you can provide first aid for a dog bite at home, it's very important to see a doctor, especially if an unfamiliar dog bit you, the bite is deep, you can't stop the bleeding, or there are any signs of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus). Dog bites can cause infections that need to be treated with antibiotics. To care for a dog bite injury at home: Place a clean towel over the injury to stop any bleeding. Try to keep the injured area elevated. Wash the bite carefully with soap and water. Apply a sterile bandage to the wound. Apply antibiotic ointment to the injury every day to prevent infection. When you visit the doctor, be prepared to answer a few questions, including: Do you know the owner of the dog? If so, is the dog up to date on all vaccinations, including rabies? Did the bite occur because the dog was provoked, or was the dog unprovoked? What health conditions do you have? People with diabetes, liver disease, illnesses that suppress the immune system, and other health conditions may be at greater risk for a more severe infection. Your doctor will examine the injury to see whether the bite was deep enough to damage muscles, tendons, nerves, or bones. Then the doctor will thoroughly clean the bite wound to remove any dirt or bacteria, and may also remove dead tissues from the wound. Sometimes, sutures are used to close a dog bite wound; however, this practice is controversial. Although suturing the injury can reduce scarring, it also can increase the risk of infection. Whether the injury is closed may depend on its location. For example, dog bites on the face may be sutured to prevent visible scars. Very deep wounds that cause a great deal of damage may require plastic surgery. Your doctor will also take measures to prevent infection. It's rare for dogs in the U. S. to have rabies, but if the dog's health status is unknown, or the dog tests positive for rabies, you will need to get a rabies vaccine. ( Bear in mind that the dog would have to be euthanized and their brain tested for rabies.) The doctor will also make sure that you are up to date on your tetanus shot. You may need to take antibiotics for seven to 14 days to prevent or treat an infection. The doctor may ask you to come back in one to three days to have the injury rechecked. If you did not know the dog that bit you, make sure to report the bite to your local animal control office or police.""]",['https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites'],"[""https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites\nThey may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite.

But the best one for you depends on different things. Your age, for instance -- some nonprescription products have age limits. Your insurance may pay only for a prescription. When you had sex can matter, too. Some products work for about 3 days after, some for 5. Your doctor or pharmacist can steer you in the right direction. The copper- T intrauterine device ( IUD) can work as emergency contraception. The IUD goes inside your body. If you want an IUD, a nurse or doctor needs to put it in within 5 days of when you had sex. The IUD works as both emergency contraception and as ongoing birth control. It prevents pregnancy as long as it is in place. The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception. . Ask your doctor if an IUD might be a good choice for you, especially if you already wanted long-term birth control. There are 3 types of emergency contraception in pill form that are sold both with and without a prescription. You need to be 17 to buy them if a prescription is needed. Depending on the brand and dose, you might get 1 pill or 2. 1. Pills containing a hormone called levonorgestrel: My Way (over-the-counter) Plan B One- Step (over-the-counter) Preventeza (over-the-counter) Take Action (over-the-counter) 2. Birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception, but you have to take more than one pill at a time to keep from getting pregnant. This approach works, but it is less effective and more likely to cause nausea than levonorgestrel. Birth control pills require a prescription. Talk to your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking the correct pills and dose. 3. A third kind of emergency contraception pill is called ulipristal (ella, ella One). You need a prescription to get it. Some meds and supplements -- such as the epilepsy drug Dilantin, antibiotics such as rifampicin or griseofulvin, and St. John's wort -- can stop emergency contraception pills from working normally. To be safe, tell your doctor or pharmacist about other drugs and supplements you take. Emergency birth-control pills and the IUD are safe for almost all women. But if you have medical problems and you're concerned that taking emergency contraception could be risky, talk to a doctor or pharmacist. The pills may not work as well for women who are overweight or obese. It may be awkward to discuss, but ask a pharmacist or doctor. If you're overweight, Ella may work better than Plan B One- Step and generic levonorgestrel. In general, the IUD seems to work better than pills for heavier women. You should use a regular form of birth control right away. Emergency contraception lasts only for about 24 hours and may just delay ovulation, not stop it. Make sure you're protected. Some types of emergency contraception may not be safe if you're already pregnant. Most pills won't harm your pregnancy. But you should not take Ella if you think you might be pregnant. It's not safe.

You may want to ask them: There are lots of good options. But the best one for you depends on different things. Your age, for instance -- some nonprescription products have age limits. Your insurance may pay only for a prescription. When you had sex can matter, too. Some products work for about 3 days after, some for 5. Your doctor or pharmacist can steer you in the right direction. The copper- T intrauterine device ( IUD) can work as emergency contraception. The IUD goes inside your body. If you want an IUD, a nurse or doctor needs to put it in within 5 days of when you had sex. The IUD works as both emergency contraception and as ongoing birth control. It prevents pregnancy as long as it is in place. The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception. . Ask your doctor if an IUD might be a good choice for you, especially if you already wanted long-term birth control. There are 3 types of emergency contraception in pill form that are sold both with and without a prescription. You need to be 17 to buy them if a prescription is needed. Depending on the brand and dose, you might get 1 pill or 2. 1. Pills containing a hormone called levonorgestrel: My Way (over-the-counter) Plan B One- Step (over-the-counter) Preventeza (over-the-counter) Take Action (over-the-counter) 2. Birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception, but you have to take more than one pill at a time to keep from getting pregnant. This approach works, but it is less effective and more likely to cause nausea than levonorgestrel. Birth control pills require a prescription. Talk to your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking the correct pills and dose. 3. A third kind of emergency contraception pill is called ulipristal (ella, ella One). You need a prescription to get it. \x1b[92m[2] Some meds and supplements -- such as the epilepsy drug Dilantin, antibiotics such as rifampicin or griseofulvin, and St\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] John's wort -- can stop emergency contraception pills from working normally\x1b[0m. To be safe, tell your doctor or pharmacist about other drugs and supplements you take. Emergency birth-control pills and the IUD are safe for almost all women. But \x1b[92m[1] if you have medical problems and you're concerned that taking emergency contraception could be risky, talk to a doctor or pharmacist\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] The pills may not work as well for women who are overweight or obese\x1b[0m. It may be awkward to discuss, but ask a pharmacist or doctor. \x1b[92m[5] If you're overweight, Ella may work better than Plan B One- Step and generic levonorgestrel\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] In general, the IUD seems to work better than pills for heavier women\x1b[0m.

10,34,"['Newborns tend to have an irregular breathing pattern that alternates between fast and slow, with occasional pauses. If your baby makes noises when breathing, take note of what they sound like. This will help determine if there is a problem in the breathing passages and where: Whistling noise: A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths. This is a good trick, as it allows them to breathe and eat at the same time. However, their little noses have small air passages, so a little bit of mucus or dried milk can make the breathing passage even smaller, causing a whistling noise or occasionally, difficulty moving the air in and out. Hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough: A blockage in the larynx (windpipe), often due to mucus, makes a hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough. This may be a sign of croup, an infection of the larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes. High-pitched, squeaky sound: Called stridor or laryngomalacia, this is a sound very young babies make when breathing in. It is worse when a child is lying on his or her back. It is caused by excess tissue around the larynx and is typically harmless. It typically passes by the time a child reaches age 2. Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on). Fast, labored breathing: Fluid in the smallest airways (the ""alveoli"") causes pneumonia, an infection due to a virus or bacteria. Pneumonia causes fast, labored breathing, occasionally cyanosis, a persistent cough, and crackly sounds (""rales"") when listened to with a stethoscope. Watch your baby\'s breathing when she\'s well, so you can get used to how it looks. Time how many breaths she takes in a minute. It\'s probably faster than you imagined. Knowing what\'s normal for your baby\'s breathing will help you spot a potential problem more quickly. When in doubt of what\'s going on, make a video of the breathing pattern that is worrying you to show to your baby\'s health care provider. Signs of potentially worrisome breathing problems in your baby include: Persistently increased rate of breathing (greater than 60 breaths per minute or so) Increased work to breathe. Signs of this include: Grunting. The baby makes a little grunting noise at the end of respiration. This serves to try to open up blocked airways. Flaring. The baby\'s nostrils flare during breathing, showing increased effort. Retractions.

If your baby makes noises when breathing, take note of what they sound like. This will help determine if there is a problem in the breathing passages and where: Whistling noise: A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths. This is a good trick, as it allows them to breathe and eat at the same time. However, their little noses have small air passages, so a little bit of mucus or dried milk can make the breathing passage even smaller, causing a whistling noise or occasionally, difficulty moving the air in and out. Hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough: A blockage in the larynx (windpipe), often due to mucus, makes a hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough. This may be a sign of croup, an infection of the larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes. High-pitched, squeaky sound: Called stridor or laryngomalacia, this is a sound very young babies make when breathing in. It is worse when a child is lying on his or her back. It is caused by excess tissue around the larynx and is typically harmless. It typically passes by the time a child reaches age 2. Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on).

11,38,"['Bipolar disorder was formerly called manic depression. It is a form of major affective disorder, or mood disorder, defined by manic or hypomanic episodes (changes from one\'s normal mood accompanied by high energy states). Bipolar disorder is a serious condition. Mania often involves sleeplessness, sometimes for days, along with hallucinations, psychosis, grandiose delusions, or paranoid rage. In addition, depressive episodes can be more devastating and harder to treat than in people who never have manias or hypomanias. Bipolar disorder is a complex disorder that likely stems from a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. The mood episodes associated with it involve clinical depression or mania (extreme elation and high energy) with periods of normal mood and energy in between episodes. The severity of mood episodes can range from very mild to extreme, and they can happen gradually or suddenly within a timeframe of days to weeks. When discrete mood episodes happen four or more times per year, the process is called rapid cycling. Rapid cycling should not be confused with very frequent moment-to-moment changes in mood, which can sometimes occur in people with bipolar disorder or other conditions such as borderline personality disorder. Along with manic or depressive episodes, patients with bipolar disorder may have disturbances in thinking. They may also have distortions of perception and impairment in social functioning. Like with other mood disorders, the causes of bipolar disorder are not known. What is known is that bipolar disorder involves dysregulation of brain functioning and sometimes has a genetic component (it can run in families). Bipolar disorder usually appears between ages 15 and 24 and persists through a lifetime. It\'s rare that newly diagnosed mania is seen in young children or in adults over age 65. Severity of symptoms varies with individuals who have bipolar disorder. While some people have a few symptoms, others have many that impair their ability to work and live a normal life. Marked by relapses and remissions, bipolar disorder has a high rate of recurrence if untreated. Patients with severe mania usually require hospitalization to keep them from risky behaviors. Those who are severely depressed also might need hospitalization to keep them from acting on suicidal thoughts or psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking). About 90% of individuals with bipolar I disorder, which is the more serious form, have at least one psychiatric hospitalization. Two out of three will have two or more hospitalizations in their lifetime. The clinical depression symptoms seen with bipolar disorder are the same as those seen in major depressive disorder and include: Decreased appetite and/or weight loss, or overeating and weight gain Difficulty concentrating, remembering, and making decisions Fatigue, decreased energy, being ""slowed down"" Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including sex Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain Persistently sad, anxious, or ""empty"" moods Restlessness, irritability Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts The signs of mania in bipolar disorder include: Disconnected and very fast (racing) thoughts Grandiose beliefs Inappropriate elation or euphoria Inappropriate irritability Inappropriate social behavior Increased sexual desire Increased talking speed or volume Markedly increased energy Poor judgment A decreased need for sleep due to high energy While mania is the main characteristic of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II has milder periods of elation known as hypomania. It also has episodes of major depression. According to the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, the difference between mania and hypomania is ""the degree of severity"" as well as an absence of psychosis (delusions or hallucinations) in hypomania and no negative impact from ""high"" symptoms in work and social functioning. Signs of hypomania in bipolar II disorder include: Decreased need for sleep Extreme focus on projects at work or at home Exuberant and elated mood Increased confidence Increased creativity and productivity Increased energy and libido Reckless behaviors Risky pleasure-seeking behaviors As with most mood disorders, there is no laboratory test or brain imaging method to diagnose bipolar disorder. After performing a physical exam, your doctor will evaluate your signs and symptoms. Your doctor will also ask you about your personal medical history and family history. Lab tests may be done to rule out other medical illnesses that can affect mood. In addition, your doctor may want to talk with family members to see if they can identify times when you were elated and over-energized. Because elation may feel good or even normal when compared to depression, it\'s often hard for a person with bipolar disorder to know if the mood was too high. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase. So early diagnosis and effective treatment is very important with bipolar disorder. Treatment for bipolar disorder may include the use of mood stabilizers such as lithium. Certain anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines may also be used to stabilize mood. Sometimes antidepressants are given in combination with mood stabilizers to boost the depressed mood, although antidepressants are often not as effective as some mood stabilizers or certain atypical antipsychotics for treating depression in bipolar disorder.']",['https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression'],"['https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression\nBipolar disorder was formerly called manic depression.

Those who are severely depressed also might need hospitalization to keep them from acting on suicidal thoughts or psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking). About 90% of individuals with bipolar I disorder, which is the more serious form, have at least one psychiatric hospitalization. Two out of three will have two or more hospitalizations in their lifetime. The clinical depression symptoms seen with bipolar disorder are the same as those seen in major depressive disorder and include: Decreased appetite and/or weight loss, or overeating and weight gain Difficulty concentrating, remembering, and making decisions Fatigue, decreased energy, being ""slowed down"" Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including sex Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain Persistently sad, anxious, or ""empty"" moods Restlessness, irritability Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts The signs of mania in bipolar disorder include: Disconnected and very fast (racing) thoughts Grandiose beliefs Inappropriate elation or euphoria Inappropriate irritability Inappropriate social behavior Increased sexual desire Increased talking speed or volume Markedly increased energy Poor judgment A decreased need for sleep due to high energy While mania is the main characteristic of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II has milder periods of elation known as hypomania. It also has episodes of major depression. According to the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, the difference between mania and hypomania is ""the degree of severity"" as well as an absence of psychosis (delusions or hallucinations) in hypomania and no negative impact from ""high"" symptoms in work and social functioning. Signs of hypomania in bipolar II disorder include: Decreased need for sleep Extreme focus on projects at work or at home Exuberant and elated mood Increased confidence Increased creativity and productivity Increased energy and libido Reckless behaviors Risky pleasure-seeking behaviors As with most mood disorders, there is no laboratory test or brain imaging method to diagnose bipolar disorder. After performing a physical exam, your doctor will evaluate your signs and symptoms. Your doctor will also ask you about your personal medical history and family history. Lab tests may be done to rule out other medical illnesses that can affect mood. In addition, your doctor may want to talk with family members to see if they can identify times when you were elated and over-energized. Because elation may feel good or even normal when compared to depression, it\'s often hard for a person with bipolar disorder to know if the mood was too high. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase. So early diagnosis and effective treatment is very important with bipolar disorder. Treatment for bipolar disorder may include the use of mood stabilizers such as lithium. Certain anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines may also be used to stabilize mood. Sometimes antidepressants are given in combination with mood stabilizers to boost the depressed mood, although antidepressants are often not as effective as some mood stabilizers or certain atypical antipsychotics for treating depression in bipolar disorder.']",['https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression'],"['https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression\nBipolar disorder was formerly called manic depression. It is a form of major affective disorder, or mood disorder, defined by manic or hypomanic episodes (changes from one\'s normal mood accompanied by high energy states). Bipolar disorder is a serious condition. Mania often involves sleeplessness, sometimes for days, along with hallucinations, psychosis, grandiose delusions, or paranoid rage. In addition, depressive episodes can be more devastating and harder to treat than in people who never have manias or hypomanias. Bipolar disorder is a complex disorder that likely stems from a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. The mood episodes associated with it involve clinical depression or mania (extreme elation and high energy) with periods of normal mood and energy in between episodes. The severity of mood episodes can range from very mild to extreme, and they can happen gradually or suddenly within a timeframe of days to weeks. When discrete mood episodes happen four or more times per year, the process is called rapid cycling. Rapid cycling should not be confused with very frequent moment-to-moment changes in mood, which can sometimes occur in people with bipolar disorder or other conditions such as borderline personality disorder. Along with manic or depressive episodes, patients with bipolar disorder may have disturbances in thinking. They may also have distortions of perception and impairment in social functioning. Like with other mood disorders, the causes of bipolar disorder are not known. What is known is that bipolar disorder involves dysregulation of brain functioning and sometimes has a genetic component (it can run in families). Bipolar disorder usually appears between ages 15 and 24 and persists through a lifetime. It\'s rare that newly diagnosed mania is seen in young children or in adults over age 65.

13,36,"[""Radiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you're struggling with fatigue. She might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you're feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated. Don't scrub or rub your skin. To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it. Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to. Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. Stay out of the sun as much as possible. Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it. Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors. If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra. If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire. Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. And you'll still need to protect yourself from the sun even after radiation therapy has ended. Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it's usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. But it's important to keep eating a healthy diet while you're having treatment to keep your body strong. Try eating five or six small meals spread out through the day instead of three large ones. Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. She can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. She'll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn't try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don't go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated.

The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you're struggling with fatigue. She might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you're feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. \x1b[92m[1] Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Don't scrub or rub your skin\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin\x1b[0m. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. \x1b[92m[6] Stay out of the sun as much as possible\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to\x1b[0m. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. And you'll still need to protect yourself from the sun even after radiation therapy has ended. Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it's usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. But it's important to keep eating a healthy diet while you're having treatment to keep your body strong. Try eating five or six small meals spread out through the day instead of three large ones. Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. She can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. She'll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn't try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don't go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated. Talk with your doctor about the potential risk and how it compares to the benefits you'll get from radiation therapy.""]",How can you take care of your skin from radiation therapy?,"To protect your skin during radiation therapy, handle it with care: Avoid tight-fitting garments over the treated region [92m[1][0m.

14,25,"['After an organ transplant, most patients quickly feel better. They go on to enjoy a significantly improved quality of life. But they are also likely to face big health challenges. Here are some tips for managing your health after an organ transplant. After an organ transplant, you will need to take immunosuppressant (anti-rejection) drugs. These drugs help prevent your immune system from attacking (""rejecting"") the donor organ. Typically, they must be taken for the lifetime of your transplanted organ. You will take other medications to help the anti-rejection drugs do their job or control their side effects. And you may need to take medications for other health conditions. Organ rejection is a constant threat. Keeping the immune system from attacking your transplanted organ requires constant vigilance. So, it\'s likely that your transplant team will make adjustments to your anti-rejection drug regimen. After your transplant, it\'s vital that you: Keep all your doctor appointments Undergo every recommended lab test Take all your prescription drugs It\'s also important to find a good pharmacist who can help you: Understand your medications Manage your medication schedule Understand how the medicine works Learn about side effects and interactions Although rejection is a scary word, it doesn\'t necessarily mean that you will lose your donor organ. Most of the time, a rejection can be reversed if your doctor detects its early signs. The symptoms of rejection -- and the medical tests used to detect rejection -- vary by the type of your organ transplant. So, it\'s important to familiarize yourself with the earlysymptoms of rejection that are specific to your transplant. If your doctor identifies a rejection, he or she will first try to reverse it by adjusting your medications. For example, you may need to: Switch to a new drug Add another drug Take a larger or smaller dose of your medications During the first few months after an organ transplant, your transplant team will see you frequently to assess the function of your donor organ. Your doctor will help you develop good health habits to keep your body as healthy as possible. The transplant team also will urge you to: Keep all wellness checkups Monitor your blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol Get all recommended health screenings on schedule After an organ transplant, you may experience short-term medication side effects such as: Hair growth or hair loss Acne Mood swings Round face Enlarged gums Weight gain These side effects may let up as your initial high dose of medication is tapered down. You also may experience other side effects such as: Diarrhea High blood pressure High cholesterol Elevated blood sugars Infection If you notice any side effects, don\'t stop taking the drugs on your own. First, let your doctor know. He or she can adjust your prescriptions to minimize side effects without increasing your risk of organ rejection. In addition to the tests that you undergo at regular follow-up visits, you will need to do some self-monitoring at home. Among the things you\'ll need to monitor are: Weight. Weigh yourself daily at the same time, preferably in the morning. Call your doctor if you gain 2 pounds in a day or more than 5 pounds total. Temperature. Take your temperature daily. Call your doctor if your temperature is too high. Blood pressure. Check your blood pressure as recommended by your doctor. Pulse. Check your pulse daily. Call your doctor if it\'s higher than the normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. ( If you\'ve had a heart transplant, your resting heart rate may be as high as 110 to 120 beats per minute.) Blood sugar. Monitor your blood sugar if you have high blood sugar or diabetes. Anti-rejection drugs can interact with many other medications or supplements. So check with your doctor or pharmacist about safe over-the-counter products you can take. Anti-rejection drugs increase your risk of dental problems. These include: Dry mouth Mouth ulcers Enlarged gums Tumors Thrush (a yeast infection) Brush and floss your teeth each day. Also look inside your mouth and under your tongue each day. Call your dentist if you notice any changes or problems. A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. But it\'s especially important after an organ transplant. Poor lifestyle habits can increase the risk of organ rejection. Be sure to avoid unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Embrace healthy behaviors such as: A nutritious diet Exercise Stress management Your transplant dietitian will give you tips for following a healthy diet. These may include: Eat high-fiber foods such as raw fruits and vegetables. Increase calcium by eating low-fat dairy products, eating green leafy vegetables, or taking calcium supplements (if directed by your doctor). Eat less salt, processed food, and snacks. Drink plenty of water (unless you are told to limit fluids). Eat high-protein foods such as lean meat, chicken (without the skin), fish, eggs, unsalted nuts, and beans. Instead of frying your food, try baking, broiling, grilling, boiling, or steaming. After an organ transplant, most patients are advised to start their exercise program with a low-impact activity such as walking. You can then gradually increase your workout intensity with aerobic activities such as: Bicycling Jogging Swimming Resistance exercise with weights can increase strength and help prevent bone loss. Stretching exercises can increase muscle tone and flexibility. The type and amount of exercise you can do after an organ transplant will depend on your age and overall physical condition. So, it\'s important to follow the recommendations of your transplant team. Transplant patients face a wide range of health concerns after the transplant.

The symptoms of rejection -- and the medical tests used to detect rejection -- vary by the type of your organ transplant. So, it\'s important to familiarize yourself with the earlysymptoms of rejection that are specific to your transplant. If your doctor identifies a rejection, he or she will first try to reverse it by adjusting your medications. For example, you may need to: Switch to a new drug Add another drug Take a larger or smaller dose of your medications During the first few months after an organ transplant, your transplant team will see you frequently to assess the function of your donor organ. Your doctor will help you develop good health habits to keep your body as healthy as possible. The transplant team also will urge you to: Keep all wellness checkups Monitor your blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol Get all recommended health screenings on schedule After an organ transplant, you may experience short-term medication side effects such as: Hair growth or hair loss Acne Mood swings Round face Enlarged gums Weight gain These side effects may let up as your initial high dose of medication is tapered down. You also may experience other side effects such as: Diarrhea High blood pressure High cholesterol Elevated blood sugars Infection If you notice any side effects, don\'t stop taking the drugs on your own. First, let your doctor know. He or she can adjust your prescriptions to minimize side effects without increasing your risk of organ rejection. In addition to the tests that you undergo at regular follow-up visits, you will need to do some self-monitoring at home. Among the things you\'ll need to monitor are: Weight. Weigh yourself daily at the same time, preferably in the morning. Call your doctor if you gain 2 pounds in a day or more than 5 pounds total. Temperature. Take your temperature daily. Call your doctor if your temperature is too high. Blood pressure. Check your blood pressure as recommended by your doctor. Pulse. Check your pulse daily. Call your doctor if it\'s higher than the normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. ( If you\'ve had a heart transplant, your resting heart rate may be as high as 110 to 120 beats per minute.) Blood sugar. Monitor your blood sugar if you have high blood sugar or diabetes. Anti-rejection drugs can interact with many other medications or supplements. So check with your doctor or pharmacist about safe over-the-counter products you can take. Anti-rejection drugs increase your risk of dental problems. These include: Dry mouth Mouth ulcers Enlarged gums Tumors Thrush (a yeast infection) Brush and floss your teeth each day. Also look inside your mouth and under your tongue each day. Call your dentist if you notice any changes or problems. A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. But it\'s especially important after an organ transplant. Poor lifestyle habits can increase the risk of organ rejection. Be sure to avoid unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Embrace healthy behaviors such as: \x1b[92m A nutritious diet\x1b[0m Exercise Stress management Your transplant dietitian will give you tips for following a healthy diet. These may include: \x1b[92m Eat high-fiber foods such as raw fruits and vegetables\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Increase calcium by eating low-fat dairy products, eating green leafy vegetables, or taking calcium supplements (if directed by your doctor)\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Eat less salt, processed food, and snacks\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Drink plenty of water (unless you are told to limit fluids)\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Eat high-protein foods such as lean meat, chicken (without the skin), fish, eggs, unsalted nuts, and beans\x1b[0m.

It\'s not uncommon for these health challenges to lead to stress. Getting proper rest and exercise can help.']","['After an organ transplant, most patients quickly feel better. They go on to enjoy a significantly improved quality of life. But they are also likely to face big health challenges. Here are some tips for managing your health after an organ transplant. After an organ transplant, you will need to take immunosuppressant (anti-rejection) drugs. These drugs help prevent your immune system from attacking (""rejecting"") the donor organ. Typically, they must be taken for the lifetime of your transplanted organ. You will take other medications to help the anti-rejection drugs do their job or control their side effects. And you may need to take medications for other health conditions. Organ rejection is a constant threat. Keeping the immune system from attacking your transplanted organ requires constant vigilance. So, it\'s likely that your transplant team will make adjustments to your anti-rejection drug regimen.

It helps make the outer membranes of our bodies\' cells stable. But for decades, doctors have known that people with high total cholesterol levels are more likely to get heart disease. More recently, they\'ve found the different forms of cholesterol (""good"" and ""bad"") also play a role. High total cholesterol, high bad cholesterol, or low good cholesterol could raise your chances. For example, LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol can stick to blood vessel walls. Over years, it can play a role in clogging arteries in a process called atherosclerosis. Narrowed arteries in your heart can then develop sudden blood clots, causing heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends that everyone over age 20 get a cholesterol test so you know what your levels are and can do something about them if you need to. The different kinds of cholesterol and other fats in your blood are together called lipids. Doctors measure and diagnose lipid problems with a simple blood test. You\'ll probably have to fast for 9 to 12 hours before it to make sure it\'s not affected by any food you recently ate. A lipid profile usually gives results for four different types: Total cholesterol LDL (low-density lipoprotein), the ""bad cholesterol"" HDL (high-density lipoprotein), the ""good cholesterol"" Triglycerides, another form of fat Some lipid panels can give even more detailed information, like the presence and sizes of various fat particles in your blood. Researchers are looking into what, if any, effect these traits have on heart disease. There\'s no clear guidelines on when this more advanced testing is needed. So you\'ve gone hungry overnight, endured a small bloodletting, and dutifully returned to get your results. Now, what do the numbers mean? For total cholesterol: 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) or less is normal. 201 to 240 mg/d L is borderline. More than 240 mg/d L is high. For HDL (""good cholesterol""), more is better: 60 mg/d L or higher is good -- it protects against heart disease. 40 to 59 mg/d L is OK. Less than 40 mg/d L is low, raising your chance of heart disease. For LDL (""bad cholesterol""), lower is better: Less than 100 mg/d L is ideal. 100 to 129 mg/d L can be good, depending on your health. 130 to 159 mg/d L is borderline high. 160 to 189 mg/d L is high. 190 mg/d L or more is very high. Your doctor will consider your overall likelihood of heart disease to set your personal LDL goal. For people at great risk of heart disease, or who already have it, your LDL should be less than 100 mg/d L. ( Your heart doctor might recommend an even lower LDL -- less than 70 mg/d L -- if your risk of heart disease is very high.) If you have a moderately high chance, an LDL less than 130 mg/d L is your target. If you\'re not likely to get heart disease, less than 160 mg/d L is probably fine. High triglycerides (150 mg/d L or greater) also raise the odds for heart disease somewhat. Lifestyle changes are the first thing to tackle to reduce your chance of heart disease. A cholesterol-lowering diet can bring down bad cholesterol by up to 30%. A diet low in saturated fat (7% of total calories or less) and no more than 200 mg of cholesterol daily can lower LDL cholesterol. Fiber and plant sterols (found in special margarines and other foods) help, too. Regular aerobic exercise can both lower bad cholesterol ( LDL) and raise good cholesterol ( HDL). If diet and exercise don\'t lower cholesterol levels enough, you can try medications or a combination of treatments including: Statins, the most effective and commonly used cholesterol drugs Niacin Fibrates Zetia Bile acid sequestrants Your cholesterol numbers don\'t determine your destiny. Remember, other things besides cholesterol can also lead to heart disease. Diabetes, smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, exercise, and genetics are important as well. People with normal cholesterol can have heart disease; people with high cholesterol can have healthy hearts. Overall, though, more people whose cholesterol levels are off will get heart disease. Experts recommend follow-up cholesterol testing every 5 years for most people. If your lipid results aren\'t what you and your doctor had hoped for, or if you have other reasons to be concerned about heart disease, you\'ll need cholesterol tests more often.']",['https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/guide/tests-for-high-cholesterol-lipid-panel'],"['https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/guide/tests-for-high-cholesterol-lipid-panel\nvar s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context[\'wb.modimp\'] = \'vidfloat\'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $(\'.responsive-video-container\').insert After(\'.module-social-share-container\'); require([\'video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader\'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $(\'article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)\').attr(\'chronic_id\'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: \'in-article\', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $(\'.responsive-video-container\').remove(); }); } Cholesterol is a form of fat we need.

16,24,"[""The initial treatment for a stress fracture is to elevate the extremity and rest while the bone heals itself. Ice the affected area for 24 to 48 hours and reduce your activity. For pain, you may use NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. Depending on which bone is involved, your doctor may recommend a splint or cast to immobilize the affected area. When the swelling has decreased to the point you can see skin creases, you can begin partially putting weight on the area. In some cases, crutches or a cane is necessary. Usually, you can begin full weight-bearing at two weeks after the symptoms started, but don't do anything that causes pain. Weight-bearing stimulates healing. For the next six to eight weeks -- or until you're free of pain -- avoid the activity that caused the stress fracture, and avoid putting too much weight on the affected area.

17,29,"[""Your doctor or pharmacist can help you get answers about emergency contraception. You may want to ask them: There are lots of good options. But the best one for you depends on different things. Your age, for instance -- some nonprescription products have age limits. Your insurance may pay only for a prescription. When you had sex can matter, too. Some products work for about 3 days after, some for 5. Your doctor or pharmacist can steer you in the right direction. The copper- T intrauterine device ( IUD) can work as emergency contraception. The IUD goes inside your body. If you want an IUD, a nurse or doctor needs to put it in within 5 days of when you had sex. The IUD works as both emergency contraception and as ongoing birth control. It prevents pregnancy as long as it is in place. The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception. . Ask your doctor if an IUD might be a good choice for you, especially if you already wanted long-term birth control. There are 3 types of emergency contraception in pill form that are sold both with and without a prescription. You need to be 17 to buy them if a prescription is needed. Depending on the brand and dose, you might get 1 pill or 2. 1. Pills containing a hormone called levonorgestrel: My Way (over-the-counter) Plan B One- Step (over-the-counter) Preventeza (over-the-counter) Take Action (over-the-counter) 2. Birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception, but you have to take more than one pill at a time to keep from getting pregnant. This approach works, but it is less effective and more likely to cause nausea than levonorgestrel. Birth control pills require a prescription. Talk to your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking the correct pills and dose. 3. A third kind of emergency contraception pill is called ulipristal (ella, ella One). You need a prescription to get it. Some meds and supplements -- such as the epilepsy drug Dilantin, antibiotics such as rifampicin or griseofulvin, and St. John's wort -- can stop emergency contraception pills from working normally. To be safe, tell your doctor or pharmacist about other drugs and supplements you take. Emergency birth-control pills and the IUD are safe for almost all women. But if you have medical problems and you're concerned that taking emergency contraception could be risky, talk to a doctor or pharmacist. The pills may not work as well for women who are overweight or obese. It may be awkward to discuss, but ask a pharmacist or doctor. If you're overweight, Ella may work better than Plan B One- Step and generic levonorgestrel. In general, the IUD seems to work better than pills for heavier women. You should use a regular form of birth control right away. Emergency contraception lasts only for about 24 hours and may just delay ovulation, not stop it. Make sure you're protected. Some types of emergency contraception may not be safe if you're already pregnant. Most pills won't harm your pregnancy. But you should not take Ella if you think you might be pregnant. It's not safe. Prices can vary. They depend on the type of pill, the store, and other things.

18,35,"[""Because you have diabetes, you probably check your blood sugar several times a day to stay within a healthy range. Once a day, check your feet, too. Why? Diabetes can cause poor blood flow to your feet, so small cuts or sores don't heal as well, and they can take longer to recover. If your blood sugar isn't well-controlled, you can also have poor or no feeling in your feet. You might not even realize you have a minor injury. Diabetes can also dry the skin on your feet and make your heels crack. The big risk is infection. Germs or fungus can get into small cuts or cracks. If you think you've gotten an infection, tell your doctor right away. Early treatment can prevent it from spreading. And that makes you more likely to avoid bigger problems. Some people with diabetes who get major infections even have to get surgery to remove part or all of an affected limb. So, check your feet carefully each day. Keep your skin clean and moisturized, avoid injuries, and protect your feet to prevent small cuts, corns, calluses, blisters, or injuries. Set a specific time each day to do this check. Use good light so you can spot any problems. If it's hard for you to lean over or see your foot, ask someone to help you. Look at your feet, toes, and heels for any cuts, sores, bruises, calluses, blisters, scrapes, scratches, or skin color changes. Check between your toes for cuts or fungus that might cause athlete's foot. Look at your toenails to spot any changes. Watch for dry, cracking skin on your feet, toes, and heels. Wear thick, soft socks to protect your feet as you walk. Don't use socks with seams that might rub against your skin and cause blisters. Wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes. Shoes that are too tight or too loose may lead to blisters. Don't go barefoot. You don't want to step on rocks, tacks, or small pieces of glass that could cut your feet. Wear slippers at home. Make sure the insides of your socks and shoes are clean and free from small pebbles or debris that could cut your feet. Keep your feet clean. Don't soak them for a long time. This can dry your skin. Dry your feet well after a shower or bath. Make sure you dry between your toes. After you bathe and towel your feet, moisturize your skin. Rub lotion or petroleum jelly into your skin and heels to keep them from drying and cracking. Don't put lotion or jelly between your toes, though -- this can lead to an infection. In winter, cold weather and central heating can dry out your skin. Take extra care to moisturize your feet and keep them warm. Wear socks to bed if you get cold. Don't let the corners of your toenails grow into the skin. This could cause an ingrown toenail. File your toenails with an emery board. You can also have a nail technician or your podiatrist trim and file them regularly. If you get pedicures at a nail salon, bring your own nail tools. Don't use anything sharp to clean under your toenails or to remove calluses. You don't want to accidentally get a cut that could let an infection set in. You can use a pumice stone to gently smooth your heels after taking a shower or bath. Don't rub too harshly. Exercise regularly to keep your blood flow healthy. Watch your blood sugar levels and follow your diet as your doctor directs. If you keep your blood sugar and weight under control, you may have fewer foot problems. Don't smoke. Smoking can narrow your blood vessels and raise your chance of getting foot problems. Also, note any cuts, scratches, scrapes, blisters, corns, or calluses, even if they're small. Let your doctor or podiatrist know in case you need medical treatment. Look for any redness, swelling, or drainage that could be a sign of an infection. If you think an infection is starting, get medical attention. Watch for foot sores called ulcers. They often develop on the balls of your feet or the bottoms of your toes. Tell your doctor if you think you have one. Nails that seem thicker, yellow, changed in shape, striped, or not growing normally could be a sign of an injury or infection. If your foot, ankle, or toe is swollen, red, hot to the touch, changed in shape or size, or hurts during normal movement, you may have a sprain or fracture. Call your doctor or seek medical treatment right away. Damage to your nerves, called diabetic neuropathy, can raise your chance of having a serious condition called Charcot foot, which causes a change in the shape of the foot. Call your doctor if you have minor foot problems like bunions, hammertoe, plantar warts, or athlete's foot, a fungal infection. Treat these issues before they become more serious. If you spot a wart, corn, or callus on your foot, don't try to treat it yourself with over-the-counter pads or liquids. Don't try to cut it off your skin. Ask your podiatrist or doctor to remove it safely.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/diabetes-better-foot-care'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/diabetes-better-foot-care\nBecause you have diabetes, you probably check your blood sugar several times a day to stay within a healthy range.

Dry your feet well after a shower or bath. Make sure you dry between your toes. After you bathe and towel your feet, moisturize your skin. Rub lotion or petroleum jelly into your skin and heels to keep them from drying and cracking. Don't put lotion or jelly between your toes, though -- this can lead to an infection. In winter, cold weather and central heating can dry out your skin. Take extra care to moisturize your feet and keep them warm. Wear socks to bed if you get cold. Don't let the corners of your toenails grow into the skin. This could cause an ingrown toenail. File your toenails with an emery board. You can also have a nail technician or your podiatrist trim and file them regularly. If you get pedicures at a nail salon, bring your own nail tools. Don't use anything sharp to clean under your toenails or to remove calluses. You don't want to accidentally get a cut that could let an infection set in.

Smoking can narrow your blood vessels and raise your chance of getting foot problems. Also, note any cuts, scratches, scrapes, blisters, corns, or calluses, even if they're small. Let your doctor or podiatrist know in case you need medical treatment. Look for any redness, swelling, or drainage that could be a sign of an infection. If you think an infection is starting, get medical attention. Watch for foot sores called ulcers. They often develop on the balls of your feet or the bottoms of your toes. Tell your doctor if you think you have one. Nails that seem thicker, yellow, changed in shape, striped, or not growing normally could be a sign of an injury or infection. If your foot, ankle, or toe is swollen, red, hot to the touch, changed in shape or size, or hurts during normal movement, you may have a sprain or fracture. Call your doctor or seek medical treatment right away. Damage to your nerves, called diabetic neuropathy, can raise your chance of having a serious condition called Charcot foot, which causes a change in the shape of the foot.

Once a day, check your feet, too. Why? Diabetes can cause poor blood flow to your feet, so small cuts or sores don't heal as well, and they can take longer to recover. If your blood sugar isn't well-controlled, you can also have poor or no feeling in your feet. You might not even realize you have a minor injury. Diabetes can also dry the skin on your feet and make your heels crack. The big risk is infection. Germs or fungus can get into small cuts or cracks. If you think you've gotten an infection, tell your doctor right away. Early treatment can prevent it from spreading. And that makes you more likely to avoid bigger problems. Some people with diabetes who get major infections even have to get surgery to remove part or all of an affected limb.

19,29,"[""Your doctor or pharmacist can help you get answers about emergency contraception. You may want to ask them: There are lots of good options. But the best one for you depends on different things. Your age, for instance -- some nonprescription products have age limits. Your insurance may pay only for a prescription. When you had sex can matter, too. Some products work for about 3 days after, some for 5. Your doctor or pharmacist can steer you in the right direction. The copper- T intrauterine device ( IUD) can work as emergency contraception. The IUD goes inside your body. If you want an IUD, a nurse or doctor needs to put it in within 5 days of when you had sex. The IUD works as both emergency contraception and as ongoing birth control. It prevents pregnancy as long as it is in place. The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception. . Ask your doctor if an IUD might be a good choice for you, especially if you already wanted long-term birth control. There are 3 types of emergency contraception in pill form that are sold both with and without a prescription. You need to be 17 to buy them if a prescription is needed. Depending on the brand and dose, you might get 1 pill or 2. 1. Pills containing a hormone called levonorgestrel: My Way (over-the-counter) Plan B One- Step (over-the-counter) Preventeza (over-the-counter) Take Action (over-the-counter) 2. Birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception, but you have to take more than one pill at a time to keep from getting pregnant. This approach works, but it is less effective and more likely to cause nausea than levonorgestrel. Birth control pills require a prescription. Talk to your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking the correct pills and dose. 3. A third kind of emergency contraception pill is called ulipristal (ella, ella One). You need a prescription to get it. Some meds and supplements -- such as the epilepsy drug Dilantin, antibiotics such as rifampicin or griseofulvin, and St. John's wort -- can stop emergency contraception pills from working normally. To be safe, tell your doctor or pharmacist about other drugs and supplements you take. Emergency birth-control pills and the IUD are safe for almost all women. But if you have medical problems and you're concerned that taking emergency contraception could be risky, talk to a doctor or pharmacist. The pills may not work as well for women who are overweight or obese. It may be awkward to discuss, but ask a pharmacist or doctor. If you're overweight, Ella may work better than Plan B One- Step and generic levonorgestrel. In general, the IUD seems to work better than pills for heavier women. You should use a regular form of birth control right away. Emergency contraception lasts only for about 24 hours and may just delay ovulation, not stop it. Make sure you're protected. Some types of emergency contraception may not be safe if you're already pregnant. Most pills won't harm your pregnancy. But you should not take Ella if you think you might be pregnant. It's not safe. Prices can vary. They depend on the type of pill, the store, and other things.

20,29,"[""Your doctor or pharmacist can help you get answers about emergency contraception. You may want to ask them: There are lots of good options. But the best one for you depends on different things. Your age, for instance -- some nonprescription products have age limits. Your insurance may pay only for a prescription. When you had sex can matter, too. Some products work for about 3 days after, some for 5. Your doctor or pharmacist can steer you in the right direction. The copper- T intrauterine device ( IUD) can work as emergency contraception. The IUD goes inside your body. If you want an IUD, a nurse or doctor needs to put it in within 5 days of when you had sex. The IUD works as both emergency contraception and as ongoing birth control. It prevents pregnancy as long as it is in place. The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception. . Ask your doctor if an IUD might be a good choice for you, especially if you already wanted long-term birth control. There are 3 types of emergency contraception in pill form that are sold both with and without a prescription. You need to be 17 to buy them if a prescription is needed. Depending on the brand and dose, you might get 1 pill or 2. 1. Pills containing a hormone called levonorgestrel: My Way (over-the-counter) Plan B One- Step (over-the-counter) Preventeza (over-the-counter) Take Action (over-the-counter) 2. Birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception, but you have to take more than one pill at a time to keep from getting pregnant. This approach works, but it is less effective and more likely to cause nausea than levonorgestrel. Birth control pills require a prescription. Talk to your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking the correct pills and dose. 3. A third kind of emergency contraception pill is called ulipristal (ella, ella One). You need a prescription to get it. Some meds and supplements -- such as the epilepsy drug Dilantin, antibiotics such as rifampicin or griseofulvin, and St. John's wort -- can stop emergency contraception pills from working normally. To be safe, tell your doctor or pharmacist about other drugs and supplements you take. Emergency birth-control pills and the IUD are safe for almost all women. But if you have medical problems and you're concerned that taking emergency contraception could be risky, talk to a doctor or pharmacist. The pills may not work as well for women who are overweight or obese. It may be awkward to discuss, but ask a pharmacist or doctor. If you're overweight, Ella may work better than Plan B One- Step and generic levonorgestrel. In general, the IUD seems to work better than pills for heavier women. You should use a regular form of birth control right away. Emergency contraception lasts only for about 24 hours and may just delay ovulation, not stop it. Make sure you're protected. Some types of emergency contraception may not be safe if you're already pregnant. Most pills won't harm your pregnancy. But you should not take Ella if you think you might be pregnant. It's not safe. Prices can vary. They depend on the type of pill, the store, and other things.

21,33,"['When your doctor tells you that you have prediabetes, you might think there\'s no reason to take action just yet. Or you might assume that you\'re definitely going to get diabetes. Not so! You do need to take prediabetes seriously, but there\'s still time to turn things around -- if you start now. The goal is to get your blood sugar level out of the prediabetes range, and keep it that way. What you do every day makes a big difference. Making lifestyle changes may be even more powerful than just taking medication. That\'s what happened in a large study called the Diabetes Prevention Program: People with prediabetes who lost a small amount of weight through diet and exercise cut their odds of getting type 2 diabetes by 58%, compared to 31% for people who only took the prescription drug metformin. Start by making these three changes. If you\'re overweight, slimming down is the key to turning the odds in your favor. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. To reach your goal, limit portion sizes; cut calories; and eat fewer foods that are high in fat (especially saturated fat), sugar, and carbohydrates. You should also eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Leading an active life is a must. Aim for 30 minutes of aerobic activity (something that raises your heart rate, like walking, biking, or swimming) 5 days a week (150 minutes per week). Plus, do some strength-training exercise, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, at least twice a week. Strength work builds muscle, which helps lower your blood sugar level, helps your body respond better to insulin (which controls blood sugar), and burns calories even when you\'re not moving. Smoking is strongly linked to diabetes: People who smoke are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who don\'t. And people with diabetes who continue smoking are more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and blindness. So the sooner you ditch the cigarettes, the better. While lifestyle changes can work wonders, some people with prediabetes also need medication. Your doctor may prescribe metformin if you have certain risk factors, such as low levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol, high triglycerides (a type of blood fat), a parent or sibling with diabetes, or are overweight. If you take metformin, you\'ll need to follow up with your doctor. You\'ll also need to keep up a healthy lifestyle.

22,23,"['Many foods fall in and out of favor as health trends come and go. Not oatmeal. This whole-grain powerhouse has been packing serious nutrition and hearty flavor into breakfast for generations. It\'s one of the few comfort foods that are as good for you as they are just plain good. To get the most out of this super food, be a bit particular. Some packets of instant oatmeal, for example, are loaded with sugar -- as much as 8 teaspoons per serving -- and high in sodium. Always check the label to see what you\'re getting. Great oatmeal starts with plain rolled oats, or steel-cut oats, cooked in a little water or milk, and topped with wholesome ingredients. It\'s a feel-good start to the day, and if you make it a habit, it can do your health some favors. If you\'re on a gluten-free diet, look for oats that are certified gluten-free. Though oats themselves don\'t contain gluten, they can get tainted with gluten when they\'re being processed or growing, according to the Whole Grains Council. Oatmeal\'s most enduring claim to fame is its proven ability to curb bad ( LDL) cholesterol. Chalk that up to a type of soluble fiber called beta glucan. Eating oats is linked to an average 7% drop in LDL cholesterol, research shows. Many other things also affect your heart\'s health (like what else you eat, how active you are, and whether you smoke), but oatmeal is a simple heart-smart start. The fiber in oatmeal also helps you feel full and eat less later on during the day. Fiber also eases constipation and helps control blood sugars. When you shop for oats, you\'ll see several types on the store shelves. They\'re all based on ""oat groats,"" which are the whole oat kernel. Instant oats: Oat groats that have been steamed and flaked.

23,38,"['Bipolar disorder was formerly called manic depression. It is a form of major affective disorder, or mood disorder, defined by manic or hypomanic episodes (changes from one\'s normal mood accompanied by high energy states). Bipolar disorder is a serious condition. Mania often involves sleeplessness, sometimes for days, along with hallucinations, psychosis, grandiose delusions, or paranoid rage. In addition, depressive episodes can be more devastating and harder to treat than in people who never have manias or hypomanias. Bipolar disorder is a complex disorder that likely stems from a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. The mood episodes associated with it involve clinical depression or mania (extreme elation and high energy) with periods of normal mood and energy in between episodes. The severity of mood episodes can range from very mild to extreme, and they can happen gradually or suddenly within a timeframe of days to weeks. When discrete mood episodes happen four or more times per year, the process is called rapid cycling. Rapid cycling should not be confused with very frequent moment-to-moment changes in mood, which can sometimes occur in people with bipolar disorder or other conditions such as borderline personality disorder. Along with manic or depressive episodes, patients with bipolar disorder may have disturbances in thinking. They may also have distortions of perception and impairment in social functioning. Like with other mood disorders, the causes of bipolar disorder are not known. What is known is that bipolar disorder involves dysregulation of brain functioning and sometimes has a genetic component (it can run in families). Bipolar disorder usually appears between ages 15 and 24 and persists through a lifetime. It\'s rare that newly diagnosed mania is seen in young children or in adults over age 65. Severity of symptoms varies with individuals who have bipolar disorder. While some people have a few symptoms, others have many that impair their ability to work and live a normal life. Marked by relapses and remissions, bipolar disorder has a high rate of recurrence if untreated. Patients with severe mania usually require hospitalization to keep them from risky behaviors. Those who are severely depressed also might need hospitalization to keep them from acting on suicidal thoughts or psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking). About 90% of individuals with bipolar I disorder, which is the more serious form, have at least one psychiatric hospitalization. Two out of three will have two or more hospitalizations in their lifetime. The clinical depression symptoms seen with bipolar disorder are the same as those seen in major depressive disorder and include: Decreased appetite and/or weight loss, or overeating and weight gain Difficulty concentrating, remembering, and making decisions Fatigue, decreased energy, being ""slowed down"" Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including sex Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain Persistently sad, anxious, or ""empty"" moods Restlessness, irritability Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts The signs of mania in bipolar disorder include: Disconnected and very fast (racing) thoughts Grandiose beliefs Inappropriate elation or euphoria Inappropriate irritability Inappropriate social behavior Increased sexual desire Increased talking speed or volume Markedly increased energy Poor judgment A decreased need for sleep due to high energy While mania is the main characteristic of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II has milder periods of elation known as hypomania. It also has episodes of major depression. According to the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, the difference between mania and hypomania is ""the degree of severity"" as well as an absence of psychosis (delusions or hallucinations) in hypomania and no negative impact from ""high"" symptoms in work and social functioning. Signs of hypomania in bipolar II disorder include: Decreased need for sleep Extreme focus on projects at work or at home Exuberant and elated mood Increased confidence Increased creativity and productivity Increased energy and libido Reckless behaviors Risky pleasure-seeking behaviors As with most mood disorders, there is no laboratory test or brain imaging method to diagnose bipolar disorder. After performing a physical exam, your doctor will evaluate your signs and symptoms. Your doctor will also ask you about your personal medical history and family history. Lab tests may be done to rule out other medical illnesses that can affect mood. In addition, your doctor may want to talk with family members to see if they can identify times when you were elated and over-energized. Because elation may feel good or even normal when compared to depression, it\'s often hard for a person with bipolar disorder to know if the mood was too high. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase. So early diagnosis and effective treatment is very important with bipolar disorder. Treatment for bipolar disorder may include the use of mood stabilizers such as lithium. Certain anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines may also be used to stabilize mood. Sometimes antidepressants are given in combination with mood stabilizers to boost the depressed mood, although antidepressants are often not as effective as some mood stabilizers or certain atypical antipsychotics for treating depression in bipolar disorder.']",['https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression'],"['https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression\nBipolar disorder was formerly called manic depression.

25,24,"[""The initial treatment for a stress fracture is to elevate the extremity and rest while the bone heals itself. Ice the affected area for 24 to 48 hours and reduce your activity. For pain, you may use NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. Depending on which bone is involved, your doctor may recommend a splint or cast to immobilize the affected area. When the swelling has decreased to the point you can see skin creases, you can begin partially putting weight on the area. In some cases, crutches or a cane is necessary. Usually, you can begin full weight-bearing at two weeks after the symptoms started, but don't do anything that causes pain. Weight-bearing stimulates healing. For the next six to eight weeks -- or until you're free of pain -- avoid the activity that caused the stress fracture, and avoid putting too much weight on the affected area. If you exercise again too soon, you could delay the healing process. You could even cause damage that may never heal properly. When you are ready to return to the activity, do it slowly.

26,22,"[""They may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite. In fact, dogs bite about 4.7 million Americans every year, half of them children between ages 5 and 9. One out of every five of those bites causes an injury that requires medical attention, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Children are also more likely than adults to be injured by a dog bite. Although strays or other strange dogs can bite, most of the time people are actually bitten by a dog they know, which could be a friend's dog or even the family pet. To prevent dog bites: When choosing a dog for a family pet, pick one with a good temperament. Stay away from any dogs you don't know. Never leave young children alone with a dog -- especially an unfamiliar one. Don't try to play with any dog that is eating or feeding her puppies. Whenever you approach a dog, do so slowly,and give the dog the chance to approach you. If a dog becomes aggressive, do not run away or scream. Stay calm, move slowly, and don't make eye contact with the dog. Although you can provide first aid for a dog bite at home, it's very important to see a doctor, especially if an unfamiliar dog bit you, the bite is deep, you can't stop the bleeding, or there are any signs of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus). Dog bites can cause infections that need to be treated with antibiotics. To care for a dog bite injury at home: Place a clean towel over the injury to stop any bleeding. Try to keep the injured area elevated. Wash the bite carefully with soap and water. Apply a sterile bandage to the wound. Apply antibiotic ointment to the injury every day to prevent infection. When you visit the doctor, be prepared to answer a few questions, including: Do you know the owner of the dog? If so, is the dog up to date on all vaccinations, including rabies? Did the bite occur because the dog was provoked, or was the dog unprovoked? What health conditions do you have? People with diabetes, liver disease, illnesses that suppress the immune system, and other health conditions may be at greater risk for a more severe infection. Your doctor will examine the injury to see whether the bite was deep enough to damage muscles, tendons, nerves, or bones. Then the doctor will thoroughly clean the bite wound to remove any dirt or bacteria, and may also remove dead tissues from the wound. Sometimes, sutures are used to close a dog bite wound; however, this practice is controversial. Although suturing the injury can reduce scarring, it also can increase the risk of infection. Whether the injury is closed may depend on its location. For example, dog bites on the face may be sutured to prevent visible scars. Very deep wounds that cause a great deal of damage may require plastic surgery. Your doctor will also take measures to prevent infection. It's rare for dogs in the U. S. to have rabies, but if the dog's health status is unknown, or the dog tests positive for rabies, you will need to get a rabies vaccine. ( Bear in mind that the dog would have to be euthanized and their brain tested for rabies.) The doctor will also make sure that you are up to date on your tetanus shot. You may need to take antibiotics for seven to 14 days to prevent or treat an infection. The doctor may ask you to come back in one to three days to have the injury rechecked. If you did not know the dog that bit you, make sure to report the bite to your local animal control office or police.""]",['https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites'],"[""https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites\nThey may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite.

Although scientists are still not completely sure why we have earwax, it does trap dust and other small particles and prevent them from reaching, and potentially damaging or infecting the eardrum. Normally, the wax dries up and falls out of the ear, along with any trapped dust or debris. Everyone makes ear wax, but the amount and type are genetically determined just like hair color or height. Smaller or oddly shaped ear canals may make it difficult for the naturally occurring wax to get out of the canal and lead to wax impactions. Blockage, or impaction, also occurs when the wax gets pushed deep within the ear canal. Earwax blockage is one of the most common ear problems doctors see. The most common cause of impactions is the use of Q-tips (and other objects such as bobby pins and rolled napkin corners), which can remove superficial wax but also pushes the rest of the wax deeper into the ear canal. Hearing aid and earplug users are also more prone to earwax blockage. Symptoms of an earwax impaction include: Decreased hearing Dizziness Ear pain Plugged or fullness sensation Ringing in the ear Itching or drainage from the ear canal See your doctor if you think you may have any symptoms of an earwax impaction. Other conditions may cause these symptoms and it is important to be sure earwax is the culprit before trying any home remedies. Go to the hospital if: You have a severe spinning sensation, loss of balance, or inability to walk You have persistent vomiting or high fever You experience sudden loss of hearing A doctor can diagnose earwax blockage (or eardrum perforation) by listening to your symptoms and then looking into your ear with an otoscope (ear-scope). Your doctor may recommend that you try an earwax removal method at home, unless you have a perforation (hole) or a tube in your eardrum. Over-the-counter wax softening drops such as Debrox or Murine may be put into the affected ear and then allowed to drain out after about five minutes while holding the head to the side, allowing the drops to settle. Sitting up again will let the drops drain out by themselves. A bulb-type syringe may be used to gently flush the ear with warm water. The water should be at body temperature to help prevent dizziness. Ear candling is not recommended. The procedure uses a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth on the tapered end. The tapered end is placed inside the ear, and an assistant lights the other end, while making sure your hair does not catch on fire. In theory, as the flame burns, a vacuum is created, which draws the wax out of the ear. Limited clinical trials, however, showed that no vacuum was created, and no wax was removed.

Although scientists are still not completely sure why we have earwax, it does trap dust and other small particles and prevent them from reaching, and potentially damaging or infecting the eardrum. Normally, the wax dries up and falls out of the ear, along with any trapped dust or debris. Everyone makes ear wax, but the amount and type are genetically determined just like hair color or height. Smaller or oddly shaped ear canals may make it difficult for the naturally occurring wax to get out of the canal and lead to wax impactions. Blockage, or impaction, also occurs when the wax gets pushed deep within the ear canal. Earwax blockage is one of the most common ear problems doctors see. The most common cause of impactions is the use of Q-tips (and other objects such as bobby pins and rolled napkin corners), which can remove superficial wax but also pushes the rest of the wax deeper into the ear canal. Hearing aid and earplug users are also more prone to earwax blockage. Symptoms of an earwax impaction include: Decreased hearing Dizziness Ear pain Plugged or fullness sensation Ringing in the ear Itching or drainage from the ear canal See your doctor if you think you may have any symptoms of an earwax impaction. Other conditions may cause these symptoms and it is important to be sure earwax is the culprit before trying any home remedies. Go to the hospital if: You have a severe spinning sensation, loss of balance, or inability to walk You have persistent vomiting or high fever You experience sudden loss of hearing A doctor can diagnose earwax blockage (or eardrum perforation) by listening to your symptoms and then looking into your ear with an otoscope (ear-scope). Your doctor may recommend that you try an earwax removal method at home, unless you have a perforation (hole) or a tube in your eardrum. Over-the-counter wax softening drops such as Debrox or Murine may be put into the affected ear and then allowed to drain out after about five minutes while holding the head to the side, allowing the drops to settle. Sitting up again will let the drops drain out by themselves. A bulb-type syringe may be used to gently flush the ear with warm water. The water should be at body temperature to help prevent dizziness. Ear candling is not recommended. The procedure uses a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth on the tapered end. The tapered end is placed inside the ear, and an assistant lights the other end, while making sure your hair does not catch on fire. In theory, as the flame burns, a vacuum is created, which draws the wax out of the ear. Limited clinical trials, however, showed that no vacuum was created, and no wax was removed.

29,27,"[""A positron emission tomography ( PET) scan may be used to locate the part of the brain that is causing seizures. A PET scan is a test used to give doctors and their patients more information about how the cells in the body are functioning. A PET scan is done by injecting a small amount of radioactive material (known as a tracer) into a patient's vein, usually in the arm. The tracer sends out small, positively charged particles (positrons) that interact with negatively charged particles (electrons) in your body. The PET scanner is able to detect the product of this interaction and uses it to make an image. The PET scan shows the brain's use of oxygen or sugar (glucose). For patients with epilepsy, a PET scan is used to localize the part of the brain that is causing the seizure activity. However, doctors may request a PET scan for many different reasons. Aside from potential problems in the brain and spinal cord, the test can also be used to diagnose heart problems as well as certain kinds of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, colon, and prostate cancers and lymphoma. Before undergoing the PET procedure, be sure to tell your doctor of any medication -- prescription or non-prescription -- that you are taking, along with any herbal drugs or supplements you may be using. It is also very important that you tell the doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, since the PET scan can be harmful to an unborn child. As the test is about to begin, you will be asked to take off clothing that is covering the area of the body to be tested. Depending on the area of your body being tested, you may be asked to undress completely and put on a hospital gown. You will also be asked to remove any dentures, jewelry, or metal objects during the scan, because these items may affect the reading. A PET scan usually lasts 45-60 minutes. You will be asked to lie down on a flat table that is next to a scanner computer and a camera. You will then be given the tracer through an IV. After that, the PET scanner, a doughnut-shaped instrument, will move in circles around you. As this is happening, the camera will take pictures of patterns left by the tracer chemical inside your body. After the PET scan is finished, you will likely be asked to drink a lot of water or liquids during the next day in order to get rid of or flush the tracer chemical from your system. Because radiation is part of the test, there is a very small risk that cells or tissue may have received some damage following the PET procedure. However, the radiation levels from the tracer that is sent throughout the body are very low. In addition, following the scan, patients may find that their arm is a little bit sore or that they experience redness where the IV was placed in the arm. PET scans are usually more extensive and detailed than similar tests that are available. Despite this, test results can usually be given to the patient a day or two after the scan.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/pet-scan-epilepsy'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/pet-scan-epilepsy\nA positron emission tomography ( PET) scan may be used to locate the part of the brain that is causing seizures.

For patients with epilepsy, a PET scan is used to localize the part of the brain that is causing the seizure activity. However, doctors may request a PET scan for many different reasons. Aside from potential problems in the brain and spinal cord, the test can also be used to diagnose heart problems as well as certain kinds of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, colon, and prostate cancers and lymphoma. Before undergoing the PET procedure, \x1b[92m[1] be sure to tell your doctor of any medication -- prescription or non-prescription -- that you are taking, along with any herbal drugs or supplements you may be using\x1b[0m.

A PET scan usually lasts 45-60 minutes. You will be asked to lie down on a flat table that is next to a scanner computer and a camera. You will then be given the tracer through an IV. After that, the PET scanner, a doughnut-shaped instrument, will move in circles around you. As this is happening, the camera will take pictures of patterns left by the tracer chemical inside your body. After the PET scan is finished, \x1b[92m[6] you will likely be asked to drink a lot of water or liquids during the next day in order to get rid of or flush the tracer chemical from your system\x1b[0m. Because radiation is part of the test, there is a very small risk that cells or tissue may have received some damage following the PET procedure. However, the radiation levels from the tracer that is sent throughout the body are very low. In addition, following the scan, patients may find that their arm is a little bit sore or that they experience redness where the IV was placed in the arm. PET scans are usually more extensive and detailed than similar tests that are available.

30,31,"['Photophobia literally means ""fear of light."" If you have photophobia, you\'re not actually afraid of light, but you are very sensitive to it. The sun or bright indoor light can be uncomfortable, even painful. Photophobia isn\'t a condition -- it\'s a symptom of another problem. Migraine headaches, dry eyes, and swelling inside your eye are commonly linked to light sensitivity. It can cause pain whenever you\'re in bright sunlight or indoor light. You might want to blink or close your eyes. Some people also get headaches. Photophobia is linked to the connection between cells in your eyes that detect light and a nerve that goes to your head. Migraines are the most common cause of light sensitivity. Up to 80% of people who get them have photophobia along with their headaches. Many of those people are light sensitive even when they don\'t have a headache. Other types of headaches can cause photophobia, too. People who get tension and cluster headaches also say they\'re uncomfortable around bright light. A few brain conditions can cause photophobia, including: Meningitis (swelling of the protective coverings of your brain and spinal cord) Serious brain injury Supranuclear palsy (a brain disorder that causes problems with balance, walking, and eye movement) Tumors in your pituitary gland Some eye diseases cause this symptom, including: Dry eye Uveitis (swelling of the inside of your eye) Keratitis (swelling of your cornea, the clear layer that covers the colored part of your eye) Iritis (swelling of the colored ring around your pupil) Cataracts (cloudy coverings over the lenses of your eyes) Corneal abrasion (a scratch on your cornea) Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear tissue that sits over the white part of your eye) Damage to your retina, the light-sensitive layer in the back of your eye Blepharospasm (a condition that makes your eyelids close uncontrollably) Photophobia may also affect some people who have these mental health conditions: Agoraphobia (a fear of being in public places) Anxiety Bipolar disorder Depression Panic disorder You can also get photophobia after you have LASIK or other surgery to fix vision problems. Certain wavelengths of light -- like the blue light your computer and smartphone give off -- cause the most sensitivity. Some medicines can also cause photophobia, including: Antibiotics, such as doxycycline and tetracycline. Furosemide ( Lasix): This keeps your body from holding on to too much fluid. It\'s used to treat congestive heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, and other conditions. Quinine ( Qualaquin): This is a drug used to treat malaria. If you think you have photophobia, see your eye doctor. She\'ll ask about your symptoms and any medical conditions you have. Then she\'ll check the health of your eyes and possibly your brain. Tests your doctor might use include: Slit-lamp eye exam. She\'ll use a special microscope with a light to examine your eyes. MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of your eyes. Exam of the tear film. This checks the amount of tears you make to see if you have dry eyes. The best way to ease photophobia is to treat the condition or stop taking the medicine that\'s causing it. If you\'re still affected by it, tinted glasses may help. Some people have found relief from rose-colored lenses called FL-41. But tinted lenses aren\'t for everyone. They can make some people even more sensitive to light, so talk with your doctor about what\'s best for you.']",['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/photophobia-facts'],"['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/photophobia-facts\nPhotophobia literally means ""fear of light.""

31,20,"['An insulinoma is a rare tumor of the pancreas. It\'s made of calls called beta islet cells, the same ones in the pancreas the make insulin and control your blood sugar. Normally, your pancreas makes more insulin when your blood sugar is high and less when your blood sugar is low. But an insulinoma constantly makes insulin, even when your blood sugar gets too low. You might hear an insulinoma called a ""neuroendocrine tumor"" because it starts in special cells in your body called neuroendocrine cells. These tumors are usually small (less than an inch), and almost all of them are not cancer. In most cases, surgery can cure them. Because insulomas make too much insulin, they can cause symptoms of low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia. You might have: Confusion Sweating Weakness Anxiety A fast heartbeat Headache Vision changes Personality changes Irritability Lack of muscle coordination Blurred vision Lethargy Seizure Hypoglycemia can be dangerous. If your blood sugar drops very low, you could faint or go into a coma. Hypoglycemia is common in people with diabetes. It often happens because they took too much of their medicine, missed a meal, or got more exercise than usual, all of which can lower blood sugar. An insulinoma can also cause hypoglycemia when you haven\'t eaten in a while, but it can happen at any time. It\'s not clear why some people get insulinomas. Women are slightly more likely to have them than men, and most people get them between ages 40 and 60. You\'re also more likely to have an insulinoma if you have certain genetic diseases, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: When tumors grow in glands that make hormones Von Hippel- Lindau syndrome: When tumors and cysts grow in many organs throughout the body Neurofibromatosis type 1 : Noncancerous tumors in the nerves and skin Tuberous sclerosis : Noncancerous tumors that grow in organs like your brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, and lungs It can be tough for doctors to diagnose an insulinoma. Its symptoms are the same as other common health problems. It may take time before your doctor can find it. You\'ll get tests like: Blood tests and suppression test. To find out if you have an insulinoma, your doctor will test your blood sugar, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during a 72-hour rest. This will confirm that: You have symptoms of low blood sugar, especially after not eating or heavy exercise Your blood sugar is actually low when you have those symptoms Your symptoms go away after your blood sugar goes up To do that, they will watch what happens to your blood sugar after you fast for a day to two. You may need to stay in the hospital during this time, and you won\'t be able to eat or drink anything except water. The doctor will test your blood to see if you have both low blood sugar and a high insulin level. Imaging test. You may also get an imaging test such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI so your doctor can see where the tumor is. The main treatment for an insulinoma is surgery to remove the tumor. Most of the time, that will cure you. The type of surgery you get depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Surgeons can usually remove just the insulinoma from the surface of the pancreas. Other times, the surgeon may need to remove part of the pancreas connected to the tumor. But this is less common. You might be able to have laparoscopic surgery to remove an insulinoma. In this operation, doctors make several smaller cuts in your body instead of one large one. They use special instruments to do the surgery. That means you\'ll have less pain as you heal, stay fewer days in the hospital, and can return to normal life more quickly. Most people won\'t need any more treatment after surgery. If your doctor thinks surgery won\'t work for you, you can try other treatments to manage low blood sugar. You might take medicine and eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. Cancerous insulinomas are rare, and they need different treatment. If your doctor can\'t remove the whole tumor, you may need to take medicine to prevent low blood sugar. You may also need chemotherapy. Depending on the type of tumor you have, another treatment option is getting a radioactive medicine called lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( Lutathera). You get this medicine through an IV.

Normally, your pancreas makes more insulin when your blood sugar is high and less when your blood sugar is low. But an insulinoma constantly makes insulin, even when your blood sugar gets too low. You might hear an insulinoma called a ""neuroendocrine tumor"" because it starts in special cells in your body called neuroendocrine cells. These tumors are usually small (less than an inch), and almost all of them are not cancer. In most cases, surgery can cure them. Because insulomas make too much insulin, they can cause symptoms of low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia. You might have: Confusion Sweating Weakness Anxiety A fast heartbeat Headache Vision changes Personality changes Irritability Lack of muscle coordination Blurred vision Lethargy Seizure Hypoglycemia can be dangerous. If your blood sugar drops very low, you could faint or go into a coma. Hypoglycemia is common in people with diabetes. It often happens because they took too much of their medicine, missed a meal, or got more exercise than usual, all of which can lower blood sugar. An insulinoma can also cause hypoglycemia when you haven\'t eaten in a while, but it can happen at any time. It\'s not clear why some people get insulinomas. Women are slightly more likely to have them than men, and most people get them between ages 40 and 60. You\'re also more likely to have an insulinoma if you have certain genetic diseases, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: When tumors grow in glands that make hormones Von Hippel- Lindau syndrome: When tumors and cysts grow in many organs throughout the body Neurofibromatosis type 1 : Noncancerous tumors in the nerves and skin Tuberous sclerosis : Noncancerous tumors that grow in organs like your brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, and lungs It can be tough for doctors to diagnose an insulinoma. Its symptoms are the same as other common health problems. It may take time before your doctor can find it. You\'ll get tests like: Blood tests and suppression test. To find out if you have an insulinoma, your doctor will test your blood sugar, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during a 72-hour rest. This will confirm that: You have symptoms of low blood sugar, especially after not eating or heavy exercise Your blood sugar is actually low when you have those symptoms Your symptoms go away after your blood sugar goes up To do that, they will watch what happens to your blood sugar after you fast for a day to two. You may need to stay in the hospital during this time, and you won\'t be able to eat or drink anything except water. The doctor will test your blood to see if you have both low blood sugar and a high insulin level. Imaging test. You may also get an imaging test such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI so your doctor can see where the tumor is. The main treatment for an insulinoma is surgery to remove the tumor. Most of the time, that will cure you. The type of surgery you get depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Surgeons can usually remove just the insulinoma from the surface of the pancreas. Other times, the surgeon may need to remove part of the pancreas connected to the tumor. But this is less common. \x1b[92m[1] You might be able to have laparoscopic surgery to remove an insulinoma\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] In this operation, doctors make several smaller cuts in your body instead of one large one\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] They use special instruments to do the surgery\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] That means you\'ll have less pain as you heal, stay fewer days in the hospital, and can return to normal life more quickly\x1b[0m. Most people won\'t need any more treatment after surgery. If your doctor thinks surgery won\'t work for you, you can try other treatments to manage low blood sugar. You might take medicine and eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. Cancerous insulinomas are rare, and they need different treatment. If your doctor can\'t remove the whole tumor, you may need to take medicine to prevent low blood sugar. You may also need chemotherapy. Depending on the type of tumor you have, another treatment option is getting a radioactive medicine called lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( Lutathera). You get this medicine through an IV.

32,22,"[""They may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite. In fact, dogs bite about 4.7 million Americans every year, half of them children between ages 5 and 9. One out of every five of those bites causes an injury that requires medical attention, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Children are also more likely than adults to be injured by a dog bite. Although strays or other strange dogs can bite, most of the time people are actually bitten by a dog they know, which could be a friend's dog or even the family pet. To prevent dog bites: When choosing a dog for a family pet, pick one with a good temperament. Stay away from any dogs you don't know. Never leave young children alone with a dog -- especially an unfamiliar one. Don't try to play with any dog that is eating or feeding her puppies. Whenever you approach a dog, do so slowly,and give the dog the chance to approach you. If a dog becomes aggressive, do not run away or scream. Stay calm, move slowly, and don't make eye contact with the dog. Although you can provide first aid for a dog bite at home, it's very important to see a doctor, especially if an unfamiliar dog bit you, the bite is deep, you can't stop the bleeding, or there are any signs of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus). Dog bites can cause infections that need to be treated with antibiotics. To care for a dog bite injury at home: Place a clean towel over the injury to stop any bleeding. Try to keep the injured area elevated. Wash the bite carefully with soap and water. Apply a sterile bandage to the wound. Apply antibiotic ointment to the injury every day to prevent infection. When you visit the doctor, be prepared to answer a few questions, including: Do you know the owner of the dog? If so, is the dog up to date on all vaccinations, including rabies? Did the bite occur because the dog was provoked, or was the dog unprovoked? What health conditions do you have? People with diabetes, liver disease, illnesses that suppress the immune system, and other health conditions may be at greater risk for a more severe infection. Your doctor will examine the injury to see whether the bite was deep enough to damage muscles, tendons, nerves, or bones. Then the doctor will thoroughly clean the bite wound to remove any dirt or bacteria, and may also remove dead tissues from the wound. Sometimes, sutures are used to close a dog bite wound; however, this practice is controversial. Although suturing the injury can reduce scarring, it also can increase the risk of infection. Whether the injury is closed may depend on its location. For example, dog bites on the face may be sutured to prevent visible scars. Very deep wounds that cause a great deal of damage may require plastic surgery. Your doctor will also take measures to prevent infection. It's rare for dogs in the U. S. to have rabies, but if the dog's health status is unknown, or the dog tests positive for rabies, you will need to get a rabies vaccine. ( Bear in mind that the dog would have to be euthanized and their brain tested for rabies.) The doctor will also make sure that you are up to date on your tetanus shot. You may need to take antibiotics for seven to 14 days to prevent or treat an infection. The doctor may ask you to come back in one to three days to have the injury rechecked. If you did not know the dog that bit you, make sure to report the bite to your local animal control office or police.""]",['https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites'],"[""https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites\nThey may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite.

33,21,"[""A computed tomography ( CT) scan is a test your doctor might use to look for a problem inside your body, plan your surgery, or check how well a treatment is working for you. It uses powerful X-rays, a form of radiation, to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Some people worry about getting this test because radiation is known as a possible cause of cancer. Know that the chances of getting cancer from a CT scan are very low. And for many people, the test is worth the small risk of radiation exposure. It can help doctors spot dangerous health problems and check that treatment works. Your doctor will make sure that the benefits you'd get from the scan outweigh the drawbacks before she recommends it for you. CT scans use X-rays, which are a type of radiation called ionizing radiation. It can damage the DNA in your cells and raise the chance that they'll turn cancerous. These scans expose you to more radiation than other imaging tests, like X-rays and mammograms. For example, one chest CT scan delivers the amount in 100 to 200 X-rays. That might sound like a lot, but the total amount you get is still very small. It's important to know that everyone is exposed to ionizing radiation every day, just from natural radioactive material in their surroundings. In a year, the average person gets about 3 millisieverts (m Sv), the units that scientists use to measure radiation. Each CT scan delivers 1 to 10 m Sv, depending on the dose of radiation and the part of your body that's getting the test. A low-dose chest CT scan is about 1.5 m Sv. The same test at a regular dose is about 7 m Sv. The more CT scans you have, the more radiation exposure you get. But that shouldn't stop you from getting them if your doctor says you need them. What are the chances that the X-rays from a scan will end up causing a problem? It depends on your age, gender, and the part of your body that's being scanned. Overall, your odds are very low -- the chance of getting a fatal cancer from any one CT scan is about 1 in 2,000. Some organs are more sensitive to radiation than others. It tends to do more damage to cells that grow and divide quickly. The breasts, lungs, thyroid gland, and bone marrow all have fast-dividing cells, so they are more sensitive than other body parts, like the brain. The possibility of cancer is slightly higher in women than in men. It's also higher in kids, because they're growing and their cells are dividing faster than those in adults. Children also have more years ahead of them in which they could get cancer from radiation. You don't need to stop getting CT scans. But it's a good idea to make sure you need each one you get. Before you have any imaging test, ask your doctor these questions: Why do I need this scan? How will it affect my treatment? What are the risks? Could you diagnose me with a test that doesn't use radiation, like an MRI or an ultrasound? How will you protect the rest of my body during the CT scan? Your doctor should use the smallest possible dose of radiation to do the scan -- especially if you need to have several of them. Ask if the technician can shield the parts of your body that don't need the test with a lead apron. This will block the X-rays from entering those areas. Keep a record of the CT scans and other X-rays you have, so you'll know how much radiation you're getting. It will also prevent you from repeating a test you've already done. Write down: The type of scan The date you had it The dose of radiation you got The name of the facility where you had the test If you're still concerned about radiation from a CT scan, you can always get a second opinion. Another doctor might be able to recommend other testing options.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/cancer/can-ct-scans-lead-to-cancer'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/can-ct-scans-lead-to-cancer\nA computed tomography ( CT) scan is a test your doctor might use to look for a problem inside your body, plan your surgery, or check how well a treatment is working for you.

Ask if \x1b[92m[8] the technician can shield the parts of your body that don't need the test with a lead apron\x1b[0m. This \x1b[92m[9] will block the X-rays from entering those areas\x1b[0m. Keep a record of the CT scans and other X-rays you have, so you'll know how much radiation you're getting. It will also prevent you from repeating a test you've already done.

It uses powerful X-rays, a form of radiation, to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Some people worry about getting this test because radiation is known as a possible cause of cancer. Know that the chances of getting cancer from a CT scan are very low. And for many people, the test is worth the small risk of radiation exposure. It can help doctors spot dangerous health problems and check that treatment works. Your doctor will make sure that \x1b[92m[6] the benefits you'd get from the scan outweigh the drawbacks\x1b[0m before she recommends it for you. CT scans use X-rays, which are a type of radiation called ionizing radiation. It can damage the DNA in your cells and raise the chance that they'll turn cancerous. These scans expose you to more radiation than other imaging tests, like X-rays and mammograms. For example, one chest CT scan delivers the amount in 100 to 200 X-rays. That might sound like a lot, but the total amount you get is still very small. It's important to know that everyone is exposed to ionizing radiation every day, just from natural radioactive material in their surroundings. In a year, the average person gets about 3 millisieverts (m Sv), the units that scientists use to measure radiation. Each CT scan delivers 1 to 10 m Sv, depending on the dose of radiation and the part of your body that's getting the test. A low-dose chest CT scan is about 1.5 m Sv. The same test at a regular dose is about 7 m Sv. The more CT scans you have, the more radiation exposure you get. But that shouldn't stop you from getting them if your doctor says you need them. What are the chances that the X-rays from a scan will end up causing a problem? It depends on your age, gender, and the part of your body that's being scanned. Overall, your odds are very low -- the chance of getting a fatal cancer from any one CT scan is about 1 in 2,000. Some organs are more sensitive to radiation than others. It tends to do more damage to cells that grow and divide quickly. The breasts, lungs, thyroid gland, and bone marrow all have fast-dividing cells, so they are more sensitive than other body parts, like the brain. The possibility of cancer is slightly higher in women than in men. It's also higher in kids, because they're growing and their cells are dividing faster than those in adults. Children also have more years ahead of them in which they could get cancer from radiation. You don't need to stop getting CT scans. But it's a good idea to make sure you need each one you get.

Remember, not everyone with genital herpes has symptoms, and herpes sores can be very hard to spot. Oral herpes, which causes sores on the mouth (known as cold sores of fever blisters), can be passed to the genitals through oral sex. If you think your partner is at high risk for genital herpes, you may consider asking him or her to be tested. In that case, you should be tested, too. Alcohol and illicit drugs lower inhibitions and impair judgment. People tend to be less careful about practicing safer sex while intoxicated and they often regret it later.

35,27,"[""A positron emission tomography ( PET) scan may be used to locate the part of the brain that is causing seizures. A PET scan is a test used to give doctors and their patients more information about how the cells in the body are functioning. A PET scan is done by injecting a small amount of radioactive material (known as a tracer) into a patient's vein, usually in the arm. The tracer sends out small, positively charged particles (positrons) that interact with negatively charged particles (electrons) in your body. The PET scanner is able to detect the product of this interaction and uses it to make an image. The PET scan shows the brain's use of oxygen or sugar (glucose). For patients with epilepsy, a PET scan is used to localize the part of the brain that is causing the seizure activity. However, doctors may request a PET scan for many different reasons. Aside from potential problems in the brain and spinal cord, the test can also be used to diagnose heart problems as well as certain kinds of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, colon, and prostate cancers and lymphoma. Before undergoing the PET procedure, be sure to tell your doctor of any medication -- prescription or non-prescription -- that you are taking, along with any herbal drugs or supplements you may be using. It is also very important that you tell the doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, since the PET scan can be harmful to an unborn child. As the test is about to begin, you will be asked to take off clothing that is covering the area of the body to be tested. Depending on the area of your body being tested, you may be asked to undress completely and put on a hospital gown. You will also be asked to remove any dentures, jewelry, or metal objects during the scan, because these items may affect the reading. A PET scan usually lasts 45-60 minutes. You will be asked to lie down on a flat table that is next to a scanner computer and a camera. You will then be given the tracer through an IV. After that, the PET scanner, a doughnut-shaped instrument, will move in circles around you. As this is happening, the camera will take pictures of patterns left by the tracer chemical inside your body. After the PET scan is finished, you will likely be asked to drink a lot of water or liquids during the next day in order to get rid of or flush the tracer chemical from your system. Because radiation is part of the test, there is a very small risk that cells or tissue may have received some damage following the PET procedure. However, the radiation levels from the tracer that is sent throughout the body are very low. In addition, following the scan, patients may find that their arm is a little bit sore or that they experience redness where the IV was placed in the arm. PET scans are usually more extensive and detailed than similar tests that are available.

36,26,"['Most cold and flu drugs attack symptoms, not the specific viruses. They aren\'t a cure, but they can ease your symptoms or shorten your illness. There\'s no one right way to treat a cold or the flu. But here are some questions to ask your pharmacist to get the right over-the-counter medication for you. This depends on your symptoms. If you have nasal or sinus congestion, then a decongestant can be helpful. If you have drainage -- either a runny nose or postnasal drip or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine may be helpful. Over-the-counter antihistamines often make people drowsy; decongestants can make people hyper or keep them awake. Antihistamines can make secretions thick, which can be a problem for people with asthma. Keep in mind that both these medications may interact with other drugs you may be taking for conditions such as heart disease, and they may worsen some conditions. Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist which cold medication may be best for you. Decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate, and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Pseudoephedrine is the primary oral decongestant available. In general, if your blood pressure is well controlled with medications, then a decongestant shouldn\'t be a problem as long as you monitor your blood pressure. This may not be true with certain types of blood pressure drugs. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about what may be best for you. Nasal decongestants work fast to open breathing passages. But if you use them for more than three days in a row, you may suffer a ""rebound effect,"" and end up more congested than you were at the start. Some doctors suggest using a saline spray instead of a medicated spray. Saline spray works more slowly but has no rebound effect. An occasional cough may clear the lung of pollutants and excess phlegm and probably shouldn\'t be treated. However, a persistent cough should be diagnosed and treated specifically. On the shelf you\'ll find numerous cough medicines with various combinations of decongestants, antihistamines, analgesics/antipyretics, cough suppressants, and expectorants. Ask your pharmacist which combination, if any, would be right for you. Fever may be a good thing. It helps the body fight off infection by suppressing the growth of bacteria and viruses and activating the immune system. Doctors no longer recommend suppressing fever for most people, except perhaps for the very young, the very old, and those with certain medical conditions such as heart disease or lung disease. However, if you are uncomfortable, it\'s fine to take these medications. Young people (including those in their early 20s), however, should avoid aspirin. Tylenol, or other medicines with acetaminophen, and Advil, or other medicines with ibuprofen, are best. Each type of medicine has its own set of risks, so check with your doctor or pharmacist as to which type of pain reliever or fever reducer is best for you. Be careful not to overdose! These drugs are often mixed in with cough and cold and flu remedies. Read the labels and don\'t take a separate pain remedy if your cough or cold medicine includes it. If you are unsure about the ingredients, talk to your pharmacist before taking the medicine. Drinking lots of fluids and using salt water gargles (made by combining a cup of warm water and a teaspoon of salt) can often be helpful for easing the pain of a sore throat. Some oral medications (such as Tylenol) and medicated lozenges and gargles can also temporarily soothe a sore throat. Get your doctor\'s approval before using any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, and don\'t use lozenges or gargles for more than a few days.

37,32,"['The cornea is the clear layer on the front of your eye that helps focus light so you can see clearly. If it gets damaged, you might need to have it replaced. The surgeon will remove all or part of your cornea and replace it with a healthy layer of tissue. The new cornea comes from people who chose to donate this tissue when they died. A cornea transplant, also called keratoplasty, can bring back vision, lessen pain, and possible improve the appearance of your cornea if it is white and scarred. The light rays that pass through a damaged cornea can get distorted and change your vision. A corneal transplant corrects several eye problems, including: Cornea scarring because of an injury or an infection Corneal ulcers or ""sores"" from an infection A medical condition that makes your cornea bulge out (keratoconus) Thinning, clouding, or swelling of the cornea Inherited eye diseases, such as Fuchs\' dystrophy and others Problems caused by an earlier eye operation Your doctor will let you know which specific procedure is best for your condition. If the doctor does a penetrating keratoplasty ( PK), all the layers of your cornea get replaced. The surgeon sews the new cornea onto your eye with stitches thinner than hair. You might need this procedure if you have a severe cornea injury or bad bulging and scarring. It has the longest healing time. During deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( DALK), the surgeon injects air to lift off and separate the thin outside and thick middle layers of your cornea, then removes and replaces only those. People with keratoconus or a corneal scar that hasn\'t affected the inner layers may have this done. The healing time with this procedure is shorter than a full thickness transplant. Because your eye itself isn\'t opened up, it\'s unlikely the lens and iris could be damaged, and there\'s less chance of an infection inside your eye. About half of the people who need cornea transplants each year have a problem with the innermost layer of the cornea, the endothelium. Doctors often do this type of surgery to help Fuchs\' dystrophy and other medical conditions. Descemet\'s stripping endothelial keratoplasty ( DSEK or DSAEK) is the most common type of endothelial keratoplasty. The surgeon removes the endothelium -- a mere one cell thick -- and the Descemet membrane just above it. Then he replaces them with a donated endothelium and Descemet membrane still attached to the stroma (the cornea\'s thick middle layer) to help him handle the new tissue without damaging it. Another variation, Descemet\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK), transplants just the endothelium and Descemet membrane -- no supporting stroma. The donor tissue is very thin and fragile, so it\'s harder to work with, but healing from this procedure is usually quicker. A third option for selected people wth Fuch\'s dystrophy is simple removal of the central part of the inner membrane without a transplant, if the surrounding cornea seems healthy enough to provide cells to fill in the removed area. These surgeries are good options for people with cornea damage only in the inner layer because recovery is easier. Before your operation, your doctor will probably do an exam and some lab tests to check that you\'re in good general health. You may have to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin, a couple of weeks before the procedure. Usually, you\'ll have to use antibiotic drops in your eye the day before your transplant to help prevent an infection. Most of the time, these surgeries are done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia. This means you\'ll be awake but woozy, the area is numb, and you\'ll be able to go home the same day. Your doctor will do the entire surgery while looking through a microscope. It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, you\'ll probably wear an eye patch for at least a day, maybe 4, until the top layer of your cornea heals. Your eye will most likely be red and sensitive to light. It might hurt or feel sore for a few days, but some people don\'t feel any discomfort. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection. He may prescribe other medicines to help with pain. He\'ll want to check your eye the day after surgery, several times during the following couple of weeks, and then a few more times during the first year. For transplant procedures such as DSEK and DMEK that use a gas bubble inside the eye to help position the transplanted tissue, the surgeon may ask you to lie flat sometimes during the day and sleep flat on your back at night for a few days. You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures. Other things that could happen include: Infection Bleeding Higher pressure in the eye (called glaucoma) Clouding of the eye\'s lens (called cataracts) Swelling of the cornea A detached retina, when the back inside surface of your eye pulls away from its normal position Most people who have a cornea transplant get at least part of their vision restored, but each situation is different. It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round. After the first year, you should see your eye doctor once or twice every year. The donated tissue usually lasts a lifetime.']",['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/cornea-transplant-surgery'],"['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/cornea-transplant-surgery\nThe cornea is the clear layer on the front of your eye that helps focus light so you can see clearly.

During deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( DALK), the surgeon injects air to lift off and separate the thin outside and thick middle layers of your cornea, then removes and replaces only those. People with keratoconus or a corneal scar that hasn\'t affected the inner layers may have this done. The healing time with this procedure is shorter than a full thickness transplant. Because your eye itself isn\'t opened up, it\'s unlikely the lens and iris could be damaged, and there\'s less chance of an infection inside your eye. About half of the people who need cornea transplants each year have a problem with the innermost layer of the cornea, the endothelium. Doctors often do this type of surgery to help Fuchs\' dystrophy and other medical conditions. Descemet\'s stripping endothelial keratoplasty ( DSEK or DSAEK) is the most common type of endothelial keratoplasty. The surgeon removes the endothelium -- a mere one cell thick -- and the Descemet membrane just above it. Then he replaces them with a donated endothelium and Descemet membrane still attached to the stroma (the cornea\'s thick middle layer) to help him handle the new tissue without damaging it. Another variation, Descemet\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK), transplants just the endothelium and Descemet membrane -- no supporting stroma. The donor tissue is very thin and fragile, so it\'s harder to work with, but healing from this procedure is usually quicker. A third option for selected people wth Fuch\'s dystrophy is simple removal of the central part of the inner membrane without a transplant, if the surrounding cornea seems healthy enough to provide cells to fill in the removed area. These surgeries are good options for people with cornea damage only in the inner layer because recovery is easier. Before your operation, your doctor will probably do an exam and some lab tests to check that you\'re in good general health. You may have to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin, a couple of weeks before the procedure. Usually, you\'ll have to use antibiotic drops in your eye the day before your transplant to help prevent an infection. Most of the time, these surgeries are done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia. This means you\'ll be awake but woozy, the area is numb, and you\'ll be able to go home the same day. Your doctor will do the entire surgery while looking through a microscope. It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, you\'ll probably wear an eye patch for at least a day, maybe 4, until the top layer of your cornea heals. Your eye will most likely be red and sensitive to light. It might hurt or feel sore for a few days, but some people don\'t feel any discomfort. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection. \x1b[92m[2] He may prescribe other medicines to help with pain\x1b[0m. He\'ll want to check your eye the day after surgery, several times during the following couple of weeks, and then a few more times during the first year. For transplant procedures such as DSEK and DMEK that use a gas bubble inside the eye to help position the transplanted tissue, the surgeon may ask you to lie flat sometimes during the day and sleep flat on your back at night for a few days. You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. \x1b[92m[3] Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully\x1b[0m. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures. Other things that could happen include: Infection Bleeding Higher pressure in the eye (called glaucoma) Clouding of the eye\'s lens (called cataracts) Swelling of the cornea A detached retina, when the back inside surface of your eye pulls away from its normal position Most people who have a cornea transplant get at least part of their vision restored, but each situation is different. It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round. After the first year, you should see your eye doctor once or twice every year. The donated tissue usually lasts a lifetime.']",Do I need medications to recover from cornea transplant surgery?,"Post-cornea transplant surgery, your doctor will prescribe eye drops to reduce inflammation and prevent infection, along with possible pain medication [92m[2][0m.

38,36,"[""Radiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you're struggling with fatigue. She might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you're feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated. Don't scrub or rub your skin. To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it. Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to. Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. Stay out of the sun as much as possible. Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it. Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors. If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra. If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire. Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. And you'll still need to protect yourself from the sun even after radiation therapy has ended. Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it's usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. But it's important to keep eating a healthy diet while you're having treatment to keep your body strong. Try eating five or six small meals spread out through the day instead of three large ones. Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. She can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. She'll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn't try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don't go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated.

39,27,"[""A positron emission tomography ( PET) scan may be used to locate the part of the brain that is causing seizures. A PET scan is a test used to give doctors and their patients more information about how the cells in the body are functioning. A PET scan is done by injecting a small amount of radioactive material (known as a tracer) into a patient's vein, usually in the arm. The tracer sends out small, positively charged particles (positrons) that interact with negatively charged particles (electrons) in your body. The PET scanner is able to detect the product of this interaction and uses it to make an image. The PET scan shows the brain's use of oxygen or sugar (glucose). For patients with epilepsy, a PET scan is used to localize the part of the brain that is causing the seizure activity. However, doctors may request a PET scan for many different reasons. Aside from potential problems in the brain and spinal cord, the test can also be used to diagnose heart problems as well as certain kinds of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, colon, and prostate cancers and lymphoma. Before undergoing the PET procedure, be sure to tell your doctor of any medication -- prescription or non-prescription -- that you are taking, along with any herbal drugs or supplements you may be using. It is also very important that you tell the doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, since the PET scan can be harmful to an unborn child. As the test is about to begin, you will be asked to take off clothing that is covering the area of the body to be tested. Depending on the area of your body being tested, you may be asked to undress completely and put on a hospital gown. You will also be asked to remove any dentures, jewelry, or metal objects during the scan, because these items may affect the reading. A PET scan usually lasts 45-60 minutes. You will be asked to lie down on a flat table that is next to a scanner computer and a camera. You will then be given the tracer through an IV. After that, the PET scanner, a doughnut-shaped instrument, will move in circles around you. As this is happening, the camera will take pictures of patterns left by the tracer chemical inside your body. After the PET scan is finished, you will likely be asked to drink a lot of water or liquids during the next day in order to get rid of or flush the tracer chemical from your system. Because radiation is part of the test, there is a very small risk that cells or tissue may have received some damage following the PET procedure. However, the radiation levels from the tracer that is sent throughout the body are very low. In addition, following the scan, patients may find that their arm is a little bit sore or that they experience redness where the IV was placed in the arm. PET scans are usually more extensive and detailed than similar tests that are available. Despite this, test results can usually be given to the patient a day or two after the scan.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/pet-scan-epilepsy'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/pet-scan-epilepsy\nA positron emission tomography ( PET) scan may be used to locate the part of the brain that is causing seizures.

40,36,"[""Radiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you're struggling with fatigue. She might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you're feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated. Don't scrub or rub your skin. To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it. Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to. Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. Stay out of the sun as much as possible. Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it. Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors. If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra. If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire. Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. And you'll still need to protect yourself from the sun even after radiation therapy has ended. Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it's usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. But it's important to keep eating a healthy diet while you're having treatment to keep your body strong. Try eating five or six small meals spread out through the day instead of three large ones. Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. She can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. She'll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn't try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don't go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later.

If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you're struggling with fatigue. She might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you're feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. \x1b[92m[1] Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Don't scrub or rub your skin\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin\x1b[0m. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. \x1b[92m[6] Stay out of the sun as much as possible\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to\x1b[0m. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. And you'll still need to protect yourself from the sun even after radiation therapy has ended. Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it's usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. But it's important to keep eating a healthy diet while you're having treatment to keep your body strong. Try eating five or six small meals spread out through the day instead of three large ones. Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. She can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. She'll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn't try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don't go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated. Talk with your doctor about the potential risk and how it compares to the benefits you'll get from radiation therapy.""]",How can you take care of your skin from radiation therapy?,"To care for your skin during radiation therapy, wear loose clothing and avoid scrubbing or rubbing the treated area [92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.

41,27,"[""A positron emission tomography ( PET) scan may be used to locate the part of the brain that is causing seizures. A PET scan is a test used to give doctors and their patients more information about how the cells in the body are functioning. A PET scan is done by injecting a small amount of radioactive material (known as a tracer) into a patient's vein, usually in the arm. The tracer sends out small, positively charged particles (positrons) that interact with negatively charged particles (electrons) in your body. The PET scanner is able to detect the product of this interaction and uses it to make an image. The PET scan shows the brain's use of oxygen or sugar (glucose). For patients with epilepsy, a PET scan is used to localize the part of the brain that is causing the seizure activity. However, doctors may request a PET scan for many different reasons. Aside from potential problems in the brain and spinal cord, the test can also be used to diagnose heart problems as well as certain kinds of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, colon, and prostate cancers and lymphoma. Before undergoing the PET procedure, be sure to tell your doctor of any medication -- prescription or non-prescription -- that you are taking, along with any herbal drugs or supplements you may be using. It is also very important that you tell the doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, since the PET scan can be harmful to an unborn child. As the test is about to begin, you will be asked to take off clothing that is covering the area of the body to be tested. Depending on the area of your body being tested, you may be asked to undress completely and put on a hospital gown. You will also be asked to remove any dentures, jewelry, or metal objects during the scan, because these items may affect the reading. A PET scan usually lasts 45-60 minutes. You will be asked to lie down on a flat table that is next to a scanner computer and a camera. You will then be given the tracer through an IV. After that, the PET scanner, a doughnut-shaped instrument, will move in circles around you. As this is happening, the camera will take pictures of patterns left by the tracer chemical inside your body. After the PET scan is finished, you will likely be asked to drink a lot of water or liquids during the next day in order to get rid of or flush the tracer chemical from your system. Because radiation is part of the test, there is a very small risk that cells or tissue may have received some damage following the PET procedure. However, the radiation levels from the tracer that is sent throughout the body are very low. In addition, following the scan, patients may find that their arm is a little bit sore or that they experience redness where the IV was placed in the arm. PET scans are usually more extensive and detailed than similar tests that are available. Despite this, test results can usually be given to the patient a day or two after the scan.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/pet-scan-epilepsy'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/pet-scan-epilepsy\nA positron emission tomography ( PET) scan may be used to locate the part of the brain that is causing seizures.

If your baby makes noises when breathing, take note of what they sound like. This will help determine if there is a problem in the breathing passages and where: Whistling noise: A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths. This is a good trick, as it allows them to breathe and eat at the same time. However, their little noses have small air passages, so a little bit of mucus or dried milk can make the breathing passage even smaller, causing a whistling noise or occasionally, difficulty moving the air in and out. Hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough: A blockage in the larynx (windpipe), often due to mucus, makes a hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough. This may be a sign of croup, an infection of the larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes. High-pitched, squeaky sound: Called stridor or laryngomalacia, this is a sound very young babies make when breathing in. It is worse when a child is lying on his or her back. It is caused by excess tissue around the larynx and is typically harmless. It typically passes by the time a child reaches age 2. Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on). Fast, labored breathing: Fluid in the smallest airways (the ""alveoli"") causes pneumonia, an infection due to a virus or bacteria. Pneumonia causes fast, labored breathing, occasionally cyanosis, a persistent cough, and crackly sounds (""rales"") when listened to with a stethoscope.

When in doubt of what\'s going on, make a video of the breathing pattern that is worrying you to show to your baby\'s health care provider. Signs of potentially worrisome breathing problems in your baby include: Persistently increased rate of breathing (greater than 60 breaths per minute or so) Increased work to breathe. Signs of this include: Grunting. The baby makes a little grunting noise at the end of respiration. This serves to try to open up blocked airways. Flaring. The baby\'s nostrils flare during breathing, showing increased effort. Retractions. The muscles in the baby\'s chest (under the ribs) and neck are visibly seen going in and out much more deeply than usual. Cyanosis. This means the blood has remained blue and has not gotten sufficient oxygen from the lungs (such as with pneumonia). For true cyanosis, the blood all over the body should look blue. Check areas that get a lot of blood flow, such as the lips and the tongue. Sometimes, the hands and feet of newborns turn bluish, but the rest of the body is fine. This is not cyanosis but a common response to changes in temperature. Poor feeding. "" Respiratory distress"" is often accompanied by a noticeable decrease in feeding intake. Lethargy. Your baby\'s energy level may be markedly decreased if she has a significant lung problem. Fever. Most infections of the lung will cause a fever, as well.

High-pitched, squeaky sound: Called stridor or laryngomalacia, this is a sound very young babies make when breathing in. It is worse when a child is lying on his or her back. It is caused by excess tissue around the larynx and is typically harmless. It typically passes by the time a child reaches age 2. Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on). Fast, labored breathing: Fluid in the smallest airways (the ""alveoli"") causes pneumonia, an infection due to a virus or bacteria. Pneumonia causes fast, labored breathing, occasionally \x1b[92m[6] cyanosis\x1b[0m, a persistent cough, and crackly sounds (""rales"") when listened to with a stethoscope. Watch your baby\'s breathing when she\'s well, so you can get used to how it looks. Time how many breaths she takes in a minute. It\'s probably faster than you imagined. Knowing what\'s normal for your baby\'s breathing will help you spot a potential problem more quickly. When in doubt of what\'s going on, make a video of the breathing pattern that is worrying you to show to your baby\'s health care provider. Signs of potentially worrisome breathing problems in your baby include: \x1b[92m[1] Persistently increased rate of breathing (greater than 60 breaths per minute or so)\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] Increased work to breathe\x1b[0m. Signs of this include: \x1b[92m[3] Grunting\x1b[0m. The baby makes a little grunting noise at the end of respiration. This serves to try to open up blocked airways. \x1b[92m[4] Flaring\x1b[0m. The baby\'s nostrils flare during breathing, showing increased effort. \x1b[92m[5] Retractions\x1b[0m. The muscles in the baby\'s chest (under the ribs) and neck are visibly seen going in and out much more deeply than usual. Cyanosis. This means the blood has remained blue and has not gotten sufficient oxygen from the lungs (such as with pneumonia). For true \x1b[92m[6] cyanosis\x1b[0m, the blood all over the body should look blue. Check areas that get a lot of blood flow, such as the lips and the tongue. Sometimes, the hands and feet of newborns turn bluish, but the rest of the body is fine. This is not \x1b[92m[6] cyanosis\x1b[0m but a common response to changes in temperature. \x1b[92m[7] Poor feeding\x1b[0m. "" Respiratory distress"" is often accompanied by a noticeable decrease in feeding intake. \x1b[92m[8] Lethargy\x1b[0m. Your baby\'s energy level may be markedly decreased if she has a significant lung problem. \x1b[92m[9] Fever\x1b[0m. Most infections of the lung will cause a fever, as well. Always check your baby\'s temperature when you are concerned. Breathing problems (such as noisy breathing) that only occur occasionally are normal. \x1b[92m[10] Worrisome breathing problems, on the other hand, are usually persistent\x1b[0m. However, \x1b[92m[11] when it comes to any breathing concerns, be sure to contact your pediatrician\x1b[0m.']",When should you worry about your baby's breathing?,"Worry about your baby's breathing if they persistently breathe over 60 times per minute, show signs of struggling such as grunting, nostril flaring, or skin pulling in around the ribs, turn blue, have trouble feeding, seem unusually lethargic, or have a fever [92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m[92m[8][0m[92m[9][0m[92m[10][0m.

You do need to take prediabetes seriously, but there\'s still time to turn things around -- if you start now. The goal is to get your blood sugar level out of the prediabetes range, and keep it that way. What you do every day makes a big difference. Making lifestyle changes may be even more powerful than just taking medication. That\'s what happened in a large study called the Diabetes Prevention Program: People with prediabetes who lost a small amount of weight through diet and exercise cut their odds of getting type 2 diabetes by 58%, compared to 31% for people who only took the prescription drug metformin. Start by making these three changes. If you\'re overweight, slimming down is the key to turning the odds in your favor. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. To reach your goal, limit portion sizes; cut calories; and eat fewer foods that are high in fat (especially saturated fat), sugar, and carbohydrates. You should also eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Leading an active life is a must. Aim for 30 minutes of aerobic activity (something that raises your heart rate, like walking, biking, or swimming) 5 days a week (150 minutes per week). Plus, do some strength-training exercise, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, at least twice a week. Strength work builds muscle, which helps lower your blood sugar level, helps your body respond better to insulin (which controls blood sugar), and burns calories even when you\'re not moving. Smoking is strongly linked to diabetes: People who smoke are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who don\'t. And people with diabetes who continue smoking are more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and blindness. So the sooner you ditch the cigarettes, the better. While lifestyle changes can work wonders, some people with prediabetes also need medication. Your doctor may prescribe metformin if you have certain risk factors, such as low levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol, high triglycerides (a type of blood fat), a parent or sibling with diabetes, or are overweight. If you take metformin, you\'ll need to follow up with your doctor. You\'ll also need to keep up a healthy lifestyle.

44,32,"['The cornea is the clear layer on the front of your eye that helps focus light so you can see clearly. If it gets damaged, you might need to have it replaced. The surgeon will remove all or part of your cornea and replace it with a healthy layer of tissue. The new cornea comes from people who chose to donate this tissue when they died. A cornea transplant, also called keratoplasty, can bring back vision, lessen pain, and possible improve the appearance of your cornea if it is white and scarred. The light rays that pass through a damaged cornea can get distorted and change your vision. A corneal transplant corrects several eye problems, including: Cornea scarring because of an injury or an infection Corneal ulcers or ""sores"" from an infection A medical condition that makes your cornea bulge out (keratoconus) Thinning, clouding, or swelling of the cornea Inherited eye diseases, such as Fuchs\' dystrophy and others Problems caused by an earlier eye operation Your doctor will let you know which specific procedure is best for your condition. If the doctor does a penetrating keratoplasty ( PK), all the layers of your cornea get replaced. The surgeon sews the new cornea onto your eye with stitches thinner than hair. You might need this procedure if you have a severe cornea injury or bad bulging and scarring. It has the longest healing time. During deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( DALK), the surgeon injects air to lift off and separate the thin outside and thick middle layers of your cornea, then removes and replaces only those. People with keratoconus or a corneal scar that hasn\'t affected the inner layers may have this done. The healing time with this procedure is shorter than a full thickness transplant. Because your eye itself isn\'t opened up, it\'s unlikely the lens and iris could be damaged, and there\'s less chance of an infection inside your eye. About half of the people who need cornea transplants each year have a problem with the innermost layer of the cornea, the endothelium. Doctors often do this type of surgery to help Fuchs\' dystrophy and other medical conditions. Descemet\'s stripping endothelial keratoplasty ( DSEK or DSAEK) is the most common type of endothelial keratoplasty. The surgeon removes the endothelium -- a mere one cell thick -- and the Descemet membrane just above it. Then he replaces them with a donated endothelium and Descemet membrane still attached to the stroma (the cornea\'s thick middle layer) to help him handle the new tissue without damaging it. Another variation, Descemet\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK), transplants just the endothelium and Descemet membrane -- no supporting stroma. The donor tissue is very thin and fragile, so it\'s harder to work with, but healing from this procedure is usually quicker. A third option for selected people wth Fuch\'s dystrophy is simple removal of the central part of the inner membrane without a transplant, if the surrounding cornea seems healthy enough to provide cells to fill in the removed area. These surgeries are good options for people with cornea damage only in the inner layer because recovery is easier. Before your operation, your doctor will probably do an exam and some lab tests to check that you\'re in good general health. You may have to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin, a couple of weeks before the procedure. Usually, you\'ll have to use antibiotic drops in your eye the day before your transplant to help prevent an infection. Most of the time, these surgeries are done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia. This means you\'ll be awake but woozy, the area is numb, and you\'ll be able to go home the same day. Your doctor will do the entire surgery while looking through a microscope. It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, you\'ll probably wear an eye patch for at least a day, maybe 4, until the top layer of your cornea heals. Your eye will most likely be red and sensitive to light. It might hurt or feel sore for a few days, but some people don\'t feel any discomfort. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection. He may prescribe other medicines to help with pain. He\'ll want to check your eye the day after surgery, several times during the following couple of weeks, and then a few more times during the first year. For transplant procedures such as DSEK and DMEK that use a gas bubble inside the eye to help position the transplanted tissue, the surgeon may ask you to lie flat sometimes during the day and sleep flat on your back at night for a few days. You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures. Other things that could happen include: Infection Bleeding Higher pressure in the eye (called glaucoma) Clouding of the eye\'s lens (called cataracts) Swelling of the cornea A detached retina, when the back inside surface of your eye pulls away from its normal position Most people who have a cornea transplant get at least part of their vision restored, but each situation is different. It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round. After the first year, you should see your eye doctor once or twice every year.

It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round. After the first year, you should see your eye doctor once or twice every year. The donated tissue usually lasts a lifetime.']",Do I need medications to recover from cornea transplant surgery?,"['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/cornea-transplant-surgery\nThe cornea is the clear layer on the front of your eye that helps focus light so you can see clearly. If it gets damaged, you might need to have it replaced. The surgeon will remove all or part of your cornea and replace it with a healthy layer of tissue. The new cornea comes from people who chose to donate this tissue when they died. A cornea transplant, also called keratoplasty, can bring back vision, lessen pain, and possible improve the appearance of your cornea if it is white and scarred. The light rays that pass through a damaged cornea can get distorted and change your vision. A corneal transplant corrects several eye problems, including: Cornea scarring because of an injury or an infection Corneal ulcers or ""sores"" from an infection A medical condition that makes your cornea bulge out (keratoconus) Thinning, clouding, or swelling of the cornea Inherited eye diseases, such as Fuchs\' dystrophy and others Problems caused by an earlier eye operation Your doctor will let you know which specific procedure is best for your condition. If the doctor does a penetrating keratoplasty ( PK), all the layers of your cornea get replaced. The surgeon sews the new cornea onto your eye with stitches thinner than hair. You might need this procedure if you have a severe cornea injury or bad bulging and scarring. It has the longest healing time. During deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( DALK), the surgeon injects air to lift off and separate the thin outside and thick middle layers of your cornea, then removes and replaces only those. People with keratoconus or a corneal scar that hasn\'t affected the inner layers may have this done. The healing time with this procedure is shorter than a full thickness transplant. Because your eye itself isn\'t opened up, it\'s unlikely the lens and iris could be damaged, and there\'s less chance of an infection inside your eye. About half of the people who need cornea transplants each year have a problem with the innermost layer of the cornea, the endothelium. Doctors often do this type of surgery to help Fuchs\' dystrophy and other medical conditions. Descemet\'s stripping endothelial keratoplasty ( DSEK or DSAEK) is the most common type of endothelial keratoplasty. The surgeon removes the endothelium -- a mere one cell thick -- and the Descemet membrane just above it. Then he replaces them with a donated endothelium and Descemet membrane still attached to the stroma (the cornea\'s thick middle layer) to help him handle the new tissue without damaging it. Another variation, Descemet\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK), transplants just the endothelium and Descemet membrane -- no supporting stroma. The donor tissue is very thin and fragile, so it\'s harder to work with, but healing from this procedure is usually quicker. A third option for selected people wth Fuch\'s dystrophy is simple removal of the central part of the inner membrane without a transplant, if the surrounding cornea seems healthy enough to provide cells to fill in the removed area. These surgeries are good options for people with cornea damage only in the inner layer because recovery is easier. Before your operation, your doctor will probably do an exam and some lab tests to check that you\'re in good general health. You may have to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin, a couple of weeks before the procedure. Usually, you\'ll have to use antibiotic drops in your eye the day before your transplant to help prevent an infection. Most of the time, these surgeries are done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia. This means you\'ll be awake but woozy, the area is numb, and you\'ll be able to go home the same day. Your doctor will do the entire surgery while looking through a microscope. It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, you\'ll probably wear an eye patch for at least a day, maybe 4, until the top layer of your cornea heals. Your eye will most likely be red and sensitive to light. It might hurt or feel sore for a few days, but some people don\'t feel any discomfort. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection. \x1b[92m He may prescribe other medicines to help with pain\x1b[0m. He\'ll want to check your eye the day after surgery, several times during the following couple of weeks, and then a few more times during the first year. For transplant procedures such as DSEK and DMEK that use a gas bubble inside the eye to help position the transplanted tissue, the surgeon may ask you to lie flat sometimes during the day and sleep flat on your back at night for a few days. You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. \x1b[92m Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully\x1b[0m. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures.

45,20,"['An insulinoma is a rare tumor of the pancreas. It\'s made of calls called beta islet cells, the same ones in the pancreas the make insulin and control your blood sugar. Normally, your pancreas makes more insulin when your blood sugar is high and less when your blood sugar is low. But an insulinoma constantly makes insulin, even when your blood sugar gets too low. You might hear an insulinoma called a ""neuroendocrine tumor"" because it starts in special cells in your body called neuroendocrine cells. These tumors are usually small (less than an inch), and almost all of them are not cancer. In most cases, surgery can cure them. Because insulomas make too much insulin, they can cause symptoms of low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia. You might have: Confusion Sweating Weakness Anxiety A fast heartbeat Headache Vision changes Personality changes Irritability Lack of muscle coordination Blurred vision Lethargy Seizure Hypoglycemia can be dangerous. If your blood sugar drops very low, you could faint or go into a coma. Hypoglycemia is common in people with diabetes. It often happens because they took too much of their medicine, missed a meal, or got more exercise than usual, all of which can lower blood sugar. An insulinoma can also cause hypoglycemia when you haven\'t eaten in a while, but it can happen at any time. It\'s not clear why some people get insulinomas. Women are slightly more likely to have them than men, and most people get them between ages 40 and 60. You\'re also more likely to have an insulinoma if you have certain genetic diseases, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: When tumors grow in glands that make hormones Von Hippel- Lindau syndrome: When tumors and cysts grow in many organs throughout the body Neurofibromatosis type 1 : Noncancerous tumors in the nerves and skin Tuberous sclerosis : Noncancerous tumors that grow in organs like your brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, and lungs It can be tough for doctors to diagnose an insulinoma. Its symptoms are the same as other common health problems. It may take time before your doctor can find it. You\'ll get tests like: Blood tests and suppression test. To find out if you have an insulinoma, your doctor will test your blood sugar, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during a 72-hour rest. This will confirm that: You have symptoms of low blood sugar, especially after not eating or heavy exercise Your blood sugar is actually low when you have those symptoms Your symptoms go away after your blood sugar goes up To do that, they will watch what happens to your blood sugar after you fast for a day to two. You may need to stay in the hospital during this time, and you won\'t be able to eat or drink anything except water. The doctor will test your blood to see if you have both low blood sugar and a high insulin level. Imaging test. You may also get an imaging test such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI so your doctor can see where the tumor is. The main treatment for an insulinoma is surgery to remove the tumor. Most of the time, that will cure you. The type of surgery you get depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Surgeons can usually remove just the insulinoma from the surface of the pancreas. Other times, the surgeon may need to remove part of the pancreas connected to the tumor. But this is less common. You might be able to have laparoscopic surgery to remove an insulinoma. In this operation, doctors make several smaller cuts in your body instead of one large one. They use special instruments to do the surgery. That means you\'ll have less pain as you heal, stay fewer days in the hospital, and can return to normal life more quickly. Most people won\'t need any more treatment after surgery. If your doctor thinks surgery won\'t work for you, you can try other treatments to manage low blood sugar. You might take medicine and eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. Cancerous insulinomas are rare, and they need different treatment. If your doctor can\'t remove the whole tumor, you may need to take medicine to prevent low blood sugar. You may also need chemotherapy. Depending on the type of tumor you have, another treatment option is getting a radioactive medicine called lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( Lutathera). You get this medicine through an IV.

But this is less common. \x1b[92m You might be able to have laparoscopic surgery to remove an insulinoma\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m In this operation, doctors make several smaller cuts in your body instead of one large one\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m They use special instruments to do the surgery\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m That means you\'ll have less pain as you heal, stay fewer days in the hospital, and can return to normal life more quickly\x1b[0m. Most people won\'t need any more treatment after surgery. If your doctor thinks surgery won\'t work for you, you can try other treatments to manage low blood sugar. You might take medicine and eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. Cancerous insulinomas are rare, and they need different treatment. If your doctor can\'t remove the whole tumor, you may need to take medicine to prevent low blood sugar. You may also need chemotherapy. Depending on the type of tumor you have, another treatment option is getting a radioactive medicine called lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( Lutathera). You get this medicine through an IV. This drug attaches itself to part of the tumor cell, and the radiation from the drug damages the cell.']",,,,,,,,,Snippet

It helps make the outer membranes of our bodies\' cells stable. But for decades, doctors have known that people with high total cholesterol levels are more likely to get heart disease. More recently, they\'ve found the different forms of cholesterol (""good"" and ""bad"") also play a role. High total cholesterol, high bad cholesterol, or low good cholesterol could raise your chances. For example, LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol can stick to blood vessel walls. Over years, it can play a role in clogging arteries in a process called atherosclerosis. Narrowed arteries in your heart can then develop sudden blood clots, causing heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends that everyone over age 20 get a cholesterol test so you know what your levels are and can do something about them if you need to. The different kinds of cholesterol and other fats in your blood are together called lipids. Doctors measure and diagnose lipid problems with a simple blood test. You\'ll probably have to fast for 9 to 12 hours before it to make sure it\'s not affected by any food you recently ate. A lipid profile usually gives results for four different types: Total cholesterol LDL (low-density lipoprotein), the ""bad cholesterol"" HDL (high-density lipoprotein), the ""good cholesterol"" Triglycerides, another form of fat Some lipid panels can give even more detailed information, like the presence and sizes of various fat particles in your blood. Researchers are looking into what, if any, effect these traits have on heart disease. There\'s no clear guidelines on when this more advanced testing is needed. So you\'ve gone hungry overnight, endured a small bloodletting, and dutifully returned to get your results. Now, what do the numbers mean? For total cholesterol: 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) or less is normal. 201 to 240 mg/d L is borderline. More than 240 mg/d L is high. For HDL (""good cholesterol""), more is better: 60 mg/d L or higher is good -- it protects against heart disease. 40 to 59 mg/d L is OK. Less than 40 mg/d L is low, raising your chance of heart disease. For LDL (""bad cholesterol""), lower is better: Less than 100 mg/d L is ideal. 100 to 129 mg/d L can be good, depending on your health. 130 to 159 mg/d L is borderline high. 160 to 189 mg/d L is high. 190 mg/d L or more is very high. Your doctor will consider your overall likelihood of heart disease to set your personal LDL goal. For people at great risk of heart disease, or who already have it, your LDL should be less than 100 mg/d L. ( Your heart doctor might recommend an even lower LDL -- less than 70 mg/d L -- if your risk of heart disease is very high.) If you have a moderately high chance, an LDL less than 130 mg/d L is your target. If you\'re not likely to get heart disease, less than 160 mg/d L is probably fine. High triglycerides (150 mg/d L or greater) also raise the odds for heart disease somewhat. Lifestyle changes are the first thing to tackle to reduce your chance of heart disease. A cholesterol-lowering diet can bring down bad cholesterol by up to 30%. A diet low in saturated fat (7% of total calories or less) and no more than 200 mg of cholesterol daily can lower LDL cholesterol. Fiber and plant sterols (found in special margarines and other foods) help, too. Regular aerobic exercise can both lower bad cholesterol ( LDL) and raise good cholesterol ( HDL). If diet and exercise don\'t lower cholesterol levels enough, you can try medications or a combination of treatments including: Statins, the most effective and commonly used cholesterol drugs Niacin Fibrates Zetia Bile acid sequestrants Your cholesterol numbers don\'t determine your destiny. Remember, other things besides cholesterol can also lead to heart disease. Diabetes, smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, exercise, and genetics are important as well. People with normal cholesterol can have heart disease; people with high cholesterol can have healthy hearts. Overall, though, more people whose cholesterol levels are off will get heart disease. Experts recommend follow-up cholesterol testing every 5 years for most people. If your lipid results aren\'t what you and your doctor had hoped for, or if you have other reasons to be concerned about heart disease, you\'ll need cholesterol tests more often.']",['https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/guide/tests-for-high-cholesterol-lipid-panel'],"['https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/guide/tests-for-high-cholesterol-lipid-panel\nvar s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context[\'wb.modimp\'] = \'vidfloat\'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $(\'.responsive-video-container\').insert After(\'.module-social-share-container\'); require([\'video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader\'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === \'desktop\' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $(\'article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)\').attr(\'chronic_id\'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: \'in-article\', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $(\'.responsive-video-container\').remove(); }); } Cholesterol is a form of fat we need.

Although scientists are still not completely sure why we have earwax, it does trap dust and other small particles and prevent them from reaching, and potentially damaging or infecting the eardrum. Normally, the wax dries up and falls out of the ear, along with any trapped dust or debris. Everyone makes ear wax, but the amount and type are genetically determined just like hair color or height. Smaller or oddly shaped ear canals may make it difficult for the naturally occurring wax to get out of the canal and lead to wax impactions. Blockage, or impaction, also occurs when the wax gets pushed deep within the ear canal. Earwax blockage is one of the most common ear problems doctors see. The most common cause of impactions is the use of Q-tips (and other objects such as bobby pins and rolled napkin corners), which can remove superficial wax but also pushes the rest of the wax deeper into the ear canal. Hearing aid and earplug users are also more prone to earwax blockage. Symptoms of an earwax impaction include: Decreased hearing Dizziness Ear pain Plugged or fullness sensation Ringing in the ear Itching or drainage from the ear canal See your doctor if you think you may have any symptoms of an earwax impaction. Other conditions may cause these symptoms and it is important to be sure earwax is the culprit before trying any home remedies. Go to the hospital if: You have a severe spinning sensation, loss of balance, or inability to walk You have persistent vomiting or high fever You experience sudden loss of hearing A doctor can diagnose earwax blockage (or eardrum perforation) by listening to your symptoms and then looking into your ear with an otoscope (ear-scope). Your doctor may recommend that you try an earwax removal method at home, unless you have a perforation (hole) or a tube in your eardrum. Over-the-counter wax softening drops such as Debrox or Murine may be put into the affected ear and then allowed to drain out after about five minutes while holding the head to the side, allowing the drops to settle. Sitting up again will let the drops drain out by themselves. A bulb-type syringe may be used to gently flush the ear with warm water. The water should be at body temperature to help prevent dizziness. Ear candling is not recommended. The procedure uses a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth on the tapered end. The tapered end is placed inside the ear, and an assistant lights the other end, while making sure your hair does not catch on fire. In theory, as the flame burns, a vacuum is created, which draws the wax out of the ear. Limited clinical trials, however, showed that no vacuum was created, and no wax was removed. Furthermore, this practice may result in serious injury. The doctor may remove your earwax with a small plastic spoon called a curette, or irrigate your ear with warmed water, sodium bicarbonate, or other prescription-strength eardrops. The doctor may also use gentle suction to remove the wax. Earwax blockage can often be prevented by avoiding the use of cotton-tipped swabs or Q-tips and other objects that push the wax deeper into the ear canal.

Your doctor may recommend that you try an earwax removal method at home, unless you have a perforation (hole) or a tube in your eardrum. Over-the-counter wax softening drops such as Debrox or Murine may be put into the affected ear and then allowed to drain out after about five minutes while holding the head to the side, allowing the drops to settle. Sitting up again will let the drops drain out by themselves. A bulb-type syringe may be used to gently flush the ear with warm water. The water should be at body temperature to help prevent dizziness. Ear candling is not recommended. The procedure uses a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth on the tapered end. The tapered end is placed inside the ear, and an assistant lights the other end, while making sure your hair does not catch on fire. In theory, as the flame burns, a vacuum is created, which draws the wax out of the ear. Limited clinical trials, however, showed that no vacuum was created, and no wax was removed. Furthermore, this practice may result in serious injury.

48,39,"[""A latex condom may protect you from the herpes virus if it covers the infected area. Most people who have genital herpes don't know they're infected, so ask whether he or she has had any other sexually transmitted disease. People with a history of STDs are more likely to have genital herpes. It may be awkward, but it's important to be honest with each other. Your partner may be afraid to tell you the truth if he or she fears a negative reaction. If your partner feels comfortable talking with you, you'll be more likely to get straight answers. Someone who has had many sexual partners is more likely to be infected with the herpes virus. The fewer sexual partners you have in your lifetime, the less likely you are to be exposed to the herpes virus. If you know your partner has genital herpes, always abstain from sex when symptoms are present. Or, if you see a sore on someone's genitals, don't have sex with that person until you're sure he or she doesn't have genital herpes. Remember, not everyone with genital herpes has symptoms, and herpes sores can be very hard to spot. Oral herpes, which causes sores on the mouth (known as cold sores of fever blisters), can be passed to the genitals through oral sex. If you think your partner is at high risk for genital herpes, you may consider asking him or her to be tested. In that case, you should be tested, too. Alcohol and illicit drugs lower inhibitions and impair judgment. People tend to be less careful about practicing safer sex while intoxicated and they often regret it later. The only way to be 100% certain you won't get a sexually transmitted disease is to have just one sex partner who has no STDs -- and only if both of you stay monogamous. If you don't want to be monogamous or totally celibate until you find a life partner, you could greatly reduce the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease by doing things that don't involve genital-genital contact or oral-genital contact, such as mutual masturbation.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/reduce-risk'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/reduce-risk\n\x1b[92m[1] A latex condom may protect you from the herpes virus if it covers the infected area\x1b[0m.

Although scientists are still not completely sure why we have earwax, it does trap dust and other small particles and prevent them from reaching, and potentially damaging or infecting the eardrum. Normally, the wax dries up and falls out of the ear, along with any trapped dust or debris. Everyone makes ear wax, but the amount and type are genetically determined just like hair color or height. Smaller or oddly shaped ear canals may make it difficult for the naturally occurring wax to get out of the canal and lead to wax impactions. Blockage, or impaction, also occurs when the wax gets pushed deep within the ear canal. Earwax blockage is one of the most common ear problems doctors see. The most common cause of impactions is the use of Q-tips (and other objects such as bobby pins and rolled napkin corners), which can remove superficial wax but also pushes the rest of the wax deeper into the ear canal. Hearing aid and earplug users are also more prone to earwax blockage. Symptoms of an earwax impaction include: Decreased hearing Dizziness Ear pain Plugged or fullness sensation Ringing in the ear Itching or drainage from the ear canal See your doctor if you think you may have any symptoms of an earwax impaction. Other conditions may cause these symptoms and it is important to be sure earwax is the culprit before trying any home remedies. Go to the hospital if: You have a severe spinning sensation, loss of balance, or inability to walk You have persistent vomiting or high fever You experience sudden loss of hearing A doctor can diagnose earwax blockage (or eardrum perforation) by listening to your symptoms and then looking into your ear with an otoscope (ear-scope). Your doctor may recommend that you try an earwax removal method at home, unless you have a perforation (hole) or a tube in your eardrum. Over-the-counter wax softening drops such as Debrox or Murine may be put into the affected ear and then allowed to drain out after about five minutes while holding the head to the side, allowing the drops to settle.

The water should be at body temperature to help prevent dizziness. Ear candling is not recommended. The procedure uses a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth on the tapered end. The tapered end is placed inside the ear, and an assistant lights the other end, while making sure your hair does not catch on fire.

50,21,"[""A computed tomography ( CT) scan is a test your doctor might use to look for a problem inside your body, plan your surgery, or check how well a treatment is working for you. It uses powerful X-rays, a form of radiation, to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Some people worry about getting this test because radiation is known as a possible cause of cancer. Know that the chances of getting cancer from a CT scan are very low. And for many people, the test is worth the small risk of radiation exposure. It can help doctors spot dangerous health problems and check that treatment works. Your doctor will make sure that the benefits you'd get from the scan outweigh the drawbacks before she recommends it for you. CT scans use X-rays, which are a type of radiation called ionizing radiation. It can damage the DNA in your cells and raise the chance that they'll turn cancerous. These scans expose you to more radiation than other imaging tests, like X-rays and mammograms. For example, one chest CT scan delivers the amount in 100 to 200 X-rays. That might sound like a lot, but the total amount you get is still very small. It's important to know that everyone is exposed to ionizing radiation every day, just from natural radioactive material in their surroundings. In a year, the average person gets about 3 millisieverts (m Sv), the units that scientists use to measure radiation. Each CT scan delivers 1 to 10 m Sv, depending on the dose of radiation and the part of your body that's getting the test. A low-dose chest CT scan is about 1.5 m Sv. The same test at a regular dose is about 7 m Sv. The more CT scans you have, the more radiation exposure you get. But that shouldn't stop you from getting them if your doctor says you need them. What are the chances that the X-rays from a scan will end up causing a problem? It depends on your age, gender, and the part of your body that's being scanned. Overall, your odds are very low -- the chance of getting a fatal cancer from any one CT scan is about 1 in 2,000. Some organs are more sensitive to radiation than others. It tends to do more damage to cells that grow and divide quickly. The breasts, lungs, thyroid gland, and bone marrow all have fast-dividing cells, so they are more sensitive than other body parts, like the brain. The possibility of cancer is slightly higher in women than in men. It's also higher in kids, because they're growing and their cells are dividing faster than those in adults. Children also have more years ahead of them in which they could get cancer from radiation. You don't need to stop getting CT scans. But it's a good idea to make sure you need each one you get. Before you have any imaging test, ask your doctor these questions: Why do I need this scan? How will it affect my treatment? What are the risks? Could you diagnose me with a test that doesn't use radiation, like an MRI or an ultrasound? How will you protect the rest of my body during the CT scan? Your doctor should use the smallest possible dose of radiation to do the scan -- especially if you need to have several of them. Ask if the technician can shield the parts of your body that don't need the test with a lead apron. This will block the X-rays from entering those areas. Keep a record of the CT scans and other X-rays you have, so you'll know how much radiation you're getting. It will also prevent you from repeating a test you've already done. Write down: The type of scan The date you had it The dose of radiation you got The name of the facility where you had the test If you're still concerned about radiation from a CT scan, you can always get a second opinion.

51,31,"['Photophobia literally means ""fear of light."" If you have photophobia, you\'re not actually afraid of light, but you are very sensitive to it. The sun or bright indoor light can be uncomfortable, even painful. Photophobia isn\'t a condition -- it\'s a symptom of another problem. Migraine headaches, dry eyes, and swelling inside your eye are commonly linked to light sensitivity. It can cause pain whenever you\'re in bright sunlight or indoor light. You might want to blink or close your eyes. Some people also get headaches. Photophobia is linked to the connection between cells in your eyes that detect light and a nerve that goes to your head. Migraines are the most common cause of light sensitivity. Up to 80% of people who get them have photophobia along with their headaches. Many of those people are light sensitive even when they don\'t have a headache. Other types of headaches can cause photophobia, too. People who get tension and cluster headaches also say they\'re uncomfortable around bright light. A few brain conditions can cause photophobia, including: Meningitis (swelling of the protective coverings of your brain and spinal cord) Serious brain injury Supranuclear palsy (a brain disorder that causes problems with balance, walking, and eye movement) Tumors in your pituitary gland Some eye diseases cause this symptom, including: Dry eye Uveitis (swelling of the inside of your eye) Keratitis (swelling of your cornea, the clear layer that covers the colored part of your eye) Iritis (swelling of the colored ring around your pupil) Cataracts (cloudy coverings over the lenses of your eyes) Corneal abrasion (a scratch on your cornea) Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear tissue that sits over the white part of your eye) Damage to your retina, the light-sensitive layer in the back of your eye Blepharospasm (a condition that makes your eyelids close uncontrollably) Photophobia may also affect some people who have these mental health conditions: Agoraphobia (a fear of being in public places) Anxiety Bipolar disorder Depression Panic disorder You can also get photophobia after you have LASIK or other surgery to fix vision problems. Certain wavelengths of light -- like the blue light your computer and smartphone give off -- cause the most sensitivity. Some medicines can also cause photophobia, including: Antibiotics, such as doxycycline and tetracycline. Furosemide ( Lasix): This keeps your body from holding on to too much fluid. It\'s used to treat congestive heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, and other conditions. Quinine ( Qualaquin): This is a drug used to treat malaria. If you think you have photophobia, see your eye doctor. She\'ll ask about your symptoms and any medical conditions you have. Then she\'ll check the health of your eyes and possibly your brain. Tests your doctor might use include: Slit-lamp eye exam. She\'ll use a special microscope with a light to examine your eyes. MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of your eyes. Exam of the tear film. This checks the amount of tears you make to see if you have dry eyes. The best way to ease photophobia is to treat the condition or stop taking the medicine that\'s causing it. If you\'re still affected by it, tinted glasses may help. Some people have found relief from rose-colored lenses called FL-41. But tinted lenses aren\'t for everyone.

52,32,"['The cornea is the clear layer on the front of your eye that helps focus light so you can see clearly. If it gets damaged, you might need to have it replaced. The surgeon will remove all or part of your cornea and replace it with a healthy layer of tissue. The new cornea comes from people who chose to donate this tissue when they died. A cornea transplant, also called keratoplasty, can bring back vision, lessen pain, and possible improve the appearance of your cornea if it is white and scarred. The light rays that pass through a damaged cornea can get distorted and change your vision. A corneal transplant corrects several eye problems, including: Cornea scarring because of an injury or an infection Corneal ulcers or ""sores"" from an infection A medical condition that makes your cornea bulge out (keratoconus) Thinning, clouding, or swelling of the cornea Inherited eye diseases, such as Fuchs\' dystrophy and others Problems caused by an earlier eye operation Your doctor will let you know which specific procedure is best for your condition. If the doctor does a penetrating keratoplasty ( PK), all the layers of your cornea get replaced. The surgeon sews the new cornea onto your eye with stitches thinner than hair. You might need this procedure if you have a severe cornea injury or bad bulging and scarring. It has the longest healing time. During deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( DALK), the surgeon injects air to lift off and separate the thin outside and thick middle layers of your cornea, then removes and replaces only those. People with keratoconus or a corneal scar that hasn\'t affected the inner layers may have this done. The healing time with this procedure is shorter than a full thickness transplant. Because your eye itself isn\'t opened up, it\'s unlikely the lens and iris could be damaged, and there\'s less chance of an infection inside your eye. About half of the people who need cornea transplants each year have a problem with the innermost layer of the cornea, the endothelium. Doctors often do this type of surgery to help Fuchs\' dystrophy and other medical conditions. Descemet\'s stripping endothelial keratoplasty ( DSEK or DSAEK) is the most common type of endothelial keratoplasty. The surgeon removes the endothelium -- a mere one cell thick -- and the Descemet membrane just above it. Then he replaces them with a donated endothelium and Descemet membrane still attached to the stroma (the cornea\'s thick middle layer) to help him handle the new tissue without damaging it. Another variation, Descemet\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK), transplants just the endothelium and Descemet membrane -- no supporting stroma. The donor tissue is very thin and fragile, so it\'s harder to work with, but healing from this procedure is usually quicker. A third option for selected people wth Fuch\'s dystrophy is simple removal of the central part of the inner membrane without a transplant, if the surrounding cornea seems healthy enough to provide cells to fill in the removed area. These surgeries are good options for people with cornea damage only in the inner layer because recovery is easier. Before your operation, your doctor will probably do an exam and some lab tests to check that you\'re in good general health. You may have to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin, a couple of weeks before the procedure. Usually, you\'ll have to use antibiotic drops in your eye the day before your transplant to help prevent an infection. Most of the time, these surgeries are done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia. This means you\'ll be awake but woozy, the area is numb, and you\'ll be able to go home the same day. Your doctor will do the entire surgery while looking through a microscope. It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, you\'ll probably wear an eye patch for at least a day, maybe 4, until the top layer of your cornea heals. Your eye will most likely be red and sensitive to light. It might hurt or feel sore for a few days, but some people don\'t feel any discomfort. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection. He may prescribe other medicines to help with pain. He\'ll want to check your eye the day after surgery, several times during the following couple of weeks, and then a few more times during the first year. For transplant procedures such as DSEK and DMEK that use a gas bubble inside the eye to help position the transplanted tissue, the surgeon may ask you to lie flat sometimes during the day and sleep flat on your back at night for a few days. You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures. Other things that could happen include: Infection Bleeding Higher pressure in the eye (called glaucoma) Clouding of the eye\'s lens (called cataracts) Swelling of the cornea A detached retina, when the back inside surface of your eye pulls away from its normal position Most people who have a cornea transplant get at least part of their vision restored, but each situation is different. It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round. After the first year, you should see your eye doctor once or twice every year.

You might need this procedure if you have a severe cornea injury or bad bulging and scarring. It has the longest healing time. During deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( DALK), the surgeon injects air to lift off and separate the thin outside and thick middle layers of your cornea, then removes and replaces only those. People with keratoconus or a corneal scar that hasn\'t affected the inner layers may have this done. The healing time with this procedure is shorter than a full thickness transplant. Because your eye itself isn\'t opened up, it\'s unlikely the lens and iris could be damaged, and there\'s less chance of an infection inside your eye. About half of the people who need cornea transplants each year have a problem with the innermost layer of the cornea, the endothelium. Doctors often do this type of surgery to help Fuchs\' dystrophy and other medical conditions. Descemet\'s stripping endothelial keratoplasty ( DSEK or DSAEK) is the most common type of endothelial keratoplasty. The surgeon removes the endothelium -- a mere one cell thick -- and the Descemet membrane just above it. Then he replaces them with a donated endothelium and Descemet membrane still attached to the stroma (the cornea\'s thick middle layer) to help him handle the new tissue without damaging it. Another variation, Descemet\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK), transplants just the endothelium and Descemet membrane -- no supporting stroma. The donor tissue is very thin and fragile, so it\'s harder to work with, but healing from this procedure is usually quicker. A third option for selected people wth Fuch\'s dystrophy is simple removal of the central part of the inner membrane without a transplant, if the surrounding cornea seems healthy enough to provide cells to fill in the removed area. These surgeries are good options for people with cornea damage only in the inner layer because recovery is easier. Before your operation, your doctor will probably do an exam and some lab tests to check that you\'re in good general health. You may have to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin, a couple of weeks before the procedure. Usually, you\'ll have to use antibiotic drops in your eye the day before your transplant to help prevent an infection. Most of the time, these surgeries are done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia. This means you\'ll be awake but woozy, the area is numb, and you\'ll be able to go home the same day. Your doctor will do the entire surgery while looking through a microscope. It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, you\'ll probably wear an eye patch for at least a day, maybe 4, until the top layer of your cornea heals. Your eye will most likely be red and sensitive to light. It might hurt or feel sore for a few days, but some people don\'t feel any discomfort. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection. \x1b[92m[2] He may prescribe other medicines to help with pain\x1b[0m. He\'ll want to check your eye the day after surgery, several times during the following couple of weeks, and then a few more times during the first year. For transplant procedures such as DSEK and DMEK that use a gas bubble inside the eye to help position the transplanted tissue, the surgeon may ask you to lie flat sometimes during the day and sleep flat on your back at night for a few days. You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. \x1b[92m[3] Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully\x1b[0m. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures. Other things that could happen include: Infection Bleeding Higher pressure in the eye (called glaucoma) Clouding of the eye\'s lens (called cataracts) Swelling of the cornea A detached retina, when the back inside surface of your eye pulls away from its normal position Most people who have a cornea transplant get at least part of their vision restored, but each situation is different. It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round. After the first year, you should see your eye doctor once or twice every year. The donated tissue usually lasts a lifetime.']",Do I need medications to recover from cornea transplant surgery?,"Post-cornea transplant recovery typically involves prescribed eye drops to reduce inflammation and prevent infection, along with possible pain management medication [92m[2][0m.

There\'s no one right way to treat a cold or the flu. But here are some questions to ask your pharmacist to get the right over-the-counter medication for you. This depends on your symptoms. If you have nasal or sinus congestion, then a decongestant can be helpful. If you have drainage -- either a runny nose or postnasal drip or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine may be helpful. Over-the-counter antihistamines often make people drowsy; decongestants can make people hyper or keep them awake. Antihistamines can make secretions thick, which can be a problem for people with asthma. Keep in mind that both these medications may interact with other drugs you may be taking for conditions such as heart disease, and they may worsen some conditions. Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist which cold medication may be best for you. Decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate, and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Pseudoephedrine is the primary oral decongestant available. In general, if your blood pressure is well controlled with medications, then a decongestant shouldn\'t be a problem as long as you monitor your blood pressure. This may not be true with certain types of blood pressure drugs. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about what may be best for you. Nasal decongestants work fast to open breathing passages. But if you use them for more than three days in a row, you may suffer a ""rebound effect,"" and end up more congested than you were at the start. Some doctors suggest using a saline spray instead of a medicated spray. Saline spray works more slowly but has no rebound effect. An occasional cough may clear the lung of pollutants and excess phlegm and probably shouldn\'t be treated. However, a persistent cough should be diagnosed and treated specifically. On the shelf you\'ll find numerous cough medicines with various combinations of decongestants, antihistamines, analgesics/antipyretics, cough suppressants, and expectorants. Ask your pharmacist which combination, if any, would be right for you. Fever may be a good thing. It helps the body fight off infection by suppressing the growth of bacteria and viruses and activating the immune system. Doctors no longer recommend suppressing fever for most people, except perhaps for the very young, the very old, and those with certain medical conditions such as heart disease or lung disease. However, if you are uncomfortable, it\'s fine to take these medications. Young people (including those in their early 20s), however, should avoid aspirin. Tylenol, or other medicines with acetaminophen, and Advil, or other medicines with ibuprofen, are best. Each type of medicine has its own set of risks, so check with your doctor or pharmacist as to which type of pain reliever or fever reducer is best for you. Be careful not to overdose! These drugs are often mixed in with cough and cold and flu remedies. Read the labels and don\'t take a separate pain remedy if your cough or cold medicine includes it. If you are unsure about the ingredients, talk to your pharmacist before taking the medicine. Drinking lots of fluids and using salt water gargles (made by combining a cup of warm water and a teaspoon of salt) can often be helpful for easing the pain of a sore throat. Some oral medications (such as Tylenol) and medicated lozenges and gargles can also temporarily soothe a sore throat.

54,36,"[""Radiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you're struggling with fatigue. She might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you're feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated. Don't scrub or rub your skin. To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it. Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to. Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. Stay out of the sun as much as possible. Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it. Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors. If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra. If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire. Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. And you'll still need to protect yourself from the sun even after radiation therapy has ended. Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it's usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. But it's important to keep eating a healthy diet while you're having treatment to keep your body strong. Try eating five or six small meals spread out through the day instead of three large ones. Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. She can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. She'll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn't try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don't go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated. Talk with your doctor about the potential risk and how it compares to the benefits you'll get from radiation therapy.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-to-expect-from-radiation-therapy'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-to-expect-from-radiation-therapy\nRadiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells.

Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. She can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. She'll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn't try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don't go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated. Talk with your doctor about the potential risk and how it compares to the benefits you'll get from radiation therapy.""]","[""https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-to-expect-from-radiation-therapy\nRadiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you're struggling with fatigue. She might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you're feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. \x1b[92m[1] Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] Don't scrub or rub your skin\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[3] To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[5] Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin\x1b[0m. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. \x1b[92m[6] Stay out of the sun as much as possible\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[10] If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[11] Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to\x1b[0m. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. And you'll still need to protect yourself from the sun even after radiation therapy has ended. Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it's usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation.

55,21,"[""A computed tomography ( CT) scan is a test your doctor might use to look for a problem inside your body, plan your surgery, or check how well a treatment is working for you. It uses powerful X-rays, a form of radiation, to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Some people worry about getting this test because radiation is known as a possible cause of cancer. Know that the chances of getting cancer from a CT scan are very low. And for many people, the test is worth the small risk of radiation exposure. It can help doctors spot dangerous health problems and check that treatment works. Your doctor will make sure that the benefits you'd get from the scan outweigh the drawbacks before she recommends it for you. CT scans use X-rays, which are a type of radiation called ionizing radiation. It can damage the DNA in your cells and raise the chance that they'll turn cancerous. These scans expose you to more radiation than other imaging tests, like X-rays and mammograms. For example, one chest CT scan delivers the amount in 100 to 200 X-rays. That might sound like a lot, but the total amount you get is still very small. It's important to know that everyone is exposed to ionizing radiation every day, just from natural radioactive material in their surroundings. In a year, the average person gets about 3 millisieverts (m Sv), the units that scientists use to measure radiation. Each CT scan delivers 1 to 10 m Sv, depending on the dose of radiation and the part of your body that's getting the test. A low-dose chest CT scan is about 1.5 m Sv. The same test at a regular dose is about 7 m Sv. The more CT scans you have, the more radiation exposure you get. But that shouldn't stop you from getting them if your doctor says you need them. What are the chances that the X-rays from a scan will end up causing a problem? It depends on your age, gender, and the part of your body that's being scanned. Overall, your odds are very low -- the chance of getting a fatal cancer from any one CT scan is about 1 in 2,000. Some organs are more sensitive to radiation than others. It tends to do more damage to cells that grow and divide quickly. The breasts, lungs, thyroid gland, and bone marrow all have fast-dividing cells, so they are more sensitive than other body parts, like the brain. The possibility of cancer is slightly higher in women than in men. It's also higher in kids, because they're growing and their cells are dividing faster than those in adults. Children also have more years ahead of them in which they could get cancer from radiation. You don't need to stop getting CT scans. But it's a good idea to make sure you need each one you get. Before you have any imaging test, ask your doctor these questions: Why do I need this scan? How will it affect my treatment? What are the risks? Could you diagnose me with a test that doesn't use radiation, like an MRI or an ultrasound? How will you protect the rest of my body during the CT scan? Your doctor should use the smallest possible dose of radiation to do the scan -- especially if you need to have several of them. Ask if the technician can shield the parts of your body that don't need the test with a lead apron. This will block the X-rays from entering those areas. Keep a record of the CT scans and other X-rays you have, so you'll know how much radiation you're getting. It will also prevent you from repeating a test you've already done. Write down: The type of scan The date you had it The dose of radiation you got The name of the facility where you had the test If you're still concerned about radiation from a CT scan, you can always get a second opinion.

56,20,"['An insulinoma is a rare tumor of the pancreas. It\'s made of calls called beta islet cells, the same ones in the pancreas the make insulin and control your blood sugar. Normally, your pancreas makes more insulin when your blood sugar is high and less when your blood sugar is low. But an insulinoma constantly makes insulin, even when your blood sugar gets too low. You might hear an insulinoma called a ""neuroendocrine tumor"" because it starts in special cells in your body called neuroendocrine cells. These tumors are usually small (less than an inch), and almost all of them are not cancer. In most cases, surgery can cure them. Because insulomas make too much insulin, they can cause symptoms of low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia. You might have: Confusion Sweating Weakness Anxiety A fast heartbeat Headache Vision changes Personality changes Irritability Lack of muscle coordination Blurred vision Lethargy Seizure Hypoglycemia can be dangerous. If your blood sugar drops very low, you could faint or go into a coma. Hypoglycemia is common in people with diabetes. It often happens because they took too much of their medicine, missed a meal, or got more exercise than usual, all of which can lower blood sugar. An insulinoma can also cause hypoglycemia when you haven\'t eaten in a while, but it can happen at any time. It\'s not clear why some people get insulinomas. Women are slightly more likely to have them than men, and most people get them between ages 40 and 60. You\'re also more likely to have an insulinoma if you have certain genetic diseases, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: When tumors grow in glands that make hormones Von Hippel- Lindau syndrome: When tumors and cysts grow in many organs throughout the body Neurofibromatosis type 1 : Noncancerous tumors in the nerves and skin Tuberous sclerosis : Noncancerous tumors that grow in organs like your brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, and lungs It can be tough for doctors to diagnose an insulinoma. Its symptoms are the same as other common health problems. It may take time before your doctor can find it. You\'ll get tests like: Blood tests and suppression test. To find out if you have an insulinoma, your doctor will test your blood sugar, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during a 72-hour rest. This will confirm that: You have symptoms of low blood sugar, especially after not eating or heavy exercise Your blood sugar is actually low when you have those symptoms Your symptoms go away after your blood sugar goes up To do that, they will watch what happens to your blood sugar after you fast for a day to two. You may need to stay in the hospital during this time, and you won\'t be able to eat or drink anything except water. The doctor will test your blood to see if you have both low blood sugar and a high insulin level. Imaging test. You may also get an imaging test such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI so your doctor can see where the tumor is. The main treatment for an insulinoma is surgery to remove the tumor. Most of the time, that will cure you. The type of surgery you get depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Surgeons can usually remove just the insulinoma from the surface of the pancreas. Other times, the surgeon may need to remove part of the pancreas connected to the tumor. But this is less common. You might be able to have laparoscopic surgery to remove an insulinoma. In this operation, doctors make several smaller cuts in your body instead of one large one. They use special instruments to do the surgery. That means you\'ll have less pain as you heal, stay fewer days in the hospital, and can return to normal life more quickly. Most people won\'t need any more treatment after surgery. If your doctor thinks surgery won\'t work for you, you can try other treatments to manage low blood sugar. You might take medicine and eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. Cancerous insulinomas are rare, and they need different treatment. If your doctor can\'t remove the whole tumor, you may need to take medicine to prevent low blood sugar. You may also need chemotherapy. Depending on the type of tumor you have, another treatment option is getting a radioactive medicine called lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( Lutathera). You get this medicine through an IV.

Good timing will help you avoid low blood sugar levels. \x1b[92m[2] Rapid acting insulins: About 15 minutes before mealtime\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] Short-acting insulins: 30 to 60 minutes before a meal\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[4] Intermediate-acting insulins: Up to 1 hour prior to a meal\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[5] Pre-mixed insulins: Depending on the product, between 10 minutes or 30 to 45 minutes before mealtime\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] Long-acting insulins aren\'t tied to mealtimes\x1b[0m. You\'ll take detemir ( Levemir) once or twice a day no matter when you eat. And you\'ll take glargine ( Basaglar, Lantus, Toujeo) once a day, always at the same time. Deglutec is taken once a day, and the time of day can be flexible. But some people do have to pair a long-acting insulin with a shorter-acting type or another medication that does have to be taken at meal time. \x1b[92m[1] Rapid-acting\x1b[0m products can also be taken right after you eat, rather than 15 minutes before mealtime. You can take some of them at bedtime. For more information about when to take insulin, read the ""dosing and administration"" section of the insulin product package insert that came with your insulin product, or talk with your doctor.']",How long before eating should I use the different types of insulins?,"The various insulin types include Rapid-acting, Short-acting, Intermediate-acting, Long-acting, and Pre-mixed [92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m.

If your baby makes noises when breathing, take note of what they sound like. This will help determine if there is a problem in the breathing passages and where: Whistling noise: A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths. This is a good trick, as it allows them to breathe and eat at the same time. However, their little noses have small air passages, so a little bit of mucus or dried milk can make the breathing passage even smaller, causing a whistling noise or occasionally, difficulty moving the air in and out. Hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough: A blockage in the larynx (windpipe), often due to mucus, makes a hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough. This may be a sign of croup, an infection of the larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes. High-pitched, squeaky sound: Called stridor or laryngomalacia, this is a sound very young babies make when breathing in. It is worse when a child is lying on his or her back. It is caused by excess tissue around the larynx and is typically harmless. It typically passes by the time a child reaches age 2. Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on). Fast, labored breathing: Fluid in the smallest airways (the ""alveoli"") causes pneumonia, an infection due to a virus or bacteria. Pneumonia causes fast, labored breathing, occasionally cyanosis, a persistent cough, and crackly sounds (""rales"") when listened to with a stethoscope.

When in doubt of what\'s going on, make a video of the breathing pattern that is worrying you to show to your baby\'s health care provider. Signs of potentially worrisome breathing problems in your baby include: Persistently increased rate of breathing (greater than 60 breaths per minute or so) Increased work to breathe. Signs of this include: Grunting. The baby makes a little grunting noise at the end of respiration. This serves to try to open up blocked airways. Flaring. The baby\'s nostrils flare during breathing, showing increased effort. Retractions. The muscles in the baby\'s chest (under the ribs) and neck are visibly seen going in and out much more deeply than usual. Cyanosis. This means the blood has remained blue and has not gotten sufficient oxygen from the lungs (such as with pneumonia). For true cyanosis, the blood all over the body should look blue. Check areas that get a lot of blood flow, such as the lips and the tongue. Sometimes, the hands and feet of newborns turn bluish, but the rest of the body is fine. This is not cyanosis but a common response to changes in temperature. Poor feeding. "" Respiratory distress"" is often accompanied by a noticeable decrease in feeding intake. Lethargy. Your baby\'s energy level may be markedly decreased if she has a significant lung problem. Fever. Most infections of the lung will cause a fever, as well.

Although scientists are still not completely sure why we have earwax, it does trap dust and other small particles and prevent them from reaching, and potentially damaging or infecting the eardrum. Normally, the wax dries up and falls out of the ear, along with any trapped dust or debris. Everyone makes ear wax, but the amount and type are genetically determined just like hair color or height. Smaller or oddly shaped ear canals may make it difficult for the naturally occurring wax to get out of the canal and lead to wax impactions. Blockage, or impaction, also occurs when the wax gets pushed deep within the ear canal. Earwax blockage is one of the most common ear problems doctors see. The most common cause of impactions is the use of Q-tips (and other objects such as bobby pins and rolled napkin corners), which can remove superficial wax but also pushes the rest of the wax deeper into the ear canal. Hearing aid and earplug users are also more prone to earwax blockage. Symptoms of an earwax impaction include: Decreased hearing Dizziness Ear pain Plugged or fullness sensation Ringing in the ear Itching or drainage from the ear canal See your doctor if you think you may have any symptoms of an earwax impaction. Other conditions may cause these symptoms and it is important to be sure earwax is the culprit before trying any home remedies. Go to the hospital if: You have a severe spinning sensation, loss of balance, or inability to walk You have persistent vomiting or high fever You experience sudden loss of hearing A doctor can diagnose earwax blockage (or eardrum perforation) by listening to your symptoms and then looking into your ear with an otoscope (ear-scope). Your doctor may recommend that you try an earwax removal method at home, unless you have a perforation (hole) or a tube in your eardrum. Over-the-counter wax softening drops such as Debrox or Murine may be put into the affected ear and then allowed to drain out after about five minutes while holding the head to the side, allowing the drops to settle. Sitting up again will let the drops drain out by themselves. A bulb-type syringe may be used to gently flush the ear with warm water. The water should be at body temperature to help prevent dizziness. Ear candling is not recommended. The procedure uses a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth on the tapered end. The tapered end is placed inside the ear, and an assistant lights the other end, while making sure your hair does not catch on fire. In theory, as the flame burns, a vacuum is created, which draws the wax out of the ear. Limited clinical trials, however, showed that no vacuum was created, and no wax was removed. Furthermore, this practice may result in serious injury. The doctor may remove your earwax with a small plastic spoon called a curette, or irrigate your ear with warmed water, sodium bicarbonate, or other prescription-strength eardrops. The doctor may also use gentle suction to remove the wax. Earwax blockage can often be prevented by avoiding the use of cotton-tipped swabs or Q-tips and other objects that push the wax deeper into the ear canal. Complications of earwax blockages include: Perforated eardrum Middle-ear infection External-ear infection (swimmer's ear ) Permanent hearing loss from acoustic trauma""]",['https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ear-wax'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ear-wax\nvar s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; 1) https://musom.marshall.edu/anatomy/grosshom/z_ EAR.htm; (2) http://www.entnet.org/content/earwax-and-care (paragraph 2); (3) http://www.entnet.org/content/earwax-and-care (paragraph 2); (4) http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/yucky/earwax.html (paragraph 3); (5) http://healthtools.aarp.org/health/earwax-buildup (paragraph 1); Leah Curney, host. ; Noah Forman, host. ; Sound Effects: free SFX.

Hearing aid and earplug users are also more prone to earwax blockage. Symptoms of an earwax impaction include: Decreased hearing Dizziness Ear pain Plugged or fullness sensation Ringing in the ear Itching or drainage from the ear canal See your doctor if you think you may have any symptoms of an earwax impaction. Other conditions may cause these symptoms and it is important to be sure earwax is the culprit before trying any home remedies. Go to the hospital if: You have a severe spinning sensation, loss of balance, or inability to walk You have persistent vomiting or high fever You experience sudden loss of hearing A doctor can diagnose earwax blockage (or eardrum perforation) by listening to your symptoms and then looking into your ear with an otoscope (ear-scope). Your doctor may recommend that you try an earwax removal method at home, unless you have a perforation (hole) or a tube in your eardrum. Over-the-counter wax softening drops such as Debrox or Murine may be put into the affected ear and then allowed to drain out after about five minutes while holding the head to the side, allowing the drops to settle. Sitting up again will let the drops drain out by themselves. A bulb-type syringe may be used to gently flush the ear with warm water. The water should be at body temperature to help prevent dizziness. Ear candling is not recommended. The procedure uses a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth on the tapered end. The tapered end is placed inside the ear, and an assistant lights the other end, while making sure your hair does not catch on fire. In theory, as the flame burns, a vacuum is created, which draws the wax out of the ear. Limited clinical trials, however, showed that no vacuum was created, and no wax was removed. Furthermore, this practice may result in serious injury. The doctor may remove your earwax with a small plastic spoon called a curette, or irrigate your ear with warmed water, sodium bicarbonate, or other prescription-strength eardrops. The doctor may also use gentle suction to remove the wax. Earwax blockage can often be prevented by \x1b[92m[1] avoiding the use of cotton-tipped swabs or Q-tips and other objects that push the wax deeper into the ear canal\x1b[0m.

Although scientists are still not completely sure why we have earwax, it does trap dust and other small particles and prevent them from reaching, and potentially damaging or infecting the eardrum. Normally, the wax dries up and falls out of the ear, along with any trapped dust or debris. Everyone makes ear wax, but the amount and type are genetically determined just like hair color or height. Smaller or oddly shaped ear canals may make it difficult for the naturally occurring wax to get out of the canal and lead to wax impactions.

60,22,"[""They may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite. In fact, dogs bite about 4.7 million Americans every year, half of them children between ages 5 and 9. One out of every five of those bites causes an injury that requires medical attention, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Children are also more likely than adults to be injured by a dog bite. Although strays or other strange dogs can bite, most of the time people are actually bitten by a dog they know, which could be a friend's dog or even the family pet. To prevent dog bites: When choosing a dog for a family pet, pick one with a good temperament. Stay away from any dogs you don't know. Never leave young children alone with a dog -- especially an unfamiliar one. Don't try to play with any dog that is eating or feeding her puppies. Whenever you approach a dog, do so slowly,and give the dog the chance to approach you. If a dog becomes aggressive, do not run away or scream. Stay calm, move slowly, and don't make eye contact with the dog. Although you can provide first aid for a dog bite at home, it's very important to see a doctor, especially if an unfamiliar dog bit you, the bite is deep, you can't stop the bleeding, or there are any signs of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus). Dog bites can cause infections that need to be treated with antibiotics. To care for a dog bite injury at home: Place a clean towel over the injury to stop any bleeding. Try to keep the injured area elevated. Wash the bite carefully with soap and water. Apply a sterile bandage to the wound. Apply antibiotic ointment to the injury every day to prevent infection. When you visit the doctor, be prepared to answer a few questions, including: Do you know the owner of the dog? If so, is the dog up to date on all vaccinations, including rabies? Did the bite occur because the dog was provoked, or was the dog unprovoked? What health conditions do you have? People with diabetes, liver disease, illnesses that suppress the immune system, and other health conditions may be at greater risk for a more severe infection. Your doctor will examine the injury to see whether the bite was deep enough to damage muscles, tendons, nerves, or bones. Then the doctor will thoroughly clean the bite wound to remove any dirt or bacteria, and may also remove dead tissues from the wound. Sometimes, sutures are used to close a dog bite wound; however, this practice is controversial. Although suturing the injury can reduce scarring, it also can increase the risk of infection. Whether the injury is closed may depend on its location. For example, dog bites on the face may be sutured to prevent visible scars. Very deep wounds that cause a great deal of damage may require plastic surgery. Your doctor will also take measures to prevent infection. It's rare for dogs in the U. S. to have rabies, but if the dog's health status is unknown, or the dog tests positive for rabies, you will need to get a rabies vaccine. ( Bear in mind that the dog would have to be euthanized and their brain tested for rabies.) The doctor will also make sure that you are up to date on your tetanus shot. You may need to take antibiotics for seven to 14 days to prevent or treat an infection. The doctor may ask you to come back in one to three days to have the injury rechecked. If you did not know the dog that bit you, make sure to report the bite to your local animal control office or police.""]",['https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites'],"[""https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites\nThey may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite.

61,26,"['Most cold and flu drugs attack symptoms, not the specific viruses. They aren\'t a cure, but they can ease your symptoms or shorten your illness. There\'s no one right way to treat a cold or the flu. But here are some questions to ask your pharmacist to get the right over-the-counter medication for you. This depends on your symptoms. If you have nasal or sinus congestion, then a decongestant can be helpful. If you have drainage -- either a runny nose or postnasal drip or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine may be helpful. Over-the-counter antihistamines often make people drowsy; decongestants can make people hyper or keep them awake. Antihistamines can make secretions thick, which can be a problem for people with asthma. Keep in mind that both these medications may interact with other drugs you may be taking for conditions such as heart disease, and they may worsen some conditions. Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist which cold medication may be best for you. Decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate, and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Pseudoephedrine is the primary oral decongestant available. In general, if your blood pressure is well controlled with medications, then a decongestant shouldn\'t be a problem as long as you monitor your blood pressure. This may not be true with certain types of blood pressure drugs. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about what may be best for you. Nasal decongestants work fast to open breathing passages. But if you use them for more than three days in a row, you may suffer a ""rebound effect,"" and end up more congested than you were at the start. Some doctors suggest using a saline spray instead of a medicated spray. Saline spray works more slowly but has no rebound effect. An occasional cough may clear the lung of pollutants and excess phlegm and probably shouldn\'t be treated. However, a persistent cough should be diagnosed and treated specifically. On the shelf you\'ll find numerous cough medicines with various combinations of decongestants, antihistamines, analgesics/antipyretics, cough suppressants, and expectorants. Ask your pharmacist which combination, if any, would be right for you. Fever may be a good thing. It helps the body fight off infection by suppressing the growth of bacteria and viruses and activating the immune system. Doctors no longer recommend suppressing fever for most people, except perhaps for the very young, the very old, and those with certain medical conditions such as heart disease or lung disease. However, if you are uncomfortable, it\'s fine to take these medications. Young people (including those in their early 20s), however, should avoid aspirin. Tylenol, or other medicines with acetaminophen, and Advil, or other medicines with ibuprofen, are best. Each type of medicine has its own set of risks, so check with your doctor or pharmacist as to which type of pain reliever or fever reducer is best for you. Be careful not to overdose! These drugs are often mixed in with cough and cold and flu remedies. Read the labels and don\'t take a separate pain remedy if your cough or cold medicine includes it. If you are unsure about the ingredients, talk to your pharmacist before taking the medicine. Drinking lots of fluids and using salt water gargles (made by combining a cup of warm water and a teaspoon of salt) can often be helpful for easing the pain of a sore throat. Some oral medications (such as Tylenol) and medicated lozenges and gargles can also temporarily soothe a sore throat. Get your doctor\'s approval before using any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, and don\'t use lozenges or gargles for more than a few days. The drugs could mask signs of strep throat, a bacterial infection that should be treated with antibiotics.']",['https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/6-tips-on-cold-remedies'],"['https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/6-tips-on-cold-remedies\nMost cold and flu drugs attack symptoms, not the specific viruses.

These drugs are often mixed in with cough and cold and flu remedies. Read the labels and don\'t take a separate pain remedy if your cough or cold medicine includes it. If you are unsure about the ingredients, talk to your pharmacist before taking the medicine. Drinking lots of fluids and using salt water gargles (made by combining a cup of warm water and a teaspoon of salt) can often be helpful for easing the pain of a sore throat. Some oral medications (such as Tylenol) and medicated lozenges and gargles can also temporarily soothe a sore throat. Get your doctor\'s approval before using any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, and don\'t use lozenges or gargles for more than a few days. The drugs could mask signs of strep throat, a bacterial infection that should be treated with antibiotics.']","['https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/6-tips-on-cold-remedies\nMost cold and flu drugs attack symptoms, not the specific viruses. They aren\'t a cure, but they can ease your symptoms or shorten your illness. There\'s no one right way to treat a cold or the flu. But here are some questions to ask your pharmacist to get the right over-the-counter medication for you. This depends on your symptoms. If you have nasal or sinus congestion, then a decongestant can be helpful. If you have drainage -- either a runny nose or postnasal drip or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine may be helpful. Over-the-counter antihistamines often make people drowsy; decongestants can make people hyper or keep them awake. Antihistamines can make secretions thick, which can be a problem for people with asthma. Keep in mind that both these medications may interact with other drugs you may be taking for conditions such as heart disease, and they may worsen some conditions. Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist which cold medication may be best for you. Decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate, and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Pseudoephedrine is the primary oral decongestant available. In general, if your blood pressure is well controlled with medications, then a decongestant shouldn\'t be a problem as long as you monitor your blood pressure. This may not be true with certain types of blood pressure drugs. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about what may be best for you. \x1b[92m[1] Nasal decongestants work fast to open breathing passages\x1b[0m. But if you use them for more than three days in a row, you may suffer a ""rebound effect,"" and end up more congested than you were at the start. \x1b[92m[3] Some doctors suggest using a saline spray instead of a medicated spray\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[4] Saline spray works more slowly but has no rebound effect\x1b[0m. An occasional cough may clear the lung of pollutants and excess phlegm and probably shouldn\'t be treated. However, a persistent cough should be diagnosed and treated specifically. On the shelf you\'ll find numerous cough medicines with various combinations of decongestants, antihistamines, analgesics/antipyretics, cough suppressants, and expectorants. Ask your pharmacist which combination, if any, would be right for you. Fever may be a good thing. It helps the body fight off infection by suppressing the growth of bacteria and viruses and activating the immune system. Doctors no longer recommend suppressing fever for most people, except perhaps for the very young, the very old, and those with certain medical conditions such as heart disease or lung disease. However, if you are uncomfortable, it\'s fine to take these medications. Young people (including those in their early 20s), however, should avoid aspirin. Tylenol, or other medicines with acetaminophen, and Advil, or other medicines with ibuprofen, are best. Each type of medicine has its own set of risks, so check with your doctor or pharmacist as to which type of pain reliever or fever reducer is best for you. Be careful not to overdose!

Most people who have genital herpes don't know they're infected, so ask whether he or she has had any other sexually transmitted disease. People with a history of STDs are more likely to have genital herpes. It may be awkward, but it's important to be honest with each other. Your partner may be afraid to tell you the truth if he or she fears a negative reaction. If your partner feels comfortable talking with you, you'll be more likely to get straight answers. Someone who has had many sexual partners is more likely to be infected with the herpes virus.

If you know your partner has genital herpes, always abstain from sex when symptoms are present. Or, if you see a sore on someone's genitals, don't have sex with that person until you're sure he or she doesn't have genital herpes. Remember, not everyone with genital herpes has symptoms, and herpes sores can be very hard to spot. Oral herpes, which causes sores on the mouth (known as cold sores of fever blisters), can be passed to the genitals through oral sex. If you think your partner is at high risk for genital herpes, you may consider asking him or her to be tested. In that case, you should be tested, too.

63,32,"['The cornea is the clear layer on the front of your eye that helps focus light so you can see clearly. If it gets damaged, you might need to have it replaced. The surgeon will remove all or part of your cornea and replace it with a healthy layer of tissue. The new cornea comes from people who chose to donate this tissue when they died. A cornea transplant, also called keratoplasty, can bring back vision, lessen pain, and possible improve the appearance of your cornea if it is white and scarred. The light rays that pass through a damaged cornea can get distorted and change your vision. A corneal transplant corrects several eye problems, including: Cornea scarring because of an injury or an infection Corneal ulcers or ""sores"" from an infection A medical condition that makes your cornea bulge out (keratoconus) Thinning, clouding, or swelling of the cornea Inherited eye diseases, such as Fuchs\' dystrophy and others Problems caused by an earlier eye operation Your doctor will let you know which specific procedure is best for your condition. If the doctor does a penetrating keratoplasty ( PK), all the layers of your cornea get replaced. The surgeon sews the new cornea onto your eye with stitches thinner than hair. You might need this procedure if you have a severe cornea injury or bad bulging and scarring. It has the longest healing time. During deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( DALK), the surgeon injects air to lift off and separate the thin outside and thick middle layers of your cornea, then removes and replaces only those. People with keratoconus or a corneal scar that hasn\'t affected the inner layers may have this done. The healing time with this procedure is shorter than a full thickness transplant. Because your eye itself isn\'t opened up, it\'s unlikely the lens and iris could be damaged, and there\'s less chance of an infection inside your eye. About half of the people who need cornea transplants each year have a problem with the innermost layer of the cornea, the endothelium. Doctors often do this type of surgery to help Fuchs\' dystrophy and other medical conditions. Descemet\'s stripping endothelial keratoplasty ( DSEK or DSAEK) is the most common type of endothelial keratoplasty. The surgeon removes the endothelium -- a mere one cell thick -- and the Descemet membrane just above it. Then he replaces them with a donated endothelium and Descemet membrane still attached to the stroma (the cornea\'s thick middle layer) to help him handle the new tissue without damaging it. Another variation, Descemet\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK), transplants just the endothelium and Descemet membrane -- no supporting stroma. The donor tissue is very thin and fragile, so it\'s harder to work with, but healing from this procedure is usually quicker. A third option for selected people wth Fuch\'s dystrophy is simple removal of the central part of the inner membrane without a transplant, if the surrounding cornea seems healthy enough to provide cells to fill in the removed area. These surgeries are good options for people with cornea damage only in the inner layer because recovery is easier. Before your operation, your doctor will probably do an exam and some lab tests to check that you\'re in good general health. You may have to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin, a couple of weeks before the procedure. Usually, you\'ll have to use antibiotic drops in your eye the day before your transplant to help prevent an infection. Most of the time, these surgeries are done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia. This means you\'ll be awake but woozy, the area is numb, and you\'ll be able to go home the same day. Your doctor will do the entire surgery while looking through a microscope. It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, you\'ll probably wear an eye patch for at least a day, maybe 4, until the top layer of your cornea heals. Your eye will most likely be red and sensitive to light. It might hurt or feel sore for a few days, but some people don\'t feel any discomfort. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection. He may prescribe other medicines to help with pain. He\'ll want to check your eye the day after surgery, several times during the following couple of weeks, and then a few more times during the first year. For transplant procedures such as DSEK and DMEK that use a gas bubble inside the eye to help position the transplanted tissue, the surgeon may ask you to lie flat sometimes during the day and sleep flat on your back at night for a few days. You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures. Other things that could happen include: Infection Bleeding Higher pressure in the eye (called glaucoma) Clouding of the eye\'s lens (called cataracts) Swelling of the cornea A detached retina, when the back inside surface of your eye pulls away from its normal position Most people who have a cornea transplant get at least part of their vision restored, but each situation is different. It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round.

Before your operation, your doctor will probably do an exam and some lab tests to check that you\'re in good general health. You may have to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin, a couple of weeks before the procedure. Usually, you\'ll have to use antibiotic drops in your eye the day before your transplant to help prevent an infection. Most of the time, these surgeries are done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia. This means you\'ll be awake but woozy, the area is numb, and you\'ll be able to go home the same day. Your doctor will do the entire surgery while looking through a microscope. It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, you\'ll probably wear an eye patch for at least a day, maybe 4, until the top layer of your cornea heals. Your eye will most likely be red and sensitive to light. It might hurt or feel sore for a few days, but some people don\'t feel any discomfort. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection. \x1b[92m[2] He may prescribe other medicines to help with pain\x1b[0m. He\'ll want to check your eye the day after surgery, several times during the following couple of weeks, and then a few more times during the first year. For transplant procedures such as DSEK and DMEK that use a gas bubble inside the eye to help position the transplanted tissue, the surgeon may ask you to lie flat sometimes during the day and sleep flat on your back at night for a few days. You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. \x1b[92m[3] Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully\x1b[0m. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures. Other things that could happen include: Infection Bleeding Higher pressure in the eye (called glaucoma) Clouding of the eye\'s lens (called cataracts) Swelling of the cornea A detached retina, when the back inside surface of your eye pulls away from its normal position Most people who have a cornea transplant get at least part of their vision restored, but each situation is different. It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round. After the first year, you should see your eye doctor once or twice every year. The donated tissue usually lasts a lifetime.']",Do I need medications to recover from cornea transplant surgery?,"Following cornea transplant surgery, your physician will recommend eye drops to reduce inflammation and minimize the risk of infection.

You do need to take prediabetes seriously, but there\'s still time to turn things around -- if you start now. The goal is to get your blood sugar level out of the prediabetes range, and keep it that way. What you do every day makes a big difference. Making lifestyle changes may be even more powerful than just taking medication. That\'s what happened in a large study called the Diabetes Prevention Program: People with prediabetes who lost a small amount of weight through diet and exercise cut their odds of getting type 2 diabetes by 58%, compared to 31% for people who only took the prescription drug metformin. Start by making these three changes. If you\'re overweight, slimming down is the key to turning the odds in your favor. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. To reach your goal, limit portion sizes; cut calories; and eat fewer foods that are high in fat (especially saturated fat), sugar, and carbohydrates. You should also eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Leading an active life is a must. Aim for 30 minutes of aerobic activity (something that raises your heart rate, like walking, biking, or swimming) 5 days a week (150 minutes per week). Plus, do some strength-training exercise, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, at least twice a week. Strength work builds muscle, which helps lower your blood sugar level, helps your body respond better to insulin (which controls blood sugar), and burns calories even when you\'re not moving. Smoking is strongly linked to diabetes: People who smoke are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who don\'t. And people with diabetes who continue smoking are more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and blindness. So the sooner you ditch the cigarettes, the better. While lifestyle changes can work wonders, some people with prediabetes also need medication. Your doctor may prescribe metformin if you have certain risk factors, such as low levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol, high triglycerides (a type of blood fat), a parent or sibling with diabetes, or are overweight.

65,39,"[""A latex condom may protect you from the herpes virus if it covers the infected area. Most people who have genital herpes don't know they're infected, so ask whether he or she has had any other sexually transmitted disease. People with a history of STDs are more likely to have genital herpes. It may be awkward, but it's important to be honest with each other. Your partner may be afraid to tell you the truth if he or she fears a negative reaction. If your partner feels comfortable talking with you, you'll be more likely to get straight answers. Someone who has had many sexual partners is more likely to be infected with the herpes virus. The fewer sexual partners you have in your lifetime, the less likely you are to be exposed to the herpes virus. If you know your partner has genital herpes, always abstain from sex when symptoms are present. Or, if you see a sore on someone's genitals, don't have sex with that person until you're sure he or she doesn't have genital herpes. Remember, not everyone with genital herpes has symptoms, and herpes sores can be very hard to spot. Oral herpes, which causes sores on the mouth (known as cold sores of fever blisters), can be passed to the genitals through oral sex. If you think your partner is at high risk for genital herpes, you may consider asking him or her to be tested. In that case, you should be tested, too. Alcohol and illicit drugs lower inhibitions and impair judgment. People tend to be less careful about practicing safer sex while intoxicated and they often regret it later. The only way to be 100% certain you won't get a sexually transmitted disease is to have just one sex partner who has no STDs -- and only if both of you stay monogamous. If you don't want to be monogamous or totally celibate until you find a life partner, you could greatly reduce the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease by doing things that don't involve genital-genital contact or oral-genital contact, such as mutual masturbation.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/reduce-risk'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/reduce-risk\n\x1b[92m[1] A latex condom may protect you from the herpes virus if it covers the infected area\x1b[0m.

68,27,"[""A positron emission tomography ( PET) scan may be used to locate the part of the brain that is causing seizures. A PET scan is a test used to give doctors and their patients more information about how the cells in the body are functioning. A PET scan is done by injecting a small amount of radioactive material (known as a tracer) into a patient's vein, usually in the arm. The tracer sends out small, positively charged particles (positrons) that interact with negatively charged particles (electrons) in your body. The PET scanner is able to detect the product of this interaction and uses it to make an image. The PET scan shows the brain's use of oxygen or sugar (glucose). For patients with epilepsy, a PET scan is used to localize the part of the brain that is causing the seizure activity. However, doctors may request a PET scan for many different reasons. Aside from potential problems in the brain and spinal cord, the test can also be used to diagnose heart problems as well as certain kinds of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, colon, and prostate cancers and lymphoma. Before undergoing the PET procedure, be sure to tell your doctor of any medication -- prescription or non-prescription -- that you are taking, along with any herbal drugs or supplements you may be using. It is also very important that you tell the doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, since the PET scan can be harmful to an unborn child. As the test is about to begin, you will be asked to take off clothing that is covering the area of the body to be tested. Depending on the area of your body being tested, you may be asked to undress completely and put on a hospital gown. You will also be asked to remove any dentures, jewelry, or metal objects during the scan, because these items may affect the reading. A PET scan usually lasts 45-60 minutes. You will be asked to lie down on a flat table that is next to a scanner computer and a camera. You will then be given the tracer through an IV. After that, the PET scanner, a doughnut-shaped instrument, will move in circles around you. As this is happening, the camera will take pictures of patterns left by the tracer chemical inside your body. After the PET scan is finished, you will likely be asked to drink a lot of water or liquids during the next day in order to get rid of or flush the tracer chemical from your system. Because radiation is part of the test, there is a very small risk that cells or tissue may have received some damage following the PET procedure. However, the radiation levels from the tracer that is sent throughout the body are very low. In addition, following the scan, patients may find that their arm is a little bit sore or that they experience redness where the IV was placed in the arm. PET scans are usually more extensive and detailed than similar tests that are available. Despite this, test results can usually be given to the patient a day or two after the scan.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/pet-scan-epilepsy'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/pet-scan-epilepsy\nA positron emission tomography ( PET) scan may be used to locate the part of the brain that is causing seizures.

69,20,"['An insulinoma is a rare tumor of the pancreas. It\'s made of calls called beta islet cells, the same ones in the pancreas the make insulin and control your blood sugar. Normally, your pancreas makes more insulin when your blood sugar is high and less when your blood sugar is low. But an insulinoma constantly makes insulin, even when your blood sugar gets too low. You might hear an insulinoma called a ""neuroendocrine tumor"" because it starts in special cells in your body called neuroendocrine cells. These tumors are usually small (less than an inch), and almost all of them are not cancer. In most cases, surgery can cure them. Because insulomas make too much insulin, they can cause symptoms of low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia. You might have: Confusion Sweating Weakness Anxiety A fast heartbeat Headache Vision changes Personality changes Irritability Lack of muscle coordination Blurred vision Lethargy Seizure Hypoglycemia can be dangerous. If your blood sugar drops very low, you could faint or go into a coma. Hypoglycemia is common in people with diabetes. It often happens because they took too much of their medicine, missed a meal, or got more exercise than usual, all of which can lower blood sugar. An insulinoma can also cause hypoglycemia when you haven\'t eaten in a while, but it can happen at any time. It\'s not clear why some people get insulinomas. Women are slightly more likely to have them than men, and most people get them between ages 40 and 60. You\'re also more likely to have an insulinoma if you have certain genetic diseases, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: When tumors grow in glands that make hormones Von Hippel- Lindau syndrome: When tumors and cysts grow in many organs throughout the body Neurofibromatosis type 1 : Noncancerous tumors in the nerves and skin Tuberous sclerosis : Noncancerous tumors that grow in organs like your brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, and lungs It can be tough for doctors to diagnose an insulinoma. Its symptoms are the same as other common health problems. It may take time before your doctor can find it. You\'ll get tests like: Blood tests and suppression test. To find out if you have an insulinoma, your doctor will test your blood sugar, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during a 72-hour rest. This will confirm that: You have symptoms of low blood sugar, especially after not eating or heavy exercise Your blood sugar is actually low when you have those symptoms Your symptoms go away after your blood sugar goes up To do that, they will watch what happens to your blood sugar after you fast for a day to two. You may need to stay in the hospital during this time, and you won\'t be able to eat or drink anything except water. The doctor will test your blood to see if you have both low blood sugar and a high insulin level. Imaging test. You may also get an imaging test such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI so your doctor can see where the tumor is. The main treatment for an insulinoma is surgery to remove the tumor. Most of the time, that will cure you. The type of surgery you get depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Surgeons can usually remove just the insulinoma from the surface of the pancreas. Other times, the surgeon may need to remove part of the pancreas connected to the tumor. But this is less common. You might be able to have laparoscopic surgery to remove an insulinoma. In this operation, doctors make several smaller cuts in your body instead of one large one. They use special instruments to do the surgery. That means you\'ll have less pain as you heal, stay fewer days in the hospital, and can return to normal life more quickly. Most people won\'t need any more treatment after surgery. If your doctor thinks surgery won\'t work for you, you can try other treatments to manage low blood sugar. You might take medicine and eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. Cancerous insulinomas are rare, and they need different treatment. If your doctor can\'t remove the whole tumor, you may need to take medicine to prevent low blood sugar. You may also need chemotherapy. Depending on the type of tumor you have, another treatment option is getting a radioactive medicine called lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( Lutathera). You get this medicine through an IV. This drug attaches itself to part of the tumor cell, and the radiation from the drug damages the cell.']",['https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/what-is-insulinoma'],"['https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/what-is-insulinoma\nAn insulinoma is a rare tumor of the pancreas.

Women are slightly more likely to have them than men, and most people get them between ages 40 and 60. You\'re also more likely to have an insulinoma if you have certain genetic diseases, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: When tumors grow in glands that make hormones Von Hippel- Lindau syndrome: When tumors and cysts grow in many organs throughout the body Neurofibromatosis type 1 : Noncancerous tumors in the nerves and skin Tuberous sclerosis : Noncancerous tumors that grow in organs like your brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, and lungs It can be tough for doctors to diagnose an insulinoma. Its symptoms are the same as other common health problems. It may take time before your doctor can find it. You\'ll get tests like: Blood tests and suppression test. To find out if you have an insulinoma, your doctor will test your blood sugar, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during a 72-hour rest. This will confirm that: You have symptoms of low blood sugar, especially after not eating or heavy exercise Your blood sugar is actually low when you have those symptoms Your symptoms go away after your blood sugar goes up To do that, they will watch what happens to your blood sugar after you fast for a day to two. You may need to stay in the hospital during this time, and you won\'t be able to eat or drink anything except water. The doctor will test your blood to see if you have both low blood sugar and a high insulin level. Imaging test. You may also get an imaging test such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI so your doctor can see where the tumor is. The main treatment for an insulinoma is surgery to remove the tumor. Most of the time, that will cure you. The type of surgery you get depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor.

You might take medicine and eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. Cancerous insulinomas are rare, and they need different treatment. If your doctor can\'t remove the whole tumor, you may need to take medicine to prevent low blood sugar. You may also need chemotherapy. Depending on the type of tumor you have, another treatment option is getting a radioactive medicine called lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( Lutathera). You get this medicine through an IV. This drug attaches itself to part of the tumor cell, and the radiation from the drug damages the cell.']","['https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/what-is-insulinoma\nAn insulinoma is a rare tumor of the pancreas. It\'s made of calls called beta islet cells, the same ones in the pancreas the make insulin and control your blood sugar. Normally, your pancreas makes more insulin when your blood sugar is high and less when your blood sugar is low. But an insulinoma constantly makes insulin, even when your blood sugar gets too low. You might hear an insulinoma called a ""neuroendocrine tumor"" because it starts in special cells in your body called neuroendocrine cells. These tumors are usually small (less than an inch), and almost all of them are not cancer. In most cases, surgery can cure them. Because insulomas make too much insulin, they can cause symptoms of low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia. You might have: Confusion Sweating Weakness Anxiety A fast heartbeat Headache Vision changes Personality changes Irritability Lack of muscle coordination Blurred vision Lethargy Seizure Hypoglycemia can be dangerous. If your blood sugar drops very low, you could faint or go into a coma. Hypoglycemia is common in people with diabetes. It often happens because they took too much of their medicine, missed a meal, or got more exercise than usual, all of which can lower blood sugar.

72,31,"['Photophobia literally means ""fear of light."" If you have photophobia, you\'re not actually afraid of light, but you are very sensitive to it. The sun or bright indoor light can be uncomfortable, even painful. Photophobia isn\'t a condition -- it\'s a symptom of another problem. Migraine headaches, dry eyes, and swelling inside your eye are commonly linked to light sensitivity. It can cause pain whenever you\'re in bright sunlight or indoor light. You might want to blink or close your eyes. Some people also get headaches. Photophobia is linked to the connection between cells in your eyes that detect light and a nerve that goes to your head. Migraines are the most common cause of light sensitivity. Up to 80% of people who get them have photophobia along with their headaches. Many of those people are light sensitive even when they don\'t have a headache. Other types of headaches can cause photophobia, too. People who get tension and cluster headaches also say they\'re uncomfortable around bright light. A few brain conditions can cause photophobia, including: Meningitis (swelling of the protective coverings of your brain and spinal cord) Serious brain injury Supranuclear palsy (a brain disorder that causes problems with balance, walking, and eye movement) Tumors in your pituitary gland Some eye diseases cause this symptom, including: Dry eye Uveitis (swelling of the inside of your eye) Keratitis (swelling of your cornea, the clear layer that covers the colored part of your eye) Iritis (swelling of the colored ring around your pupil) Cataracts (cloudy coverings over the lenses of your eyes) Corneal abrasion (a scratch on your cornea) Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear tissue that sits over the white part of your eye) Damage to your retina, the light-sensitive layer in the back of your eye Blepharospasm (a condition that makes your eyelids close uncontrollably) Photophobia may also affect some people who have these mental health conditions: Agoraphobia (a fear of being in public places) Anxiety Bipolar disorder Depression Panic disorder You can also get photophobia after you have LASIK or other surgery to fix vision problems. Certain wavelengths of light -- like the blue light your computer and smartphone give off -- cause the most sensitivity. Some medicines can also cause photophobia, including: Antibiotics, such as doxycycline and tetracycline. Furosemide ( Lasix): This keeps your body from holding on to too much fluid. It\'s used to treat congestive heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, and other conditions. Quinine ( Qualaquin): This is a drug used to treat malaria. If you think you have photophobia, see your eye doctor. She\'ll ask about your symptoms and any medical conditions you have. Then she\'ll check the health of your eyes and possibly your brain. Tests your doctor might use include: Slit-lamp eye exam. She\'ll use a special microscope with a light to examine your eyes. MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of your eyes. Exam of the tear film. This checks the amount of tears you make to see if you have dry eyes. The best way to ease photophobia is to treat the condition or stop taking the medicine that\'s causing it. If you\'re still affected by it, tinted glasses may help. Some people have found relief from rose-colored lenses called FL-41. But tinted lenses aren\'t for everyone.

73,32,"['The cornea is the clear layer on the front of your eye that helps focus light so you can see clearly. If it gets damaged, you might need to have it replaced. The surgeon will remove all or part of your cornea and replace it with a healthy layer of tissue. The new cornea comes from people who chose to donate this tissue when they died. A cornea transplant, also called keratoplasty, can bring back vision, lessen pain, and possible improve the appearance of your cornea if it is white and scarred. The light rays that pass through a damaged cornea can get distorted and change your vision. A corneal transplant corrects several eye problems, including: Cornea scarring because of an injury or an infection Corneal ulcers or ""sores"" from an infection A medical condition that makes your cornea bulge out (keratoconus) Thinning, clouding, or swelling of the cornea Inherited eye diseases, such as Fuchs\' dystrophy and others Problems caused by an earlier eye operation Your doctor will let you know which specific procedure is best for your condition. If the doctor does a penetrating keratoplasty ( PK), all the layers of your cornea get replaced. The surgeon sews the new cornea onto your eye with stitches thinner than hair. You might need this procedure if you have a severe cornea injury or bad bulging and scarring. It has the longest healing time. During deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( DALK), the surgeon injects air to lift off and separate the thin outside and thick middle layers of your cornea, then removes and replaces only those. People with keratoconus or a corneal scar that hasn\'t affected the inner layers may have this done. The healing time with this procedure is shorter than a full thickness transplant. Because your eye itself isn\'t opened up, it\'s unlikely the lens and iris could be damaged, and there\'s less chance of an infection inside your eye. About half of the people who need cornea transplants each year have a problem with the innermost layer of the cornea, the endothelium. Doctors often do this type of surgery to help Fuchs\' dystrophy and other medical conditions. Descemet\'s stripping endothelial keratoplasty ( DSEK or DSAEK) is the most common type of endothelial keratoplasty. The surgeon removes the endothelium -- a mere one cell thick -- and the Descemet membrane just above it. Then he replaces them with a donated endothelium and Descemet membrane still attached to the stroma (the cornea\'s thick middle layer) to help him handle the new tissue without damaging it. Another variation, Descemet\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK), transplants just the endothelium and Descemet membrane -- no supporting stroma. The donor tissue is very thin and fragile, so it\'s harder to work with, but healing from this procedure is usually quicker. A third option for selected people wth Fuch\'s dystrophy is simple removal of the central part of the inner membrane without a transplant, if the surrounding cornea seems healthy enough to provide cells to fill in the removed area. These surgeries are good options for people with cornea damage only in the inner layer because recovery is easier. Before your operation, your doctor will probably do an exam and some lab tests to check that you\'re in good general health. You may have to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin, a couple of weeks before the procedure. Usually, you\'ll have to use antibiotic drops in your eye the day before your transplant to help prevent an infection. Most of the time, these surgeries are done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia. This means you\'ll be awake but woozy, the area is numb, and you\'ll be able to go home the same day. Your doctor will do the entire surgery while looking through a microscope. It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, you\'ll probably wear an eye patch for at least a day, maybe 4, until the top layer of your cornea heals. Your eye will most likely be red and sensitive to light. It might hurt or feel sore for a few days, but some people don\'t feel any discomfort. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection. He may prescribe other medicines to help with pain. He\'ll want to check your eye the day after surgery, several times during the following couple of weeks, and then a few more times during the first year. For transplant procedures such as DSEK and DMEK that use a gas bubble inside the eye to help position the transplanted tissue, the surgeon may ask you to lie flat sometimes during the day and sleep flat on your back at night for a few days. You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures. Other things that could happen include: Infection Bleeding Higher pressure in the eye (called glaucoma) Clouding of the eye\'s lens (called cataracts) Swelling of the cornea A detached retina, when the back inside surface of your eye pulls away from its normal position Most people who have a cornea transplant get at least part of their vision restored, but each situation is different. It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round. After the first year, you should see your eye doctor once or twice every year. The donated tissue usually lasts a lifetime.']",['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/cornea-transplant-surgery'],"['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/cornea-transplant-surgery\nThe cornea is the clear layer on the front of your eye that helps focus light so you can see clearly.

You\'ll have to protect your eye from injury after your surgery. \x1b[92m[3] Follow your doctor\'s instructions carefully\x1b[0m. Your cornea doesn\'t get any blood, so it heals slowly. If you needed stitches, your doctor will take them out at the office a few months later. A corneal transplant is considered a fairly safe procedure, but it is surgery, so there are risks. In about 1 out of every 10 transplants, the body\'s immune system attacks the donated tissue. This is called rejection. It can be reversed with eye drops most of the time. Because so little donor tissue is used for DSEK and especially DMEK, there\'s a much lower risk of rejection with these procedures. Other things that could happen include: Infection Bleeding Higher pressure in the eye (called glaucoma) Clouding of the eye\'s lens (called cataracts) Swelling of the cornea A detached retina, when the back inside surface of your eye pulls away from its normal position Most people who have a cornea transplant get at least part of their vision restored, but each situation is different. It could take a few weeks and up to a year for your vision to improve fully. Your eyesight might get a little worse before it gets better. Your glasses or contact lens prescription may need to be adjusted to include astigmatism correction because the transplanted tissue won\'t be perfectly round. After the first year, you should see your eye doctor once or twice every year. The donated tissue usually lasts a lifetime.']",Do I need medications to recover from cornea transplant surgery?,"After your cornea transplant surgery, your doctor will prescribe eye drops to bring down inflammation and lower the chances of infection.

It helps make the outer membranes of our bodies\' cells stable. But for decades, doctors have known that people with high total cholesterol levels are more likely to get heart disease. More recently, they\'ve found the different forms of cholesterol (""good"" and ""bad"") also play a role. High total cholesterol, high bad cholesterol, or low good cholesterol could raise your chances. For example, LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol can stick to blood vessel walls. Over years, it can play a role in clogging arteries in a process called atherosclerosis. Narrowed arteries in your heart can then develop sudden blood clots, causing heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends that everyone over age 20 get a cholesterol test so you know what your levels are and can do something about them if you need to. The different kinds of cholesterol and other fats in your blood are together called lipids. Doctors measure and diagnose lipid problems with a simple blood test. You\'ll probably have to fast for 9 to 12 hours before it to make sure it\'s not affected by any food you recently ate. A lipid profile usually gives results for four different types: Total cholesterol LDL (low-density lipoprotein), the ""bad cholesterol"" HDL (high-density lipoprotein), the ""good cholesterol"" Triglycerides, another form of fat Some lipid panels can give even more detailed information, like the presence and sizes of various fat particles in your blood. Researchers are looking into what, if any, effect these traits have on heart disease. There\'s no clear guidelines on when this more advanced testing is needed. So you\'ve gone hungry overnight, endured a small bloodletting, and dutifully returned to get your results. Now, what do the numbers mean? For total cholesterol: 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) or less is normal. 201 to 240 mg/d L is borderline. More than 240 mg/d L is high. For HDL (""good cholesterol""), more is better: 60 mg/d L or higher is good -- it protects against heart disease. 40 to 59 mg/d L is OK. Less than 40 mg/d L is low, raising your chance of heart disease. For LDL (""bad cholesterol""), lower is better: Less than 100 mg/d L is ideal. 100 to 129 mg/d L can be good, depending on your health. 130 to 159 mg/d L is borderline high. 160 to 189 mg/d L is high. 190 mg/d L or more is very high. Your doctor will consider your overall likelihood of heart disease to set your personal LDL goal. For people at great risk of heart disease, or who already have it, your LDL should be less than 100 mg/d L. ( Your heart doctor might recommend an even lower LDL -- less than 70 mg/d L -- if your risk of heart disease is very high.) If you have a moderately high chance, an LDL less than 130 mg/d L is your target. If you\'re not likely to get heart disease, less than 160 mg/d L is probably fine. High triglycerides (150 mg/d L or greater) also raise the odds for heart disease somewhat. Lifestyle changes are the first thing to tackle to reduce your chance of heart disease. A cholesterol-lowering diet can bring down bad cholesterol by up to 30%. A diet low in saturated fat (7% of total calories or less) and no more than 200 mg of cholesterol daily can lower LDL cholesterol. Fiber and plant sterols (found in special margarines and other foods) help, too. Regular aerobic exercise can both lower bad cholesterol ( LDL) and raise good cholesterol ( HDL). If diet and exercise don\'t lower cholesterol levels enough, you can try medications or a combination of treatments including: Statins, the most effective and commonly used cholesterol drugs Niacin Fibrates Zetia Bile acid sequestrants Your cholesterol numbers don\'t determine your destiny. Remember, other things besides cholesterol can also lead to heart disease. Diabetes, smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, exercise, and genetics are important as well. People with normal cholesterol can have heart disease; people with high cholesterol can have healthy hearts. Overall, though, more people whose cholesterol levels are off will get heart disease.

76,35,"[""Because you have diabetes, you probably check your blood sugar several times a day to stay within a healthy range. Once a day, check your feet, too. Why? Diabetes can cause poor blood flow to your feet, so small cuts or sores don't heal as well, and they can take longer to recover. If your blood sugar isn't well-controlled, you can also have poor or no feeling in your feet. You might not even realize you have a minor injury. Diabetes can also dry the skin on your feet and make your heels crack. The big risk is infection. Germs or fungus can get into small cuts or cracks. If you think you've gotten an infection, tell your doctor right away. Early treatment can prevent it from spreading. And that makes you more likely to avoid bigger problems. Some people with diabetes who get major infections even have to get surgery to remove part or all of an affected limb. So, check your feet carefully each day. Keep your skin clean and moisturized, avoid injuries, and protect your feet to prevent small cuts, corns, calluses, blisters, or injuries. Set a specific time each day to do this check. Use good light so you can spot any problems. If it's hard for you to lean over or see your foot, ask someone to help you. Look at your feet, toes, and heels for any cuts, sores, bruises, calluses, blisters, scrapes, scratches, or skin color changes. Check between your toes for cuts or fungus that might cause athlete's foot. Look at your toenails to spot any changes. Watch for dry, cracking skin on your feet, toes, and heels. Wear thick, soft socks to protect your feet as you walk. Don't use socks with seams that might rub against your skin and cause blisters. Wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes. Shoes that are too tight or too loose may lead to blisters. Don't go barefoot. You don't want to step on rocks, tacks, or small pieces of glass that could cut your feet. Wear slippers at home. Make sure the insides of your socks and shoes are clean and free from small pebbles or debris that could cut your feet. Keep your feet clean. Don't soak them for a long time. This can dry your skin. Dry your feet well after a shower or bath. Make sure you dry between your toes. After you bathe and towel your feet, moisturize your skin. Rub lotion or petroleum jelly into your skin and heels to keep them from drying and cracking. Don't put lotion or jelly between your toes, though -- this can lead to an infection. In winter, cold weather and central heating can dry out your skin. Take extra care to moisturize your feet and keep them warm. Wear socks to bed if you get cold. Don't let the corners of your toenails grow into the skin. This could cause an ingrown toenail. File your toenails with an emery board. You can also have a nail technician or your podiatrist trim and file them regularly. If you get pedicures at a nail salon, bring your own nail tools. Don't use anything sharp to clean under your toenails or to remove calluses. You don't want to accidentally get a cut that could let an infection set in. You can use a pumice stone to gently smooth your heels after taking a shower or bath. Don't rub too harshly. Exercise regularly to keep your blood flow healthy. Watch your blood sugar levels and follow your diet as your doctor directs. If you keep your blood sugar and weight under control, you may have fewer foot problems. Don't smoke. Smoking can narrow your blood vessels and raise your chance of getting foot problems. Also, note any cuts, scratches, scrapes, blisters, corns, or calluses, even if they're small. Let your doctor or podiatrist know in case you need medical treatment. Look for any redness, swelling, or drainage that could be a sign of an infection. If you think an infection is starting, get medical attention. Watch for foot sores called ulcers. They often develop on the balls of your feet or the bottoms of your toes. Tell your doctor if you think you have one. Nails that seem thicker, yellow, changed in shape, striped, or not growing normally could be a sign of an injury or infection. If your foot, ankle, or toe is swollen, red, hot to the touch, changed in shape or size, or hurts during normal movement, you may have a sprain or fracture. Call your doctor or seek medical treatment right away. Damage to your nerves, called diabetic neuropathy, can raise your chance of having a serious condition called Charcot foot, which causes a change in the shape of the foot. Call your doctor if you have minor foot problems like bunions, hammertoe, plantar warts, or athlete's foot, a fungal infection. Treat these issues before they become more serious. If you spot a wart, corn, or callus on your foot, don't try to treat it yourself with over-the-counter pads or liquids. Don't try to cut it off your skin. Ask your podiatrist or doctor to remove it safely.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/diabetes-better-foot-care'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/diabetes-better-foot-care\nBecause you have diabetes, you probably check your blood sugar several times a day to stay within a healthy range. Once a day, check your feet, too. Why? Diabetes can cause poor blood flow to your feet, so small cuts or sores don't heal as well, and they can take longer to recover. If your blood sugar isn't well-controlled, you can also have poor or no feeling in your feet. You might not even realize you have a minor injury. Diabetes can also dry the skin on your feet and make your heels crack. The big risk is infection. Germs or fungus can get into small cuts or cracks. If you think you've gotten an infection, tell your doctor right away. Early treatment can prevent it from spreading. And that makes you more likely to avoid bigger problems.

78,34,"['Newborns tend to have an irregular breathing pattern that alternates between fast and slow, with occasional pauses. If your baby makes noises when breathing, take note of what they sound like. This will help determine if there is a problem in the breathing passages and where: Whistling noise: A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths. This is a good trick, as it allows them to breathe and eat at the same time. However, their little noses have small air passages, so a little bit of mucus or dried milk can make the breathing passage even smaller, causing a whistling noise or occasionally, difficulty moving the air in and out. Hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough: A blockage in the larynx (windpipe), often due to mucus, makes a hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough. This may be a sign of croup, an infection of the larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes. High-pitched, squeaky sound: Called stridor or laryngomalacia, this is a sound very young babies make when breathing in. It is worse when a child is lying on his or her back. It is caused by excess tissue around the larynx and is typically harmless. It typically passes by the time a child reaches age 2. Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on). Fast, labored breathing: Fluid in the smallest airways (the ""alveoli"") causes pneumonia, an infection due to a virus or bacteria. Pneumonia causes fast, labored breathing, occasionally cyanosis, a persistent cough, and crackly sounds (""rales"") when listened to with a stethoscope. Watch your baby\'s breathing when she\'s well, so you can get used to how it looks. Time how many breaths she takes in a minute. It\'s probably faster than you imagined. Knowing what\'s normal for your baby\'s breathing will help you spot a potential problem more quickly. When in doubt of what\'s going on, make a video of the breathing pattern that is worrying you to show to your baby\'s health care provider. Signs of potentially worrisome breathing problems in your baby include: Persistently increased rate of breathing (greater than 60 breaths per minute or so) Increased work to breathe. Signs of this include: Grunting. The baby makes a little grunting noise at the end of respiration. This serves to try to open up blocked airways. Flaring. The baby\'s nostrils flare during breathing, showing increased effort. Retractions. The muscles in the baby\'s chest (under the ribs) and neck are visibly seen going in and out much more deeply than usual. Cyanosis. This means the blood has remained blue and has not gotten sufficient oxygen from the lungs (such as with pneumonia). For true cyanosis, the blood all over the body should look blue. Check areas that get a lot of blood flow, such as the lips and the tongue. Sometimes, the hands and feet of newborns turn bluish, but the rest of the body is fine. This is not cyanosis but a common response to changes in temperature. Poor feeding. "" Respiratory distress"" is often accompanied by a noticeable decrease in feeding intake. Lethargy. Your baby\'s energy level may be markedly decreased if she has a significant lung problem. Fever. Most infections of the lung will cause a fever, as well. Always check your baby\'s temperature when you are concerned. Breathing problems (such as noisy breathing) that only occur occasionally are normal.

79,31,"['Photophobia literally means ""fear of light."" If you have photophobia, you\'re not actually afraid of light, but you are very sensitive to it. The sun or bright indoor light can be uncomfortable, even painful. Photophobia isn\'t a condition -- it\'s a symptom of another problem. Migraine headaches, dry eyes, and swelling inside your eye are commonly linked to light sensitivity. It can cause pain whenever you\'re in bright sunlight or indoor light. You might want to blink or close your eyes. Some people also get headaches. Photophobia is linked to the connection between cells in your eyes that detect light and a nerve that goes to your head. Migraines are the most common cause of light sensitivity. Up to 80% of people who get them have photophobia along with their headaches. Many of those people are light sensitive even when they don\'t have a headache. Other types of headaches can cause photophobia, too. People who get tension and cluster headaches also say they\'re uncomfortable around bright light. A few brain conditions can cause photophobia, including: Meningitis (swelling of the protective coverings of your brain and spinal cord) Serious brain injury Supranuclear palsy (a brain disorder that causes problems with balance, walking, and eye movement) Tumors in your pituitary gland Some eye diseases cause this symptom, including: Dry eye Uveitis (swelling of the inside of your eye) Keratitis (swelling of your cornea, the clear layer that covers the colored part of your eye) Iritis (swelling of the colored ring around your pupil) Cataracts (cloudy coverings over the lenses of your eyes) Corneal abrasion (a scratch on your cornea) Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear tissue that sits over the white part of your eye) Damage to your retina, the light-sensitive layer in the back of your eye Blepharospasm (a condition that makes your eyelids close uncontrollably) Photophobia may also affect some people who have these mental health conditions: Agoraphobia (a fear of being in public places) Anxiety Bipolar disorder Depression Panic disorder You can also get photophobia after you have LASIK or other surgery to fix vision problems. Certain wavelengths of light -- like the blue light your computer and smartphone give off -- cause the most sensitivity. Some medicines can also cause photophobia, including: Antibiotics, such as doxycycline and tetracycline. Furosemide ( Lasix): This keeps your body from holding on to too much fluid. It\'s used to treat congestive heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, and other conditions. Quinine ( Qualaquin): This is a drug used to treat malaria. If you think you have photophobia, see your eye doctor. She\'ll ask about your symptoms and any medical conditions you have. Then she\'ll check the health of your eyes and possibly your brain. Tests your doctor might use include: Slit-lamp eye exam. She\'ll use a special microscope with a light to examine your eyes. MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of your eyes. Exam of the tear film. This checks the amount of tears you make to see if you have dry eyes. The best way to ease photophobia is to treat the condition or stop taking the medicine that\'s causing it. If you\'re still affected by it, tinted glasses may help. Some people have found relief from rose-colored lenses called FL-41. But tinted lenses aren\'t for everyone. They can make some people even more sensitive to light, so talk with your doctor about what\'s best for you.']",['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/photophobia-facts'],"['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/photophobia-facts\nPhotophobia literally means ""fear of light.""

If you have photophobia, you\'re not actually afraid of light, but you are very sensitive to it. The sun or bright indoor light can be uncomfortable, even painful. Photophobia isn\'t a condition -- it\'s a symptom of another problem. Migraine headaches, dry eyes, and swelling inside your eye are commonly linked to light sensitivity. It can cause pain whenever you\'re in bright sunlight or indoor light. You might want to blink or close your eyes. Some people also get headaches. Photophobia is linked to the connection between cells in your eyes that detect light and a nerve that goes to your head. Migraines are the most common cause of light sensitivity. Up to 80% of people who get them have photophobia along with their headaches. Many of those people are light sensitive even when they don\'t have a headache. Other types of headaches can cause photophobia, too. People who get tension and cluster headaches also say they\'re uncomfortable around bright light. A few brain conditions can cause photophobia, including: Meningitis (swelling of the protective coverings of your brain and spinal cord) Serious brain injury Supranuclear palsy (a brain disorder that causes problems with balance, walking, and eye movement) Tumors in your pituitary gland Some eye diseases cause this symptom, including: Dry eye Uveitis (swelling of the inside of your eye) Keratitis (swelling of your cornea, the clear layer that covers the colored part of your eye) Iritis (swelling of the colored ring around your pupil) Cataracts (cloudy coverings over the lenses of your eyes) Corneal abrasion (a scratch on your cornea) Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear tissue that sits over the white part of your eye) Damage to your retina, the light-sensitive layer in the back of your eye Blepharospasm (a condition that makes your eyelids close uncontrollably) Photophobia may also affect some people who have these mental health conditions: Agoraphobia (a fear of being in public places) Anxiety Bipolar disorder Depression Panic disorder You can also get photophobia after you have LASIK or other surgery to fix vision problems.

80,35,"[""Because you have diabetes, you probably check your blood sugar several times a day to stay within a healthy range. Once a day, check your feet, too. Why? Diabetes can cause poor blood flow to your feet, so small cuts or sores don't heal as well, and they can take longer to recover. If your blood sugar isn't well-controlled, you can also have poor or no feeling in your feet. You might not even realize you have a minor injury. Diabetes can also dry the skin on your feet and make your heels crack. The big risk is infection. Germs or fungus can get into small cuts or cracks. If you think you've gotten an infection, tell your doctor right away. Early treatment can prevent it from spreading. And that makes you more likely to avoid bigger problems. Some people with diabetes who get major infections even have to get surgery to remove part or all of an affected limb. So, check your feet carefully each day. Keep your skin clean and moisturized, avoid injuries, and protect your feet to prevent small cuts, corns, calluses, blisters, or injuries. Set a specific time each day to do this check. Use good light so you can spot any problems. If it's hard for you to lean over or see your foot, ask someone to help you. Look at your feet, toes, and heels for any cuts, sores, bruises, calluses, blisters, scrapes, scratches, or skin color changes. Check between your toes for cuts or fungus that might cause athlete's foot. Look at your toenails to spot any changes. Watch for dry, cracking skin on your feet, toes, and heels. Wear thick, soft socks to protect your feet as you walk. Don't use socks with seams that might rub against your skin and cause blisters. Wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes. Shoes that are too tight or too loose may lead to blisters. Don't go barefoot. You don't want to step on rocks, tacks, or small pieces of glass that could cut your feet. Wear slippers at home. Make sure the insides of your socks and shoes are clean and free from small pebbles or debris that could cut your feet. Keep your feet clean. Don't soak them for a long time. This can dry your skin. Dry your feet well after a shower or bath. Make sure you dry between your toes. After you bathe and towel your feet, moisturize your skin. Rub lotion or petroleum jelly into your skin and heels to keep them from drying and cracking. Don't put lotion or jelly between your toes, though -- this can lead to an infection. In winter, cold weather and central heating can dry out your skin. Take extra care to moisturize your feet and keep them warm. Wear socks to bed if you get cold. Don't let the corners of your toenails grow into the skin. This could cause an ingrown toenail. File your toenails with an emery board. You can also have a nail technician or your podiatrist trim and file them regularly. If you get pedicures at a nail salon, bring your own nail tools. Don't use anything sharp to clean under your toenails or to remove calluses. You don't want to accidentally get a cut that could let an infection set in. You can use a pumice stone to gently smooth your heels after taking a shower or bath. Don't rub too harshly. Exercise regularly to keep your blood flow healthy. Watch your blood sugar levels and follow your diet as your doctor directs. If you keep your blood sugar and weight under control, you may have fewer foot problems. Don't smoke. Smoking can narrow your blood vessels and raise your chance of getting foot problems. Also, note any cuts, scratches, scrapes, blisters, corns, or calluses, even if they're small. Let your doctor or podiatrist know in case you need medical treatment. Look for any redness, swelling, or drainage that could be a sign of an infection. If you think an infection is starting, get medical attention. Watch for foot sores called ulcers. They often develop on the balls of your feet or the bottoms of your toes. Tell your doctor if you think you have one. Nails that seem thicker, yellow, changed in shape, striped, or not growing normally could be a sign of an injury or infection. If your foot, ankle, or toe is swollen, red, hot to the touch, changed in shape or size, or hurts during normal movement, you may have a sprain or fracture. Call your doctor or seek medical treatment right away. Damage to your nerves, called diabetic neuropathy, can raise your chance of having a serious condition called Charcot foot, which causes a change in the shape of the foot. Call your doctor if you have minor foot problems like bunions, hammertoe, plantar warts, or athlete's foot, a fungal infection. Treat these issues before they become more serious. If you spot a wart, corn, or callus on your foot, don't try to treat it yourself with over-the-counter pads or liquids. Don't try to cut it off your skin. Ask your podiatrist or doctor to remove it safely.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/diabetes-better-foot-care'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/diabetes-better-foot-care\nBecause you have diabetes, you probably check your blood sugar several times a day to stay within a healthy range.

81,29,"[""Your doctor or pharmacist can help you get answers about emergency contraception. You may want to ask them: There are lots of good options. But the best one for you depends on different things. Your age, for instance -- some nonprescription products have age limits. Your insurance may pay only for a prescription. When you had sex can matter, too. Some products work for about 3 days after, some for 5. Your doctor or pharmacist can steer you in the right direction. The copper- T intrauterine device ( IUD) can work as emergency contraception. The IUD goes inside your body. If you want an IUD, a nurse or doctor needs to put it in within 5 days of when you had sex. The IUD works as both emergency contraception and as ongoing birth control. It prevents pregnancy as long as it is in place. The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception. . Ask your doctor if an IUD might be a good choice for you, especially if you already wanted long-term birth control. There are 3 types of emergency contraception in pill form that are sold both with and without a prescription. You need to be 17 to buy them if a prescription is needed. Depending on the brand and dose, you might get 1 pill or 2. 1. Pills containing a hormone called levonorgestrel: My Way (over-the-counter) Plan B One- Step (over-the-counter) Preventeza (over-the-counter) Take Action (over-the-counter) 2. Birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception, but you have to take more than one pill at a time to keep from getting pregnant. This approach works, but it is less effective and more likely to cause nausea than levonorgestrel. Birth control pills require a prescription. Talk to your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking the correct pills and dose. 3. A third kind of emergency contraception pill is called ulipristal (ella, ella One). You need a prescription to get it. Some meds and supplements -- such as the epilepsy drug Dilantin, antibiotics such as rifampicin or griseofulvin, and St. John's wort -- can stop emergency contraception pills from working normally. To be safe, tell your doctor or pharmacist about other drugs and supplements you take. Emergency birth-control pills and the IUD are safe for almost all women. But if you have medical problems and you're concerned that taking emergency contraception could be risky, talk to a doctor or pharmacist. The pills may not work as well for women who are overweight or obese. It may be awkward to discuss, but ask a pharmacist or doctor. If you're overweight, Ella may work better than Plan B One- Step and generic levonorgestrel. In general, the IUD seems to work better than pills for heavier women. You should use a regular form of birth control right away. Emergency contraception lasts only for about 24 hours and may just delay ovulation, not stop it. Make sure you're protected. Some types of emergency contraception may not be safe if you're already pregnant. Most pills won't harm your pregnancy. But you should not take Ella if you think you might be pregnant. It's not safe.

82,21,"[""A computed tomography ( CT) scan is a test your doctor might use to look for a problem inside your body, plan your surgery, or check how well a treatment is working for you. It uses powerful X-rays, a form of radiation, to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Some people worry about getting this test because radiation is known as a possible cause of cancer. Know that the chances of getting cancer from a CT scan are very low. And for many people, the test is worth the small risk of radiation exposure. It can help doctors spot dangerous health problems and check that treatment works. Your doctor will make sure that the benefits you'd get from the scan outweigh the drawbacks before she recommends it for you. CT scans use X-rays, which are a type of radiation called ionizing radiation. It can damage the DNA in your cells and raise the chance that they'll turn cancerous. These scans expose you to more radiation than other imaging tests, like X-rays and mammograms. For example, one chest CT scan delivers the amount in 100 to 200 X-rays. That might sound like a lot, but the total amount you get is still very small. It's important to know that everyone is exposed to ionizing radiation every day, just from natural radioactive material in their surroundings. In a year, the average person gets about 3 millisieverts (m Sv), the units that scientists use to measure radiation. Each CT scan delivers 1 to 10 m Sv, depending on the dose of radiation and the part of your body that's getting the test. A low-dose chest CT scan is about 1.5 m Sv. The same test at a regular dose is about 7 m Sv. The more CT scans you have, the more radiation exposure you get. But that shouldn't stop you from getting them if your doctor says you need them. What are the chances that the X-rays from a scan will end up causing a problem? It depends on your age, gender, and the part of your body that's being scanned. Overall, your odds are very low -- the chance of getting a fatal cancer from any one CT scan is about 1 in 2,000. Some organs are more sensitive to radiation than others. It tends to do more damage to cells that grow and divide quickly. The breasts, lungs, thyroid gland, and bone marrow all have fast-dividing cells, so they are more sensitive than other body parts, like the brain. The possibility of cancer is slightly higher in women than in men. It's also higher in kids, because they're growing and their cells are dividing faster than those in adults. Children also have more years ahead of them in which they could get cancer from radiation. You don't need to stop getting CT scans. But it's a good idea to make sure you need each one you get. Before you have any imaging test, ask your doctor these questions: Why do I need this scan? How will it affect my treatment? What are the risks? Could you diagnose me with a test that doesn't use radiation, like an MRI or an ultrasound? How will you protect the rest of my body during the CT scan? Your doctor should use the smallest possible dose of radiation to do the scan -- especially if you need to have several of them. Ask if the technician can shield the parts of your body that don't need the test with a lead apron. This will block the X-rays from entering those areas. Keep a record of the CT scans and other X-rays you have, so you'll know how much radiation you're getting. It will also prevent you from repeating a test you've already done. Write down: The type of scan The date you had it The dose of radiation you got The name of the facility where you had the test If you're still concerned about radiation from a CT scan, you can always get a second opinion.

83,25,"['After an organ transplant, most patients quickly feel better. They go on to enjoy a significantly improved quality of life. But they are also likely to face big health challenges. Here are some tips for managing your health after an organ transplant. After an organ transplant, you will need to take immunosuppressant (anti-rejection) drugs. These drugs help prevent your immune system from attacking (""rejecting"") the donor organ. Typically, they must be taken for the lifetime of your transplanted organ. You will take other medications to help the anti-rejection drugs do their job or control their side effects. And you may need to take medications for other health conditions. Organ rejection is a constant threat. Keeping the immune system from attacking your transplanted organ requires constant vigilance. So, it\'s likely that your transplant team will make adjustments to your anti-rejection drug regimen. After your transplant, it\'s vital that you: Keep all your doctor appointments Undergo every recommended lab test Take all your prescription drugs It\'s also important to find a good pharmacist who can help you: Understand your medications Manage your medication schedule Understand how the medicine works Learn about side effects and interactions Although rejection is a scary word, it doesn\'t necessarily mean that you will lose your donor organ. Most of the time, a rejection can be reversed if your doctor detects its early signs. The symptoms of rejection -- and the medical tests used to detect rejection -- vary by the type of your organ transplant. So, it\'s important to familiarize yourself with the earlysymptoms of rejection that are specific to your transplant. If your doctor identifies a rejection, he or she will first try to reverse it by adjusting your medications. For example, you may need to: Switch to a new drug Add another drug Take a larger or smaller dose of your medications During the first few months after an organ transplant, your transplant team will see you frequently to assess the function of your donor organ. Your doctor will help you develop good health habits to keep your body as healthy as possible. The transplant team also will urge you to: Keep all wellness checkups Monitor your blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol Get all recommended health screenings on schedule After an organ transplant, you may experience short-term medication side effects such as: Hair growth or hair loss Acne Mood swings Round face Enlarged gums Weight gain These side effects may let up as your initial high dose of medication is tapered down. You also may experience other side effects such as: Diarrhea High blood pressure High cholesterol Elevated blood sugars Infection If you notice any side effects, don\'t stop taking the drugs on your own. First, let your doctor know. He or she can adjust your prescriptions to minimize side effects without increasing your risk of organ rejection. In addition to the tests that you undergo at regular follow-up visits, you will need to do some self-monitoring at home. Among the things you\'ll need to monitor are: Weight. Weigh yourself daily at the same time, preferably in the morning. Call your doctor if you gain 2 pounds in a day or more than 5 pounds total. Temperature. Take your temperature daily. Call your doctor if your temperature is too high. Blood pressure. Check your blood pressure as recommended by your doctor. Pulse. Check your pulse daily. Call your doctor if it\'s higher than the normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. ( If you\'ve had a heart transplant, your resting heart rate may be as high as 110 to 120 beats per minute.) Blood sugar. Monitor your blood sugar if you have high blood sugar or diabetes. Anti-rejection drugs can interact with many other medications or supplements. So check with your doctor or pharmacist about safe over-the-counter products you can take. Anti-rejection drugs increase your risk of dental problems. These include: Dry mouth Mouth ulcers Enlarged gums Tumors Thrush (a yeast infection) Brush and floss your teeth each day. Also look inside your mouth and under your tongue each day. Call your dentist if you notice any changes or problems. A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. But it\'s especially important after an organ transplant. Poor lifestyle habits can increase the risk of organ rejection. Be sure to avoid unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Embrace healthy behaviors such as: A nutritious diet Exercise Stress management Your transplant dietitian will give you tips for following a healthy diet. These may include: Eat high-fiber foods such as raw fruits and vegetables. Increase calcium by eating low-fat dairy products, eating green leafy vegetables, or taking calcium supplements (if directed by your doctor). Eat less salt, processed food, and snacks. Drink plenty of water (unless you are told to limit fluids). Eat high-protein foods such as lean meat, chicken (without the skin), fish, eggs, unsalted nuts, and beans. Instead of frying your food, try baking, broiling, grilling, boiling, or steaming. After an organ transplant, most patients are advised to start their exercise program with a low-impact activity such as walking. You can then gradually increase your workout intensity with aerobic activities such as: Bicycling Jogging Swimming Resistance exercise with weights can increase strength and help prevent bone loss. Stretching exercises can increase muscle tone and flexibility. The type and amount of exercise you can do after an organ transplant will depend on your age and overall physical condition. So, it\'s important to follow the recommendations of your transplant team. Transplant patients face a wide range of health concerns after the transplant.

84,34,"['Newborns tend to have an irregular breathing pattern that alternates between fast and slow, with occasional pauses. If your baby makes noises when breathing, take note of what they sound like. This will help determine if there is a problem in the breathing passages and where: Whistling noise: A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths. This is a good trick, as it allows them to breathe and eat at the same time. However, their little noses have small air passages, so a little bit of mucus or dried milk can make the breathing passage even smaller, causing a whistling noise or occasionally, difficulty moving the air in and out. Hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough: A blockage in the larynx (windpipe), often due to mucus, makes a hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough. This may be a sign of croup, an infection of the larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes. High-pitched, squeaky sound: Called stridor or laryngomalacia, this is a sound very young babies make when breathing in. It is worse when a child is lying on his or her back. It is caused by excess tissue around the larynx and is typically harmless. It typically passes by the time a child reaches age 2. Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on). Fast, labored breathing: Fluid in the smallest airways (the ""alveoli"") causes pneumonia, an infection due to a virus or bacteria. Pneumonia causes fast, labored breathing, occasionally cyanosis, a persistent cough, and crackly sounds (""rales"") when listened to with a stethoscope. Watch your baby\'s breathing when she\'s well, so you can get used to how it looks. Time how many breaths she takes in a minute. It\'s probably faster than you imagined. Knowing what\'s normal for your baby\'s breathing will help you spot a potential problem more quickly. When in doubt of what\'s going on, make a video of the breathing pattern that is worrying you to show to your baby\'s health care provider. Signs of potentially worrisome breathing problems in your baby include: Persistently increased rate of breathing (greater than 60 breaths per minute or so) Increased work to breathe. Signs of this include: Grunting. The baby makes a little grunting noise at the end of respiration. This serves to try to open up blocked airways. Flaring. The baby\'s nostrils flare during breathing, showing increased effort. Retractions. The muscles in the baby\'s chest (under the ribs) and neck are visibly seen going in and out much more deeply than usual. Cyanosis. This means the blood has remained blue and has not gotten sufficient oxygen from the lungs (such as with pneumonia). For true cyanosis, the blood all over the body should look blue. Check areas that get a lot of blood flow, such as the lips and the tongue. Sometimes, the hands and feet of newborns turn bluish, but the rest of the body is fine. This is not cyanosis but a common response to changes in temperature. Poor feeding. "" Respiratory distress"" is often accompanied by a noticeable decrease in feeding intake. Lethargy. Your baby\'s energy level may be markedly decreased if she has a significant lung problem. Fever. Most infections of the lung will cause a fever, as well. Always check your baby\'s temperature when you are concerned. Breathing problems (such as noisy breathing) that only occur occasionally are normal. Worrisome breathing problems, on the other hand, are usually persistent. However, when it comes to any breathing concerns, be sure to contact your pediatrician.']",['https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/your-newborn-babys-breathing-noises'],"['https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/your-newborn-babys-breathing-noises\nNewborns tend to have an irregular breathing pattern that alternates between fast and slow, with occasional pauses.

Signs of this include: \x1b[92m[3] Grunting\x1b[0m. The baby makes a little grunting noise at the end of respiration. This serves to try to open up blocked airways. \x1b[92m[4] Flaring\x1b[0m. The baby\'s nostrils flare during breathing, showing increased effort. \x1b[92m[5] Retractions\x1b[0m. The muscles in the baby\'s chest (under the ribs) and neck are visibly seen going in and out much more deeply than usual. Cyanosis. This means the blood has remained blue and has not gotten sufficient oxygen from the lungs (such as with pneumonia). For true \x1b[92m[6] cyanosis\x1b[0m, the blood all over the body should look blue. Check areas that get a lot of blood flow, such as the lips and the tongue. Sometimes, the hands and feet of newborns turn bluish, but the rest of the body is fine.

If your baby makes noises when breathing, take note of what they sound like. This will help determine if there is a problem in the breathing passages and where: Whistling noise: A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths. This is a good trick, as it allows them to breathe and eat at the same time. However, their little noses have small air passages, so a little bit of mucus or dried milk can make the breathing passage even smaller, causing a whistling noise or occasionally, difficulty moving the air in and out. Hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough: A blockage in the larynx (windpipe), often due to mucus, makes a hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough. This may be a sign of croup, an infection of the larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes. High-pitched, squeaky sound: Called stridor or laryngomalacia, this is a sound very young babies make when breathing in. It is worse when a child is lying on his or her back. It is caused by excess tissue around the larynx and is typically harmless. It typically passes by the time a child reaches age 2. Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on). Fast, labored breathing: Fluid in the smallest airways (the ""alveoli"") causes pneumonia, an infection due to a virus or bacteria. Pneumonia causes fast, labored breathing, occasionally \x1b[92m[6] cyanosis\x1b[0m, a persistent cough, and crackly sounds (""rales"") when listened to with a stethoscope. Watch your baby\'s breathing when she\'s well, so you can get used to how it looks. Time how many breaths she takes in a minute. It\'s probably faster than you imagined. Knowing what\'s normal for your baby\'s breathing will help you spot a potential problem more quickly.

85,26,"['Most cold and flu drugs attack symptoms, not the specific viruses. They aren\'t a cure, but they can ease your symptoms or shorten your illness. There\'s no one right way to treat a cold or the flu. But here are some questions to ask your pharmacist to get the right over-the-counter medication for you. This depends on your symptoms. If you have nasal or sinus congestion, then a decongestant can be helpful. If you have drainage -- either a runny nose or postnasal drip or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine may be helpful. Over-the-counter antihistamines often make people drowsy; decongestants can make people hyper or keep them awake. Antihistamines can make secretions thick, which can be a problem for people with asthma. Keep in mind that both these medications may interact with other drugs you may be taking for conditions such as heart disease, and they may worsen some conditions. Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist which cold medication may be best for you. Decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate, and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Pseudoephedrine is the primary oral decongestant available. In general, if your blood pressure is well controlled with medications, then a decongestant shouldn\'t be a problem as long as you monitor your blood pressure. This may not be true with certain types of blood pressure drugs. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about what may be best for you. Nasal decongestants work fast to open breathing passages. But if you use them for more than three days in a row, you may suffer a ""rebound effect,"" and end up more congested than you were at the start. Some doctors suggest using a saline spray instead of a medicated spray. Saline spray works more slowly but has no rebound effect. An occasional cough may clear the lung of pollutants and excess phlegm and probably shouldn\'t be treated. However, a persistent cough should be diagnosed and treated specifically. On the shelf you\'ll find numerous cough medicines with various combinations of decongestants, antihistamines, analgesics/antipyretics, cough suppressants, and expectorants. Ask your pharmacist which combination, if any, would be right for you. Fever may be a good thing. It helps the body fight off infection by suppressing the growth of bacteria and viruses and activating the immune system. Doctors no longer recommend suppressing fever for most people, except perhaps for the very young, the very old, and those with certain medical conditions such as heart disease or lung disease. However, if you are uncomfortable, it\'s fine to take these medications. Young people (including those in their early 20s), however, should avoid aspirin. Tylenol, or other medicines with acetaminophen, and Advil, or other medicines with ibuprofen, are best. Each type of medicine has its own set of risks, so check with your doctor or pharmacist as to which type of pain reliever or fever reducer is best for you. Be careful not to overdose! These drugs are often mixed in with cough and cold and flu remedies. Read the labels and don\'t take a separate pain remedy if your cough or cold medicine includes it. If you are unsure about the ingredients, talk to your pharmacist before taking the medicine. Drinking lots of fluids and using salt water gargles (made by combining a cup of warm water and a teaspoon of salt) can often be helpful for easing the pain of a sore throat. Some oral medications (such as Tylenol) and medicated lozenges and gargles can also temporarily soothe a sore throat. Get your doctor\'s approval before using any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, and don\'t use lozenges or gargles for more than a few days.

86,25,"['After an organ transplant, most patients quickly feel better. They go on to enjoy a significantly improved quality of life. But they are also likely to face big health challenges. Here are some tips for managing your health after an organ transplant. After an organ transplant, you will need to take immunosuppressant (anti-rejection) drugs. These drugs help prevent your immune system from attacking (""rejecting"") the donor organ. Typically, they must be taken for the lifetime of your transplanted organ. You will take other medications to help the anti-rejection drugs do their job or control their side effects. And you may need to take medications for other health conditions. Organ rejection is a constant threat. Keeping the immune system from attacking your transplanted organ requires constant vigilance. So, it\'s likely that your transplant team will make adjustments to your anti-rejection drug regimen. After your transplant, it\'s vital that you: Keep all your doctor appointments Undergo every recommended lab test Take all your prescription drugs It\'s also important to find a good pharmacist who can help you: Understand your medications Manage your medication schedule Understand how the medicine works Learn about side effects and interactions Although rejection is a scary word, it doesn\'t necessarily mean that you will lose your donor organ. Most of the time, a rejection can be reversed if your doctor detects its early signs. The symptoms of rejection -- and the medical tests used to detect rejection -- vary by the type of your organ transplant. So, it\'s important to familiarize yourself with the earlysymptoms of rejection that are specific to your transplant. If your doctor identifies a rejection, he or she will first try to reverse it by adjusting your medications. For example, you may need to: Switch to a new drug Add another drug Take a larger or smaller dose of your medications During the first few months after an organ transplant, your transplant team will see you frequently to assess the function of your donor organ. Your doctor will help you develop good health habits to keep your body as healthy as possible. The transplant team also will urge you to: Keep all wellness checkups Monitor your blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol Get all recommended health screenings on schedule After an organ transplant, you may experience short-term medication side effects such as: Hair growth or hair loss Acne Mood swings Round face Enlarged gums Weight gain These side effects may let up as your initial high dose of medication is tapered down. You also may experience other side effects such as: Diarrhea High blood pressure High cholesterol Elevated blood sugars Infection If you notice any side effects, don\'t stop taking the drugs on your own. First, let your doctor know. He or she can adjust your prescriptions to minimize side effects without increasing your risk of organ rejection. In addition to the tests that you undergo at regular follow-up visits, you will need to do some self-monitoring at home. Among the things you\'ll need to monitor are: Weight. Weigh yourself daily at the same time, preferably in the morning. Call your doctor if you gain 2 pounds in a day or more than 5 pounds total. Temperature. Take your temperature daily. Call your doctor if your temperature is too high. Blood pressure. Check your blood pressure as recommended by your doctor. Pulse. Check your pulse daily. Call your doctor if it\'s higher than the normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. ( If you\'ve had a heart transplant, your resting heart rate may be as high as 110 to 120 beats per minute.) Blood sugar. Monitor your blood sugar if you have high blood sugar or diabetes. Anti-rejection drugs can interact with many other medications or supplements. So check with your doctor or pharmacist about safe over-the-counter products you can take. Anti-rejection drugs increase your risk of dental problems. These include: Dry mouth Mouth ulcers Enlarged gums Tumors Thrush (a yeast infection) Brush and floss your teeth each day. Also look inside your mouth and under your tongue each day. Call your dentist if you notice any changes or problems. A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. But it\'s especially important after an organ transplant. Poor lifestyle habits can increase the risk of organ rejection. Be sure to avoid unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Embrace healthy behaviors such as: A nutritious diet Exercise Stress management Your transplant dietitian will give you tips for following a healthy diet. These may include: Eat high-fiber foods such as raw fruits and vegetables. Increase calcium by eating low-fat dairy products, eating green leafy vegetables, or taking calcium supplements (if directed by your doctor). Eat less salt, processed food, and snacks. Drink plenty of water (unless you are told to limit fluids). Eat high-protein foods such as lean meat, chicken (without the skin), fish, eggs, unsalted nuts, and beans. Instead of frying your food, try baking, broiling, grilling, boiling, or steaming. After an organ transplant, most patients are advised to start their exercise program with a low-impact activity such as walking. You can then gradually increase your workout intensity with aerobic activities such as: Bicycling Jogging Swimming Resistance exercise with weights can increase strength and help prevent bone loss. Stretching exercises can increase muscle tone and flexibility. The type and amount of exercise you can do after an organ transplant will depend on your age and overall physical condition. So, it\'s important to follow the recommendations of your transplant team. Transplant patients face a wide range of health concerns after the transplant. It\'s not uncommon for these health challenges to lead to stress. Getting proper rest and exercise can help.']",['https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/organ-transplant-after-the-transplant'],"['https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/organ-transplant-after-the-transplant\nAfter an organ transplant, most patients quickly feel better.

They go on to enjoy a significantly improved quality of life. But they are also likely to face big health challenges. Here are some tips for managing your health after an organ transplant. After an organ transplant, you will need to take immunosuppressant (anti-rejection) drugs. These drugs help prevent your immune system from attacking (""rejecting"") the donor organ. Typically, they must be taken for the lifetime of your transplanted organ. You will take other medications to help the anti-rejection drugs do their job or control their side effects. And you may need to take medications for other health conditions. Organ rejection is a constant threat. Keeping the immune system from attacking your transplanted organ requires constant vigilance. So, it\'s likely that your transplant team will make adjustments to your anti-rejection drug regimen. After your transplant, it\'s vital that you: \x1b[92m[1] Keep all your doctor appointments\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[2] Undergo every recommended lab test\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[3] Take all your prescription drugs\x1b[0m It\'s also important to find a good pharmacist who can help you: Understand your medications Manage your medication schedule Understand how the medicine works Learn about side effects and interactions Although rejection is a scary word, it doesn\'t necessarily mean that you will lose your donor organ. Most of the time, a rejection can be reversed if your doctor detects its early signs. The symptoms of rejection -- and the medical tests used to detect rejection -- vary by the type of your organ transplant. So, it\'s important to familiarize yourself with the earlysymptoms of rejection that are specific to your transplant. If your doctor identifies a rejection, he or she will first try to reverse it by adjusting your medications. For example, you may need to: Switch to a new drug Add another drug Take a larger or smaller dose of your medications During the first few months after an organ transplant, your transplant team will see you frequently to assess the function of your donor organ. Your doctor will help you develop good health habits to keep your body as healthy as possible. The transplant team also will urge you to: Keep all wellness checkups Monitor your blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol Get all recommended health screenings on schedule After an organ transplant, you may experience short-term medication side effects such as: Hair growth or hair loss Acne Mood swings Round face Enlarged gums Weight gain These side effects may let up as your initial high dose of medication is tapered down. You also may experience other side effects such as: Diarrhea High blood pressure High cholesterol Elevated blood sugars Infection If you notice any side effects, don\'t stop taking the drugs on your own. First, let your doctor know. He or she can adjust your prescriptions to minimize side effects without increasing your risk of organ rejection. In addition to the tests that you undergo at regular follow-up visits, you will need to do some self-monitoring at home. Among the things you\'ll need to monitor are: Weight. Weigh yourself daily at the same time, preferably in the morning. Call your doctor if you gain 2 pounds in a day or more than 5 pounds total. Temperature. Take your temperature daily. Call your doctor if your temperature is too high. Blood pressure. Check your blood pressure as recommended by your doctor. Pulse. Check your pulse daily. Call your doctor if it\'s higher than the normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. ( If you\'ve had a heart transplant, your resting heart rate may be as high as 110 to 120 beats per minute.) Blood sugar. Monitor your blood sugar if you have high blood sugar or diabetes. Anti-rejection drugs can interact with many other medications or supplements. So check with your doctor or pharmacist about safe over-the-counter products you can take. Anti-rejection drugs increase your risk of dental problems. These include: Dry mouth Mouth ulcers Enlarged gums Tumors Thrush (a yeast infection) Brush and floss your teeth each day. Also look inside your mouth and under your tongue each day. Call your dentist if you notice any changes or problems. A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. But it\'s especially important after an organ transplant. Poor lifestyle habits can increase the risk of organ rejection. Be sure to avoid unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Embrace healthy behaviors such as: \x1b[92m[4] A nutritious diet\x1b[0m Exercise Stress management Your transplant dietitian will give you tips for following a healthy diet. These may include: \x1b[92m[5] Eat high-fiber foods such as raw fruits and vegetables\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[6] Increase calcium by eating low-fat dairy products, eating green leafy vegetables, or taking calcium supplements (if directed by your doctor)\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[7] Eat less salt, processed food, and snacks\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[8] Drink plenty of water (unless you are told to limit fluids)\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[9] Eat high-protein foods such as lean meat, chicken (without the skin), fish, eggs, unsalted nuts, and beans\x1b[0m.

87,21,"[""A computed tomography ( CT) scan is a test your doctor might use to look for a problem inside your body, plan your surgery, or check how well a treatment is working for you. It uses powerful X-rays, a form of radiation, to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Some people worry about getting this test because radiation is known as a possible cause of cancer. Know that the chances of getting cancer from a CT scan are very low. And for many people, the test is worth the small risk of radiation exposure. It can help doctors spot dangerous health problems and check that treatment works. Your doctor will make sure that the benefits you'd get from the scan outweigh the drawbacks before she recommends it for you. CT scans use X-rays, which are a type of radiation called ionizing radiation. It can damage the DNA in your cells and raise the chance that they'll turn cancerous. These scans expose you to more radiation than other imaging tests, like X-rays and mammograms. For example, one chest CT scan delivers the amount in 100 to 200 X-rays. That might sound like a lot, but the total amount you get is still very small. It's important to know that everyone is exposed to ionizing radiation every day, just from natural radioactive material in their surroundings. In a year, the average person gets about 3 millisieverts (m Sv), the units that scientists use to measure radiation. Each CT scan delivers 1 to 10 m Sv, depending on the dose of radiation and the part of your body that's getting the test. A low-dose chest CT scan is about 1.5 m Sv. The same test at a regular dose is about 7 m Sv. The more CT scans you have, the more radiation exposure you get. But that shouldn't stop you from getting them if your doctor says you need them. What are the chances that the X-rays from a scan will end up causing a problem? It depends on your age, gender, and the part of your body that's being scanned. Overall, your odds are very low -- the chance of getting a fatal cancer from any one CT scan is about 1 in 2,000. Some organs are more sensitive to radiation than others. It tends to do more damage to cells that grow and divide quickly. The breasts, lungs, thyroid gland, and bone marrow all have fast-dividing cells, so they are more sensitive than other body parts, like the brain. The possibility of cancer is slightly higher in women than in men. It's also higher in kids, because they're growing and their cells are dividing faster than those in adults. Children also have more years ahead of them in which they could get cancer from radiation. You don't need to stop getting CT scans. But it's a good idea to make sure you need each one you get. Before you have any imaging test, ask your doctor these questions: Why do I need this scan? How will it affect my treatment? What are the risks? Could you diagnose me with a test that doesn't use radiation, like an MRI or an ultrasound? How will you protect the rest of my body during the CT scan? Your doctor should use the smallest possible dose of radiation to do the scan -- especially if you need to have several of them. Ask if the technician can shield the parts of your body that don't need the test with a lead apron. This will block the X-rays from entering those areas. Keep a record of the CT scans and other X-rays you have, so you'll know how much radiation you're getting. It will also prevent you from repeating a test you've already done.

The breasts, lungs, thyroid gland, and bone marrow all have fast-dividing cells, so they are more sensitive than other body parts, like the brain. The possibility of cancer is slightly higher in women than in men. It's also higher in kids, because they're growing and their cells are dividing faster than those in adults. Children also have more years ahead of them in which they could get cancer from radiation. You don't need to stop getting CT scans. But it's a good idea to make sure you need each one you get. Before you have any imaging test, ask your doctor these questions: \x1b[92m Why do I need this scan?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m How will it affect my treatment?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m What are the risks?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m Could you diagnose me with a test that doesn't use radiation, like an MRI or an ultrasound?\x1b[0m \x1b[92m How will you protect the rest of my body during the CT scan?\x1b[0m Your doctor should use \x1b[92m the smallest possible dose of radiation\x1b[0m to do the scan -- especially if you need to have several of them. Ask if \x1b[92m the technician can shield the parts of your body that don't need the test with a lead apron\x1b[0m. This \x1b[92m will block the X-rays from entering those areas\x1b[0m. Keep a record of the CT scans and other X-rays you have, so you'll know how much radiation you're getting. It will also prevent you from repeating a test you've already done. Write down: The type of scan The date you had it The dose of radiation you got The name of the facility where you had the test If you're still concerned about radiation from a CT scan, you can always get a second opinion. Another doctor might be able to recommend other testing options.""]",,,,,,,,,Snippet
88,35,"[""Because you have diabetes, you probably check your blood sugar several times a day to stay within a healthy range. Once a day, check your feet, too. Why? Diabetes can cause poor blood flow to your feet, so small cuts or sores don't heal as well, and they can take longer to recover. If your blood sugar isn't well-controlled, you can also have poor or no feeling in your feet. You might not even realize you have a minor injury. Diabetes can also dry the skin on your feet and make your heels crack. The big risk is infection. Germs or fungus can get into small cuts or cracks. If you think you've gotten an infection, tell your doctor right away. Early treatment can prevent it from spreading. And that makes you more likely to avoid bigger problems. Some people with diabetes who get major infections even have to get surgery to remove part or all of an affected limb. So, check your feet carefully each day. Keep your skin clean and moisturized, avoid injuries, and protect your feet to prevent small cuts, corns, calluses, blisters, or injuries. Set a specific time each day to do this check. Use good light so you can spot any problems. If it's hard for you to lean over or see your foot, ask someone to help you. Look at your feet, toes, and heels for any cuts, sores, bruises, calluses, blisters, scrapes, scratches, or skin color changes. Check between your toes for cuts or fungus that might cause athlete's foot. Look at your toenails to spot any changes. Watch for dry, cracking skin on your feet, toes, and heels. Wear thick, soft socks to protect your feet as you walk. Don't use socks with seams that might rub against your skin and cause blisters. Wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes. Shoes that are too tight or too loose may lead to blisters. Don't go barefoot. You don't want to step on rocks, tacks, or small pieces of glass that could cut your feet. Wear slippers at home. Make sure the insides of your socks and shoes are clean and free from small pebbles or debris that could cut your feet. Keep your feet clean. Don't soak them for a long time. This can dry your skin. Dry your feet well after a shower or bath. Make sure you dry between your toes. After you bathe and towel your feet, moisturize your skin. Rub lotion or petroleum jelly into your skin and heels to keep them from drying and cracking. Don't put lotion or jelly between your toes, though -- this can lead to an infection. In winter, cold weather and central heating can dry out your skin. Take extra care to moisturize your feet and keep them warm. Wear socks to bed if you get cold. Don't let the corners of your toenails grow into the skin. This could cause an ingrown toenail. File your toenails with an emery board. You can also have a nail technician or your podiatrist trim and file them regularly. If you get pedicures at a nail salon, bring your own nail tools. Don't use anything sharp to clean under your toenails or to remove calluses. You don't want to accidentally get a cut that could let an infection set in. You can use a pumice stone to gently smooth your heels after taking a shower or bath. Don't rub too harshly. Exercise regularly to keep your blood flow healthy. Watch your blood sugar levels and follow your diet as your doctor directs. If you keep your blood sugar and weight under control, you may have fewer foot problems. Don't smoke. Smoking can narrow your blood vessels and raise your chance of getting foot problems. Also, note any cuts, scratches, scrapes, blisters, corns, or calluses, even if they're small. Let your doctor or podiatrist know in case you need medical treatment. Look for any redness, swelling, or drainage that could be a sign of an infection. If you think an infection is starting, get medical attention. Watch for foot sores called ulcers. They often develop on the balls of your feet or the bottoms of your toes. Tell your doctor if you think you have one. Nails that seem thicker, yellow, changed in shape, striped, or not growing normally could be a sign of an injury or infection. If your foot, ankle, or toe is swollen, red, hot to the touch, changed in shape or size, or hurts during normal movement, you may have a sprain or fracture. Call your doctor or seek medical treatment right away. Damage to your nerves, called diabetic neuropathy, can raise your chance of having a serious condition called Charcot foot, which causes a change in the shape of the foot. Call your doctor if you have minor foot problems like bunions, hammertoe, plantar warts, or athlete's foot, a fungal infection. Treat these issues before they become more serious. If you spot a wart, corn, or callus on your foot, don't try to treat it yourself with over-the-counter pads or liquids. Don't try to cut it off your skin. Ask your podiatrist or doctor to remove it safely.""]",['https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/diabetes-better-foot-care'],"[""https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/diabetes-better-foot-care\nBecause you have diabetes, you probably check your blood sugar several times a day to stay within a healthy range.

90,36,"[""Radiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan.

There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you're struggling with fatigue. She might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you're feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. \x1b[92m Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Don't scrub or rub your skin\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin\x1b[0m. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. \x1b[92m Stay out of the sun as much as possible\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to\x1b[0m. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. And you'll still need to protect yourself from the sun even after radiation therapy has ended. Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it's usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. But it's important to keep eating a healthy diet while you're having treatment to keep your body strong. Try eating five or six small meals spread out through the day instead of three large ones. Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. She can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. She'll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn't try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don't go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated. Talk with your doctor about the potential risk and how it compares to the benefits you'll get from radiation therapy.""]",,,,,,,,,Snippet
91,25,"['After an organ transplant, most patients quickly feel better. They go on to enjoy a significantly improved quality of life. But they are also likely to face big health challenges. Here are some tips for managing your health after an organ transplant. After an organ transplant, you will need to take immunosuppressant (anti-rejection) drugs. These drugs help prevent your immune system from attacking (""rejecting"") the donor organ. Typically, they must be taken for the lifetime of your transplanted organ. You will take other medications to help the anti-rejection drugs do their job or control their side effects. And you may need to take medications for other health conditions. Organ rejection is a constant threat. Keeping the immune system from attacking your transplanted organ requires constant vigilance. So, it\'s likely that your transplant team will make adjustments to your anti-rejection drug regimen. After your transplant, it\'s vital that you: Keep all your doctor appointments Undergo every recommended lab test Take all your prescription drugs It\'s also important to find a good pharmacist who can help you: Understand your medications Manage your medication schedule Understand how the medicine works Learn about side effects and interactions Although rejection is a scary word, it doesn\'t necessarily mean that you will lose your donor organ. Most of the time, a rejection can be reversed if your doctor detects its early signs. The symptoms of rejection -- and the medical tests used to detect rejection -- vary by the type of your organ transplant. So, it\'s important to familiarize yourself with the earlysymptoms of rejection that are specific to your transplant. If your doctor identifies a rejection, he or she will first try to reverse it by adjusting your medications. For example, you may need to: Switch to a new drug Add another drug Take a larger or smaller dose of your medications During the first few months after an organ transplant, your transplant team will see you frequently to assess the function of your donor organ. Your doctor will help you develop good health habits to keep your body as healthy as possible. The transplant team also will urge you to: Keep all wellness checkups Monitor your blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol Get all recommended health screenings on schedule After an organ transplant, you may experience short-term medication side effects such as: Hair growth or hair loss Acne Mood swings Round face Enlarged gums Weight gain These side effects may let up as your initial high dose of medication is tapered down. You also may experience other side effects such as: Diarrhea High blood pressure High cholesterol Elevated blood sugars Infection If you notice any side effects, don\'t stop taking the drugs on your own. First, let your doctor know. He or she can adjust your prescriptions to minimize side effects without increasing your risk of organ rejection. In addition to the tests that you undergo at regular follow-up visits, you will need to do some self-monitoring at home. Among the things you\'ll need to monitor are: Weight. Weigh yourself daily at the same time, preferably in the morning. Call your doctor if you gain 2 pounds in a day or more than 5 pounds total. Temperature. Take your temperature daily. Call your doctor if your temperature is too high. Blood pressure. Check your blood pressure as recommended by your doctor. Pulse. Check your pulse daily. Call your doctor if it\'s higher than the normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. ( If you\'ve had a heart transplant, your resting heart rate may be as high as 110 to 120 beats per minute.) Blood sugar. Monitor your blood sugar if you have high blood sugar or diabetes. Anti-rejection drugs can interact with many other medications or supplements. So check with your doctor or pharmacist about safe over-the-counter products you can take. Anti-rejection drugs increase your risk of dental problems. These include: Dry mouth Mouth ulcers Enlarged gums Tumors Thrush (a yeast infection) Brush and floss your teeth each day. Also look inside your mouth and under your tongue each day. Call your dentist if you notice any changes or problems. A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. But it\'s especially important after an organ transplant. Poor lifestyle habits can increase the risk of organ rejection. Be sure to avoid unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Embrace healthy behaviors such as: A nutritious diet Exercise Stress management Your transplant dietitian will give you tips for following a healthy diet. These may include: Eat high-fiber foods such as raw fruits and vegetables. Increase calcium by eating low-fat dairy products, eating green leafy vegetables, or taking calcium supplements (if directed by your doctor). Eat less salt, processed food, and snacks. Drink plenty of water (unless you are told to limit fluids). Eat high-protein foods such as lean meat, chicken (without the skin), fish, eggs, unsalted nuts, and beans. Instead of frying your food, try baking, broiling, grilling, boiling, or steaming. After an organ transplant, most patients are advised to start their exercise program with a low-impact activity such as walking. You can then gradually increase your workout intensity with aerobic activities such as: Bicycling Jogging Swimming Resistance exercise with weights can increase strength and help prevent bone loss. Stretching exercises can increase muscle tone and flexibility. The type and amount of exercise you can do after an organ transplant will depend on your age and overall physical condition. So, it\'s important to follow the recommendations of your transplant team. Transplant patients face a wide range of health concerns after the transplant.

Organ rejection is a constant threat. Keeping the immune system from attacking your transplanted organ requires constant vigilance. So, it\'s likely that your transplant team will make adjustments to your anti-rejection drug regimen. After your transplant, it\'s vital that you: Keep all your doctor appointments Undergo every recommended lab test Take all your prescription drugs It\'s also important to find a good pharmacist who can help you: Understand your medications Manage your medication schedule Understand how the medicine works Learn about side effects and interactions Although rejection is a scary word, it doesn\'t necessarily mean that you will lose your donor organ. Most of the time, a rejection can be reversed if your doctor detects its early signs. The symptoms of rejection -- and the medical tests used to detect rejection -- vary by the type of your organ transplant. So, it\'s important to familiarize yourself with the earlysymptoms of rejection that are specific to your transplant. If your doctor identifies a rejection, he or she will first try to reverse it by adjusting your medications. For example, you may need to: Switch to a new drug Add another drug Take a larger or smaller dose of your medications During the first few months after an organ transplant, your transplant team will see you frequently to assess the function of your donor organ. Your doctor will help you develop good health habits to keep your body as healthy as possible. The transplant team also will urge you to: Keep all wellness checkups Monitor your blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol Get all recommended health screenings on schedule After an organ transplant, you may experience short-term medication side effects such as: Hair growth or hair loss Acne Mood swings Round face Enlarged gums Weight gain These side effects may let up as your initial high dose of medication is tapered down. You also may experience other side effects such as: Diarrhea High blood pressure High cholesterol Elevated blood sugars Infection If you notice any side effects, don\'t stop taking the drugs on your own. First, let your doctor know. He or she can adjust your prescriptions to minimize side effects without increasing your risk of organ rejection. In addition to the tests that you undergo at regular follow-up visits, you will need to do some self-monitoring at home. Among the things you\'ll need to monitor are: Weight. Weigh yourself daily at the same time, preferably in the morning. Call your doctor if you gain 2 pounds in a day or more than 5 pounds total. Temperature. Take your temperature daily. Call your doctor if your temperature is too high. Blood pressure. Check your blood pressure as recommended by your doctor. Pulse. Check your pulse daily. Call your doctor if it\'s higher than the normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. ( If you\'ve had a heart transplant, your resting heart rate may be as high as 110 to 120 beats per minute.) Blood sugar. Monitor your blood sugar if you have high blood sugar or diabetes. Anti-rejection drugs can interact with many other medications or supplements. So check with your doctor or pharmacist about safe over-the-counter products you can take. Anti-rejection drugs increase your risk of dental problems. These include: Dry mouth Mouth ulcers Enlarged gums Tumors Thrush (a yeast infection) Brush and floss your teeth each day. Also look inside your mouth and under your tongue each day. Call your dentist if you notice any changes or problems. A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. But it\'s especially important after an organ transplant. Poor lifestyle habits can increase the risk of organ rejection. Be sure to avoid unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive drinking. Embrace healthy behaviors such as: A nutritious diet Exercise Stress management Your transplant dietitian will give you tips for following a healthy diet. These may include: Eat high-fiber foods such as raw fruits and vegetables. Increase calcium by eating low-fat dairy products, eating green leafy vegetables, or taking calcium supplements (if directed by your doctor). Eat less salt, processed food, and snacks. Drink plenty of water (unless you are told to limit fluids). Eat high-protein foods such as lean meat, chicken (without the skin), fish, eggs, unsalted nuts, and beans. Instead of frying your food, try baking, broiling, grilling, boiling, or steaming. After an organ transplant, most patients are advised to start their exercise program with a low-impact activity such as walking. You can then gradually increase your workout intensity with aerobic activities such as: Bicycling Jogging Swimming Resistance exercise with weights can increase strength and help prevent bone loss. Stretching exercises can increase muscle tone and flexibility. The type and amount of exercise you can do after an organ transplant will depend on your age and overall physical condition. So, it\'s important to follow the recommendations of your transplant team. Transplant patients face a wide range of health concerns after the transplant. It\'s not uncommon for these health challenges to lead to stress.

93,22,"[""They may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite. In fact, dogs bite about 4.7 million Americans every year, half of them children between ages 5 and 9. One out of every five of those bites causes an injury that requires medical attention, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Children are also more likely than adults to be injured by a dog bite. Although strays or other strange dogs can bite, most of the time people are actually bitten by a dog they know, which could be a friend's dog or even the family pet. To prevent dog bites: When choosing a dog for a family pet, pick one with a good temperament. Stay away from any dogs you don't know. Never leave young children alone with a dog -- especially an unfamiliar one. Don't try to play with any dog that is eating or feeding her puppies. Whenever you approach a dog, do so slowly,and give the dog the chance to approach you. If a dog becomes aggressive, do not run away or scream. Stay calm, move slowly, and don't make eye contact with the dog. Although you can provide first aid for a dog bite at home, it's very important to see a doctor, especially if an unfamiliar dog bit you, the bite is deep, you can't stop the bleeding, or there are any signs of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus). Dog bites can cause infections that need to be treated with antibiotics. To care for a dog bite injury at home: Place a clean towel over the injury to stop any bleeding. Try to keep the injured area elevated. Wash the bite carefully with soap and water. Apply a sterile bandage to the wound. Apply antibiotic ointment to the injury every day to prevent infection. When you visit the doctor, be prepared to answer a few questions, including: Do you know the owner of the dog? If so, is the dog up to date on all vaccinations, including rabies? Did the bite occur because the dog was provoked, or was the dog unprovoked? What health conditions do you have? People with diabetes, liver disease, illnesses that suppress the immune system, and other health conditions may be at greater risk for a more severe infection. Your doctor will examine the injury to see whether the bite was deep enough to damage muscles, tendons, nerves, or bones. Then the doctor will thoroughly clean the bite wound to remove any dirt or bacteria, and may also remove dead tissues from the wound. Sometimes, sutures are used to close a dog bite wound; however, this practice is controversial. Although suturing the injury can reduce scarring, it also can increase the risk of infection. Whether the injury is closed may depend on its location. For example, dog bites on the face may be sutured to prevent visible scars. Very deep wounds that cause a great deal of damage may require plastic surgery. Your doctor will also take measures to prevent infection. It's rare for dogs in the U. S. to have rabies, but if the dog's health status is unknown, or the dog tests positive for rabies, you will need to get a rabies vaccine. ( Bear in mind that the dog would have to be euthanized and their brain tested for rabies.) The doctor will also make sure that you are up to date on your tetanus shot. You may need to take antibiotics for seven to 14 days to prevent or treat an infection. The doctor may ask you to come back in one to three days to have the injury rechecked. If you did not know the dog that bit you, make sure to report the bite to your local animal control office or police.""]",['https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites'],"[""https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-bites\nThey may be our best friends, but dogs are still animals and they can bite.

94,38,"['Bipolar disorder was formerly called manic depression. It is a form of major affective disorder, or mood disorder, defined by manic or hypomanic episodes (changes from one\'s normal mood accompanied by high energy states). Bipolar disorder is a serious condition. Mania often involves sleeplessness, sometimes for days, along with hallucinations, psychosis, grandiose delusions, or paranoid rage. In addition, depressive episodes can be more devastating and harder to treat than in people who never have manias or hypomanias. Bipolar disorder is a complex disorder that likely stems from a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. The mood episodes associated with it involve clinical depression or mania (extreme elation and high energy) with periods of normal mood and energy in between episodes. The severity of mood episodes can range from very mild to extreme, and they can happen gradually or suddenly within a timeframe of days to weeks. When discrete mood episodes happen four or more times per year, the process is called rapid cycling. Rapid cycling should not be confused with very frequent moment-to-moment changes in mood, which can sometimes occur in people with bipolar disorder or other conditions such as borderline personality disorder. Along with manic or depressive episodes, patients with bipolar disorder may have disturbances in thinking. They may also have distortions of perception and impairment in social functioning. Like with other mood disorders, the causes of bipolar disorder are not known. What is known is that bipolar disorder involves dysregulation of brain functioning and sometimes has a genetic component (it can run in families). Bipolar disorder usually appears between ages 15 and 24 and persists through a lifetime. It\'s rare that newly diagnosed mania is seen in young children or in adults over age 65. Severity of symptoms varies with individuals who have bipolar disorder. While some people have a few symptoms, others have many that impair their ability to work and live a normal life. Marked by relapses and remissions, bipolar disorder has a high rate of recurrence if untreated. Patients with severe mania usually require hospitalization to keep them from risky behaviors. Those who are severely depressed also might need hospitalization to keep them from acting on suicidal thoughts or psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking). About 90% of individuals with bipolar I disorder, which is the more serious form, have at least one psychiatric hospitalization. Two out of three will have two or more hospitalizations in their lifetime. The clinical depression symptoms seen with bipolar disorder are the same as those seen in major depressive disorder and include: Decreased appetite and/or weight loss, or overeating and weight gain Difficulty concentrating, remembering, and making decisions Fatigue, decreased energy, being ""slowed down"" Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including sex Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain Persistently sad, anxious, or ""empty"" moods Restlessness, irritability Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts The signs of mania in bipolar disorder include: Disconnected and very fast (racing) thoughts Grandiose beliefs Inappropriate elation or euphoria Inappropriate irritability Inappropriate social behavior Increased sexual desire Increased talking speed or volume Markedly increased energy Poor judgment A decreased need for sleep due to high energy While mania is the main characteristic of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II has milder periods of elation known as hypomania. It also has episodes of major depression. According to the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, the difference between mania and hypomania is ""the degree of severity"" as well as an absence of psychosis (delusions or hallucinations) in hypomania and no negative impact from ""high"" symptoms in work and social functioning. Signs of hypomania in bipolar II disorder include: Decreased need for sleep Extreme focus on projects at work or at home Exuberant and elated mood Increased confidence Increased creativity and productivity Increased energy and libido Reckless behaviors Risky pleasure-seeking behaviors As with most mood disorders, there is no laboratory test or brain imaging method to diagnose bipolar disorder. After performing a physical exam, your doctor will evaluate your signs and symptoms. Your doctor will also ask you about your personal medical history and family history. Lab tests may be done to rule out other medical illnesses that can affect mood. In addition, your doctor may want to talk with family members to see if they can identify times when you were elated and over-energized. Because elation may feel good or even normal when compared to depression, it\'s often hard for a person with bipolar disorder to know if the mood was too high. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase. So early diagnosis and effective treatment is very important with bipolar disorder. Treatment for bipolar disorder may include the use of mood stabilizers such as lithium. Certain anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines may also be used to stabilize mood. Sometimes antidepressants are given in combination with mood stabilizers to boost the depressed mood, although antidepressants are often not as effective as some mood stabilizers or certain atypical antipsychotics for treating depression in bipolar disorder.']",['https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression'],"['https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression\nBipolar disorder was formerly called manic depression.

Sometimes antidepressants are given in combination with mood stabilizers to boost the depressed mood, although antidepressants are often not as effective as some mood stabilizers or certain atypical antipsychotics for treating depression in bipolar disorder.']",,,,,,,,,Snippet
95,38,"['Bipolar disorder was formerly called manic depression. It is a form of major affective disorder, or mood disorder, defined by manic or hypomanic episodes (changes from one\'s normal mood accompanied by high energy states). Bipolar disorder is a serious condition. Mania often involves sleeplessness, sometimes for days, along with hallucinations, psychosis, grandiose delusions, or paranoid rage. In addition, depressive episodes can be more devastating and harder to treat than in people who never have manias or hypomanias. Bipolar disorder is a complex disorder that likely stems from a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. The mood episodes associated with it involve clinical depression or mania (extreme elation and high energy) with periods of normal mood and energy in between episodes. The severity of mood episodes can range from very mild to extreme, and they can happen gradually or suddenly within a timeframe of days to weeks. When discrete mood episodes happen four or more times per year, the process is called rapid cycling. Rapid cycling should not be confused with very frequent moment-to-moment changes in mood, which can sometimes occur in people with bipolar disorder or other conditions such as borderline personality disorder. Along with manic or depressive episodes, patients with bipolar disorder may have disturbances in thinking. They may also have distortions of perception and impairment in social functioning. Like with other mood disorders, the causes of bipolar disorder are not known. What is known is that bipolar disorder involves dysregulation of brain functioning and sometimes has a genetic component (it can run in families). Bipolar disorder usually appears between ages 15 and 24 and persists through a lifetime. It\'s rare that newly diagnosed mania is seen in young children or in adults over age 65. Severity of symptoms varies with individuals who have bipolar disorder. While some people have a few symptoms, others have many that impair their ability to work and live a normal life. Marked by relapses and remissions, bipolar disorder has a high rate of recurrence if untreated. Patients with severe mania usually require hospitalization to keep them from risky behaviors. Those who are severely depressed also might need hospitalization to keep them from acting on suicidal thoughts or psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking). About 90% of individuals with bipolar I disorder, which is the more serious form, have at least one psychiatric hospitalization. Two out of three will have two or more hospitalizations in their lifetime. The clinical depression symptoms seen with bipolar disorder are the same as those seen in major depressive disorder and include: Decreased appetite and/or weight loss, or overeating and weight gain Difficulty concentrating, remembering, and making decisions Fatigue, decreased energy, being ""slowed down"" Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including sex Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain Persistently sad, anxious, or ""empty"" moods Restlessness, irritability Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts The signs of mania in bipolar disorder include: Disconnected and very fast (racing) thoughts Grandiose beliefs Inappropriate elation or euphoria Inappropriate irritability Inappropriate social behavior Increased sexual desire Increased talking speed or volume Markedly increased energy Poor judgment A decreased need for sleep due to high energy While mania is the main characteristic of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II has milder periods of elation known as hypomania. It also has episodes of major depression. According to the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, the difference between mania and hypomania is ""the degree of severity"" as well as an absence of psychosis (delusions or hallucinations) in hypomania and no negative impact from ""high"" symptoms in work and social functioning. Signs of hypomania in bipolar II disorder include: Decreased need for sleep Extreme focus on projects at work or at home Exuberant and elated mood Increased confidence Increased creativity and productivity Increased energy and libido Reckless behaviors Risky pleasure-seeking behaviors As with most mood disorders, there is no laboratory test or brain imaging method to diagnose bipolar disorder. After performing a physical exam, your doctor will evaluate your signs and symptoms. Your doctor will also ask you about your personal medical history and family history. Lab tests may be done to rule out other medical illnesses that can affect mood. In addition, your doctor may want to talk with family members to see if they can identify times when you were elated and over-energized. Because elation may feel good or even normal when compared to depression, it\'s often hard for a person with bipolar disorder to know if the mood was too high. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase. So early diagnosis and effective treatment is very important with bipolar disorder. Treatment for bipolar disorder may include the use of mood stabilizers such as lithium. Certain anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines may also be used to stabilize mood.

96,26,"['Most cold and flu drugs attack symptoms, not the specific viruses. They aren\'t a cure, but they can ease your symptoms or shorten your illness. There\'s no one right way to treat a cold or the flu. But here are some questions to ask your pharmacist to get the right over-the-counter medication for you. This depends on your symptoms. If you have nasal or sinus congestion, then a decongestant can be helpful. If you have drainage -- either a runny nose or postnasal drip or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine may be helpful. Over-the-counter antihistamines often make people drowsy; decongestants can make people hyper or keep them awake. Antihistamines can make secretions thick, which can be a problem for people with asthma. Keep in mind that both these medications may interact with other drugs you may be taking for conditions such as heart disease, and they may worsen some conditions. Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist which cold medication may be best for you. Decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate, and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Pseudoephedrine is the primary oral decongestant available. In general, if your blood pressure is well controlled with medications, then a decongestant shouldn\'t be a problem as long as you monitor your blood pressure. This may not be true with certain types of blood pressure drugs. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about what may be best for you. Nasal decongestants work fast to open breathing passages. But if you use them for more than three days in a row, you may suffer a ""rebound effect,"" and end up more congested than you were at the start. Some doctors suggest using a saline spray instead of a medicated spray. Saline spray works more slowly but has no rebound effect. An occasional cough may clear the lung of pollutants and excess phlegm and probably shouldn\'t be treated. However, a persistent cough should be diagnosed and treated specifically. On the shelf you\'ll find numerous cough medicines with various combinations of decongestants, antihistamines, analgesics/antipyretics, cough suppressants, and expectorants. Ask your pharmacist which combination, if any, would be right for you. Fever may be a good thing. It helps the body fight off infection by suppressing the growth of bacteria and viruses and activating the immune system. Doctors no longer recommend suppressing fever for most people, except perhaps for the very young, the very old, and those with certain medical conditions such as heart disease or lung disease. However, if you are uncomfortable, it\'s fine to take these medications. Young people (including those in their early 20s), however, should avoid aspirin. Tylenol, or other medicines with acetaminophen, and Advil, or other medicines with ibuprofen, are best. Each type of medicine has its own set of risks, so check with your doctor or pharmacist as to which type of pain reliever or fever reducer is best for you. Be careful not to overdose! These drugs are often mixed in with cough and cold and flu remedies. Read the labels and don\'t take a separate pain remedy if your cough or cold medicine includes it. If you are unsure about the ingredients, talk to your pharmacist before taking the medicine. Drinking lots of fluids and using salt water gargles (made by combining a cup of warm water and a teaspoon of salt) can often be helpful for easing the pain of a sore throat. Some oral medications (such as Tylenol) and medicated lozenges and gargles can also temporarily soothe a sore throat. Get your doctor\'s approval before using any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, and don\'t use lozenges or gargles for more than a few days.

Normally, your pancreas makes more insulin when your blood sugar is high and less when your blood sugar is low. But an insulinoma constantly makes insulin, even when your blood sugar gets too low. You might hear an insulinoma called a ""neuroendocrine tumor"" because it starts in special cells in your body called neuroendocrine cells. These tumors are usually small (less than an inch), and almost all of them are not cancer. In most cases, surgery can cure them. Because insulomas make too much insulin, they can cause symptoms of low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia. You might have: Confusion Sweating Weakness Anxiety A fast heartbeat Headache Vision changes Personality changes Irritability Lack of muscle coordination Blurred vision Lethargy Seizure Hypoglycemia can be dangerous. If your blood sugar drops very low, you could faint or go into a coma. Hypoglycemia is common in people with diabetes. It often happens because they took too much of their medicine, missed a meal, or got more exercise than usual, all of which can lower blood sugar. An insulinoma can also cause hypoglycemia when you haven\'t eaten in a while, but it can happen at any time. It\'s not clear why some people get insulinomas. Women are slightly more likely to have them than men, and most people get them between ages 40 and 60. You\'re also more likely to have an insulinoma if you have certain genetic diseases, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: When tumors grow in glands that make hormones Von Hippel- Lindau syndrome: When tumors and cysts grow in many organs throughout the body Neurofibromatosis type 1 : Noncancerous tumors in the nerves and skin Tuberous sclerosis : Noncancerous tumors that grow in organs like your brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, and lungs It can be tough for doctors to diagnose an insulinoma. Its symptoms are the same as other common health problems. It may take time before your doctor can find it. You\'ll get tests like: Blood tests and suppression test. To find out if you have an insulinoma, your doctor will test your blood sugar, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during a 72-hour rest. This will confirm that: You have symptoms of low blood sugar, especially after not eating or heavy exercise Your blood sugar is actually low when you have those symptoms Your symptoms go away after your blood sugar goes up To do that, they will watch what happens to your blood sugar after you fast for a day to two. You may need to stay in the hospital during this time, and you won\'t be able to eat or drink anything except water. The doctor will test your blood to see if you have both low blood sugar and a high insulin level. Imaging test. You may also get an imaging test such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI so your doctor can see where the tumor is. The main treatment for an insulinoma is surgery to remove the tumor. Most of the time, that will cure you. The type of surgery you get depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Surgeons can usually remove just the insulinoma from the surface of the pancreas. Other times, the surgeon may need to remove part of the pancreas connected to the tumor. But this is less common. You might be able to have laparoscopic surgery to remove an insulinoma. In this operation, doctors make several smaller cuts in your body instead of one large one. They use special instruments to do the surgery. That means you\'ll have less pain as you heal, stay fewer days in the hospital, and can return to normal life more quickly. Most people won\'t need any more treatment after surgery. If your doctor thinks surgery won\'t work for you, you can try other treatments to manage low blood sugar. You might take medicine and eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. Cancerous insulinomas are rare, and they need different treatment. If your doctor can\'t remove the whole tumor, you may need to take medicine to prevent low blood sugar. You may also need chemotherapy. Depending on the type of tumor you have, another treatment option is getting a radioactive medicine called lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( Lutathera). You get this medicine through an IV.

99,31,"['Photophobia literally means ""fear of light."" If you have photophobia, you\'re not actually afraid of light, but you are very sensitive to it. The sun or bright indoor light can be uncomfortable, even painful. Photophobia isn\'t a condition -- it\'s a symptom of another problem. Migraine headaches, dry eyes, and swelling inside your eye are commonly linked to light sensitivity. It can cause pain whenever you\'re in bright sunlight or indoor light. You might want to blink or close your eyes. Some people also get headaches. Photophobia is linked to the connection between cells in your eyes that detect light and a nerve that goes to your head. Migraines are the most common cause of light sensitivity. Up to 80% of people who get them have photophobia along with their headaches. Many of those people are light sensitive even when they don\'t have a headache. Other types of headaches can cause photophobia, too. People who get tension and cluster headaches also say they\'re uncomfortable around bright light. A few brain conditions can cause photophobia, including: Meningitis (swelling of the protective coverings of your brain and spinal cord) Serious brain injury Supranuclear palsy (a brain disorder that causes problems with balance, walking, and eye movement) Tumors in your pituitary gland Some eye diseases cause this symptom, including: Dry eye Uveitis (swelling of the inside of your eye) Keratitis (swelling of your cornea, the clear layer that covers the colored part of your eye) Iritis (swelling of the colored ring around your pupil) Cataracts (cloudy coverings over the lenses of your eyes) Corneal abrasion (a scratch on your cornea) Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear tissue that sits over the white part of your eye) Damage to your retina, the light-sensitive layer in the back of your eye Blepharospasm (a condition that makes your eyelids close uncontrollably) Photophobia may also affect some people who have these mental health conditions: Agoraphobia (a fear of being in public places) Anxiety Bipolar disorder Depression Panic disorder You can also get photophobia after you have LASIK or other surgery to fix vision problems. Certain wavelengths of light -- like the blue light your computer and smartphone give off -- cause the most sensitivity. Some medicines can also cause photophobia, including: Antibiotics, such as doxycycline and tetracycline. Furosemide ( Lasix): This keeps your body from holding on to too much fluid. It\'s used to treat congestive heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, and other conditions. Quinine ( Qualaquin): This is a drug used to treat malaria. If you think you have photophobia, see your eye doctor. She\'ll ask about your symptoms and any medical conditions you have. Then she\'ll check the health of your eyes and possibly your brain. Tests your doctor might use include: Slit-lamp eye exam. She\'ll use a special microscope with a light to examine your eyes. MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of your eyes. Exam of the tear film. This checks the amount of tears you make to see if you have dry eyes. The best way to ease photophobia is to treat the condition or stop taking the medicine that\'s causing it. If you\'re still affected by it, tinted glasses may help. Some people have found relief from rose-colored lenses called FL-41. But tinted lenses aren\'t for everyone. They can make some people even more sensitive to light, so talk with your doctor about what\'s best for you.']",['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/photophobia-facts'],"['https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/photophobia-facts\nPhotophobia literally means ""fear of light.""
