34,14,25,"[""Schwab, in an understatement, acknowledged that: 'Evolutionary controversy surrounds the eye' such as 'did the eye evolve just once, or many times?' The reason evolutionists argue that the eye must have evolved many times is because 'the fundamental differences between the basic photoreceptive cells of invertebrates and vertebrates' are so great that the eye must have 'evolved more than once' (Schwab 2012, 24). The multiple evolution claim is driven by the fact that one eye type evolving into another type cannot be bridged even by made-up 'just-so' stories (Bergman 2008). \x1b[92m[0] Evolutionists admit that 'the evolution of animal eyes is a story of a stunning rise in complexity, from a very simple common evolutionary precursor, the hypothetical ‘proto-eye’—a simple organ composed of two functionally distinct cells, a light-sensitive photoreceptor cell (PRC) and a shading pigment cell (SPC)—to something as intricate as the human eye or the cephalopod eye' (Arendt, Hausen, and Purschke 2009, 2809).\x1b[0m Explaining how this could, or did, happen has proven very difficult.\n"", ""The stigma (2) of the euglena hides a light-sensitive spot.\nThe earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called 'eyespots'. \x1b[92m[1] Eyespots can sense only ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms.\x1b[0m\nThey are insufficient for vision, as they cannot distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from. Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups, and are common among unicellular organisms, including euglena. The euglena's eyespot, called a stigma, is located at its anterior end.\nIt is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals. Together with the leading flagellum, the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light, often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis, and to predict day and night, the primary function of circadian rhythms.\n"", ""But it is the animals, with our image-forming eyes, that have taken light detection to the next level.96% of animal species have eyes. \x1b[92m[2] The first animal eyes did little but detect light—they helped to establish day/night\ncycles and coordinate behavior—but more-complex eyes soon evolved.\x1b[0m A predator who can see its prey from a distance, or a\nprey animal that can see the shadow of a predator approaching, has a clear survival advantage over those who can't. Even a\nslight improvement in image quality provides a significant survival advantage, allowing for the step-by-step evolution of\nincreasingly complex eyes. By synchronizing their reproductive cycles with the sun and the moon, some species of coral manage to spawn\nduring a single hour of the year.\nLight detection may have first evolved to set up rhythms and routines for feeding,\n""]",Explain to a third-grader: what is the first step in the evolution of the eye,"The first step in the evolution of the eye was when tiny creatures developed simple light-sensitive spots [92m[0][0m.

Every treasure hunter at the table agrees with the decision.\nThe episode ends at Borehole 10-X, where the Oak Island crew- along with Dan Henskee, a former Oak Island treasure hunter and sometime resident- watch as contractors prepare to airlift the water from the shaft.\n\x1b[92m[0] Analysis\nEquipment Malfunctions on Oak Island\nIn this episode of The Curse of Oak Island,\xa0the men of Oak Island Tours Inc.\x1b[0m experienced something very strange. Professional diver Mike Huntley, while exploring the cavern at the bottom of Borehole C1 with a hand-held metal detector, got a succession of hits on his metal detector indicating the presence of up to three metallic objects embedded in the walls of the cavity. However, when professional diver John Chatterton\xa0attempted to replicate Huntley’s hits, the mysterious metallic objects were nowhere to be found.\n', 'In Season 6, Episode 12, while attempting to conduct a sonar scan of Shaft H8 in the Money Pit area, the ROV used to conduct the scan suddenly and inexplicably malfunctioned.\nIn Season 6, Episode 15, while attempting to pump water into Borehole C1 as part of a dye test, the hose though which the water is being pumped is found to be twisted. The crew shuts off the pump and bleeds the pressure from the hose before untwisting the kink and resuming the operation, narrowly avoiding a potentially dangerous blowout.\nTerry Deveau and the Overton Stone\nIn this episode, historian Terry J. Deveau led Rick Lagina and Charles Barkhouse to a large stone which he claimed was a carved Mi’kmaq monolith depicting the Mi’kmaq deity Glooscap. \x1b[92m[1] This is not Deveau’s first Oak Island experience; the historian and rock expert has appeared on The Curse of Oak Island several times before, perhaps most notably in Season 3, Episode 4, in which he introduced the Oak Island team to the Overton Stone.\x1b[0m\n', ""Deveau leads Rick and Charles to a large rock in the wilderness which’s shape is vaguely suggestive of a human head. Rick notes that there are several small, rounds stones lying beneath the larger one- somewhat evocative of the mysterious, dolmen-like, Neolithic-esque megaliths scattered throughout the Canadian Maritimes- and suggests that they maybe have been placed there by man so that the stone could be oriented in a particular direction. Deveau suggests that ancient Mi’kmaq sculptors made 'some modifications to [the stone’s] outline to make the facial features more prominent.' \x1b[92m[6] And Barkhouse notes that the late Oak Island treasure hunter Fred Nolan, years ago, discovered a large head-shaped stone buried beneath the centre of Nolan’s Cross (an array of five conical boulders on Oak Island which form a perfect cross), implying that there might be some sort of connection between this Peggy’s Cove stone and Oak Island.\x1b[0m\nAn interpretation of the Peggy’s Cove stone.\n"", '\x1b[92m[5] In his 2017 documentary Seven Steps to Mercy, Norwegian organist, amateur cryptographer, and documentarian Petter Amundsen attempted to access\xa0his ‘Mercy Point’ in the Oak Island swamp (which he introduced in Season 1, Episode 3 of The Curse of Oak Island) when the swamp was pumped dry.\x1b[0m Strangely, the navigational implements he used to locate the Mercy Point- specifically a smartphone\xa0compass and an old fashioned magnetic compass, which both operate on magnetism- acted erratically the closer he got to the Mercy Point.\nIn Season 4, Episode 11 of The Curse of Oak Island\xa0(the following episode), contractor Jeremy Frizzell attempted to construct an inflatable cofferdam around a section of Smith’s Cove. The cofferdam inexplicably ruptured before completion, and the project was abandoned.\nIn Season 5, Episode 4, a hose on a drilling rig burst, blasting the hardhat off driller Max Williamson. Although Williamson suffered a broken wrist and a contusion on his leg, he was otherwise unharmed.\n']",Explain to a third-grader: where is the tv show the curse of oak island filmed,"The TV show ""The Curse of Oak Island"" is filmed on a special island called Oak Island, which is located in Nova Scotia, Canada [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m.

Tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer. Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Gallbladder cancer is a rare type of cancer that starts in the tissues of the gallbladder.Gallbladder cancer occurs when cells in the gallbladder start to grow out of control. \x1b[92m[1] The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[9] The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver to digest fat.\x1b[0m When food is being broken down in the stomach and intestines, bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine. EnlargeAnatomy of the gallbladder. \x1b[92m[4] The gallbladder is just below the liver.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[16] Bile is stored in the gallbladder and flows through the cystic duct and the common bile duct into the small intestine when food is being digested.\x1b[0m The wall of the gallbladder\n', ""\x1b[92m[14] The gallbladder's main function is to store bile, a fluid that helps with digestion.\x1b[0m This muscular organ also concentrates and releases bile into the digestive system. When bile is needed, the gallbladder contracts, forcing the fluid through a tube called the cystic duct.\n\x1b[92m[2] The gallbladder is located just below the liver on the right side of the body.\x1b[0m Bile, which is also known as 'gall,' is produced in the liver and passed into the gallbladder for storage. This is where the gallbladder gets its name.\nGallbladder Function\nThere are several important functions of the gallbladder, which include:\nTo store and concentrate bile\nTo respond to intestinal hormones (such as cholecystokinin) to empty and refill its bile stores\nTo contribute to regulating the composition of bile (the percentage of water, bile salts and more)\nTo control the flow of bile into the small intestine\nTo contract, secreting bile into the biliary tract and duodenum (the first section of the small intestine)\nWhat Is Bile?\n"", 'Usually, the pancreas secretes just enough bicarbonate to counterbalance the amount of HCl produced in the stomach. Hydrogen ions enter the blood when bicarbonate is secreted by the pancreas. Thus, the acidic blood draining from the pancreas neutralizes the alkaline blood draining from the stomach, maintaining the pH of the venous blood that flows to the liver.\n\x1b[92m[7] The Gallbladder\nThe gallbladder is 8–10 cm (~3–4 in) long and is nested in a shallow area on the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver.\x1b[0m This muscular sac stores, concentrates, and, when stimulated, propels the bile into the duodenum via the common bile duct. It is divided into three regions. The fundus is the widest portion and tapers medially into the body, which in turn narrows to become the neck. The neck angles slightly superiorly as it approaches the hepatic duct. The cystic duct is 1–2 cm (less than 1 in) long and turns inferiorly as it bridges the neck and hepatic duct.\n', '\x1b[92m[11] The gallbladder plays many important roles in digestive health and function, including storing and concentrating bile.\x1b[0m Within the gallbladder, water, electrolytes, lipids, and proteins are absorbed from the bile. This absorption allows for a five- to 20-time increase in bile bilirubin and bile salt concentrations. The gallbladder also acidifies bile through epithelial acid secretions and adds mucin to bile by bile acid stimulation of the mucosa.\nGALLBLADDER PHYSIOLOGY\nBile\nBile is required for the successful digestion and absorption of nutrients. It aids in fat digestion and absorption by emulsifying large fat particles into smaller ones that are more susceptible to pancreatic lipase. Bile also enhances intestinal absorption of digested fats and aids in the excretion of waste products, including cholesterol and bilirubin.\n', ""\x1b[92m[12] The liver makes bile, which helps the body absorb fat.\x1b[0m It’s located in the top right of the belly.\nThe gallbladder stores bile until it is needed. It’s hidden just below the liver.\nThe pancreas makes enzymes that help digest proteins, fats, and carbs. It’s found below the stomach.\nEnzymes and bile travel through small pathways (called ducts) into the small intestine, where they help to break down food.\nUndigested food and some water travels to the large intestine through a muscular ring called the ileocecal (ill-ee-oh-SEE-kul) valve. This valve prevents food from returning to the small intestine. By the time food reaches the large intestine, the work of absorbing nutrients is nearly finished.\nThe large intestine: The large intestine's main job is to remove water from the undigested matter and form solid waste (poop) to be excreted. The large intestine includes three parts:\n"", ""which emulsifies and aids the breakdown of dietary fat. \x1b[92m[0] The gallbladder, a small hollow pouch that sits just under the right lobe of liver, stores and concentrates the bile produced by the liver, which is later excreted to the duodenum to help with digestion.\x1b[0m The liver's highly specialized tissue, consisting mostly of hepatocytes, regulates a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex organic molecules, many of which are necessary for normal vital functions. Estimates regarding the organ's total number of functions vary, but is generally cited as being around 500. For this reason, the liver has sometimes been described as the body's chemical factory.\n"", 'The liver is a dark reddish brown, wedge-shaped organ with two lobes of unequal size and shape. A human liver normally weighs approximately 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) and has a width of about 15 centimetres (6 inches). There is considerable size variation between individuals, with the standard reference range for men being 970–1,860 grams (2.14–4.10\xa0lb) and for women 600–1,770\xa0g (1.32–3.90\xa0lb). It is both the heaviest internal organ and the largest gland in the human body. \x1b[92m[3] It is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity, resting just below the diaphragm, to the right of the stomach, and overlying the gallbladder.\x1b[0m\n', '\x1b[92m[5] The gallbladder is a small sac that holds bile, a digestive juice produced by the liver that is used in the breakdown of dietary fats.\x1b[0m The gallbladder extracts water from its store of bile until the liquid becomes highly concentrated. The presence of fatty foods triggers the gallbladder to squeeze its bile concentrate into the small intestine. About gallstones Gallstones (biliary calculi) are small stones made from cholesterol, bile pigment and calcium salts, usually in a mixture that forms in the gallbladder. They are a common disorder of the digestive system, and affect around 15% of people aged 50 years and over.\nSome things that may cause gallstones to form include the crystallisation of excess cholesterol in bile and the failure of the gallbladder to empty completely.\nIn most cases, gallstones don’t cause any problems. However, you might need prompt treatment if stones block ducts and cause complications such as infections or inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).\n', ""The simple columnar epithelium of the gallbladder mucosa is organized in rugae, similar to those of the stomach. There is no submucosa in the gallbladder wall. The wall’s middle, muscular coat is made of smooth muscle fibers. When these fibers contract, the gallbladder’s contents are ejected through the cystic duct and into the bile duct (Figure 23.27). Visceral peritoneum reflected from the liver capsule holds the gallbladder against the liver and forms the outer coat of the gallbladder. The gallbladder's mucosa absorbs water and ions from bile, concentrating it by up to 10-fold.\n\x1b[92m[15] Figure\n23.27\nGallbladder\nThe gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, and releases it into the two-way cystic duct when it is needed by the small intestine.\x1b[0m\nPreviousNextOrder a print copyCitation/Attribution\nThis book may not be used in the training of large language models or otherwise be ingested into large language models or generative AI offerings without OpenStax's permission.\n"", 'When gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it’s known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis. \x1b[92m[6] Read more about:\nsymptoms of gallstones\ncomplications of gallstones\nThe gallbladder\nThe gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ found underneath the liver.\x1b[0m Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile.\n\x1b[92m[10] Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats.\x1b[0m It’s passed from the liver through a series of channels, known as bile ducts, into the gallbladder.\nThe bile is stored in the gallbladder and over time it becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it’s needed.\nWhat causes\xa0gallstones?\nGallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder.
