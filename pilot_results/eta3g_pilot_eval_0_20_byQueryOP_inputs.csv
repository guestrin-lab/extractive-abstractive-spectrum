', ""New Earswick is a model village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire, England, near the River Foss, north of York and south of Haxby. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,812, reducing to 2,737 at the 2011 Census. The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority. History The village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, 'I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities'. The first 28 houses were designed between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new village. The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Hartrigg Oaks Complex The village had contemporaries such as Bournville, Saltaire, Port Sunlight and others. It presented a sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the 19th century, the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree's report of 1901, entitled Poverty: a study of town life. It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and insanitary housing. As a result of the report, Joseph Rowntree's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new 'garden' village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. "", 'Garden Village of New EarswickListenThe ‘garden village’ of New Earswick on the northern side of York influenced housing patterns in England and elsewhere for more than 60 years of the 20th century. It was built for Joseph Rowntree (1835-1925) the Quaker chocolate and cocoa manufacturer whose factory was nearby. Construction began in 1902 the year after the publication by Rowntree’s son, Seebohm Rowntree (1871-1954) of his social survey of York, Poverty: a study of town life. The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall. Many of the houses were built in cul-de-sacs which set an example that was copied by builders all over England in the 1920s and 30s. There are extensive open spaces and many trees. Bricks were made from local clay, and the site of the brickyard, which closed in the 1930s, is now a nature reserve.Enlarge mapShrink mapNavigateYour Location?Garden Village of New Earswick ', ""I have recently being doing some work at New Earswick in York, founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree and designed by the practice of Parker and Unwin.

It is important to understand the place of New Earswick within the wider Garden City Movement, which was a broader attempt to reform living conditions for 'workers' as a whole. The Garden City Movement developed in the context of attempts to reform low-income inner city housing in order to improve conditions for the poor. The first attempts came from industrialists such as Titus Salt and the Lever brothers, who developed housing for their workers within walking distance of their factories. The aim of garden cities was to create an urban planning model designed to promote healthier communities in response to problems encountered by rapid urbanisation. The intention was also to create communities with a balanced approach to living conditions, industry, agriculture and recreation.

1,21,"[""What precisely is American federalism? In their seminal work on federal jurisdiction, Felix Frankfurter and Wilber Katz allude to a 'dynamic struggle' between federal and state power, the ebb and flow of competing, sometimes conflicting, spheres of federal and state power and influence. In many respects, the story of American government is the story of how that struggle has been resolved. The antecedents of American federalism trace to colonial days, when the concept of divided sovereign power began to take shape. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies declared themselves to be free and independent states. During the hostilities and at the War’s end, the newly formed states recognized that they needed to operate together to function adequately on the new national stage and to enter the world stage. "", 'In their Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay promoted state ratification of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 9, Hamilton attempted to assuage the concerns that the states would lose sovereignty under the new Constitution: So long as the separate organization of the members be not abolished . . . though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty . . . and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power.25 In Federalist No. 51, Hamilton argued that federalism would help limit the ability of the proposed new central government to abuse its powers: ', ""and eight years after ratification of the Articles of Confederation, which established a league of sovereign states, the nation repealed the Articles of Confederation and ratified a new Constitution creating the United States. Since its ratification the Constitution, which established a union of states under a federal system of governance, two questions have generated considerable debate: What is the nature of the union? What powers, privileges, duties, and responsibilities does the Constitution grant to the national government and reserve to the states and to the people? During the 208-year history of the Constitution the answers to these questions have been debated time and again and have shaped and been shaped by the nation's political, social and economic history. What is federalism? According to James Q. Wilson and John DiIulio, Jr., it is a system of government 'in which sovereignty is shared [between two or more levels of government] so that on some matters the national government is supreme and on others the states, regions, or provincial governments are supreme.1 There are three essential features that characterize a federal system of governance. First, there must be a provision for more than one level of government to act simultaneously on the same territory and on the same citizens. The American federal system is composed of a national government and the 50 states, both recognized by the Constitution. Local governments, creations of states, while not mentioned in the Constitution, are nevertheless key players in American federalism. Their power to regulate and legislate is derived from state Constitutions. Second, each government must have its own authority and sphere of power, though they may overlap. When state and federal authority conflict, federal law is supreme under the Constitution. Article I, Sec. 8 of the Constitution delegates certain enumerated powers to the national government that includes "", 'In This Chapter Study PlanChapter OutlineDiagnostic/Quiz+ Multiple-Choice QuizzesVocabulary FlashcardsAnalyzing the Evidence ExercisesEbook Chapter 3Federalism and the Separation of Powers Chapter Study Outline Introduction One great achievement of the American founding was the creation of an effective constitutional structure of political institutions. Two important aspects of the U.S. Constitution—federalism and the separation of powers—represent, in part, the framers’ efforts to divide governmental power. Federalism limits government by creating two sovereign powers—the national government and state governments—thereby restraining the influence of both. Separation of powers imposes internal limits by dividing government against itself, giving different branches separate functions and forcing them to share power. Who Does What? Federalism and Institutional Jurisdictions ', ""Federalism also invulves some limitations on state authority, particularly invulving relationships between state governments. Local governments, while not recognized in the Constitution, are used by states in conducting the activities of government. Under the traditional system of 'dual federalism,' which lasted from 1789 to 1937, there was a relatively clear division of federal power, with the national government limiting itself primarily to promoting commerce (buttressed by cases such as McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden), while the states did most of the governing. "", ""Faced with the very real problems of a weak central government, Congress issued a resolution in February 1787 calling for a convention to amend the Articles of Confederation.  But at the Philadelphia convention, which opened on May 25, 1787, delegates quickly began to consider an entirely new form of government, federalism, which shared power between the states and a more robust central government with truly national powers.After four months, the delegates drastically changed the relationship among the states and created a new national government, abandoning the Articles of Confederation.  This new government had executive and judicial powers, along with expanded legislative authority.  Unlike the Confederation, states in the new legislature would not be represented equally.  Instead, big states with large populations exercised more power in Congress.  Slaveholding states were allowed to count three-fifths of their enslaved population for representation and taxation purposes.  To count slaves fully would only have increased the political power of slave states.On September 17, 1787, the delegates approved and signed an entirely new Constitution for the United States of America.  Once approved by the people, the Constitution's federal system would create a unique solution to sharing power among the states and the national government.  Even George Washington admitted that the Constitution was not perfect, but rather--in the words of its Preamble--the next step in 'a more perfect union.'Federalism content written by Linda R. Monk, Constitutional scholar "", ""(a) 'Policies that have federalism implications'' refers to regulations, legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. (b) 'State'' or 'States'' refer to the States of the United States of America, individually or collectively, and, where relevant, to State governments, including units of local government and other political subdivisions established by the States. Sec. 2. Fundamental Federalism Principles. In formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications, Executive departments and agencies shall be guided by the following fundamental federalism principles: (a) Federalism is rooted in the knowledge that our political liberties are best assured by limiting the size and scope of the national government. "", ""At the Federal Convention of 1787, now known as the Constitutional Convention, the framers of the United States Constitution established in Article I the structure and powers of Congress. The delegates who gathered in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787, first to revise the existing form of government and then to frame a new Constitution, debated the idea of a Congress made up of two houses. One house would be, in the words of Virginia’s George Mason, the 'grand depository of the democratic principle of government.' To counter this popular influence in the national government, James Madison of Virginia proposed another house that would be small, deliberative, and independent from the larger, more democratic house. This became the Senate. "", 'Federalism can be found in a number of areas in the US Constitution. It is perhaps most clear through the use of enumerated powers, clearly allocating responsibilities to the Federal Government and responsibilities to the State Governments. In addition to this, it is also shown through the concurrent and implied powers.

In their seminal work on federal jurisdiction, Felix Frankfurter and Wilber Katz allude to a 'dynamic struggle' between federal and state power, the ebb and flow of competing, sometimes conflicting, spheres of federal and state power and influence. In many respects, the story of American government is the story of how that struggle has been resolved. The antecedents of American federalism trace to colonial days, when the concept of divided sovereign power began to take shape. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies declared themselves to be free and independent states. During the hostilities and at the War’s end, the newly formed states recognized that they needed to operate together to function adequately on the new national stage and to enter the world stage. "", 'https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/foundations-of-u-s-federalism/\nIn their Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay promoted state ratification of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 9, Hamilton attempted to assuage the concerns that the states would lose sovereignty under the new Constitution: So long as the separate organization of the members be not abolished . . . though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty . . . and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power.25 In Federalist No. 51, Hamilton argued that federalism would help limit the ability of the proposed new central government to abuse its powers: ', ""https://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/gov/federal.htm\nand eight years after ratification of the Articles of Confederation, which established a league of sovereign states, the nation repealed the Articles of Confederation and ratified a new Constitution creating the United States. Since its ratification the Constitution, which established a union of states under a federal system of governance, two questions have generated considerable debate: What is the nature of the union? What powers, privileges, duties, and responsibilities does the Constitution grant to the national government and reserve to the states and to the people? During the 208-year history of the Constitution the answers to these questions have been debated time and again and have shaped and been shaped by the nation's political, social and economic history. What is federalism? According to James Q. Wilson and John DiIulio, Jr., it is a system of government 'in which sovereignty is shared [between two or more levels of government] so that on some matters the national government is supreme and on others the states, regions, or provincial governments are supreme.1 There are three essential features that characterize a federal system of governance. First, there must be a provision for more than one level of government to act simultaneously on the same territory and on the same citizens. The American federal system is composed of a national government and the 50 states, both recognized by the Constitution. Local governments, creations of states, while not mentioned in the Constitution, are nevertheless key players in American federalism. Their power to regulate and legislate is derived from state Constitutions. Second, each government must have its own authority and sphere of power, though they may overlap. When state and federal authority conflict, federal law is supreme under the Constitution. Article I, Sec. 8 of the Constitution delegates certain enumerated powers to the national government that includes "", 'https://wwnorton.com/college/polisci/american-government12/brief/ch/03/outline.aspx\nIn This Chapter Study PlanChapter OutlineDiagnostic/Quiz+ Multiple-Choice QuizzesVocabulary FlashcardsAnalyzing the Evidence ExercisesEbook Chapter 3Federalism and the Separation of Powers Chapter Study Outline Introduction One great achievement of the American founding was the creation of an effective constitutional structure of political institutions. Two important aspects of the U.S. Constitution—federalism and the separation of powers—represent, in part, the framers’ efforts to divide governmental power. Federalism limits government by creating two sovereign powers—the national government and state governments—thereby restraining the influence of both. Separation of powers imposes internal limits by dividing government against itself, giving different branches separate functions and forcing them to share power. Who Does What? Federalism and Institutional Jurisdictions ', ""https://wwnorton.com/college/polisci/american-government12/brief/ch/03/outline.aspx\nFederalism also invulves some limitations on state authority, particularly invulving relationships between state governments. Local governments, while not recognized in the Constitution, are used by states in conducting the activities of government. Under the traditional system of 'dual federalism,' which lasted from 1789 to 1937, there was a relatively clear division of federal power, with the national government limiting itself primarily to promoting commerce (buttressed by cases such as McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden), while the states did most of the governing. "", ""https://www.pbs.org/tpt/constitution-usa-peter-sagal/federalism/\nFaced with the very real problems of a weak central government, Congress issued a resolution in February 1787 calling for a convention to amend the Articles of Confederation.  But at the Philadelphia convention, which opened on May 25, 1787, delegates quickly began to consider an entirely new form of government, federalism, which shared power between the states and a more robust central government with truly national powers.After four months, the delegates drastically changed the relationship among the states and created a new national government, abandoning the Articles of Confederation.  This new government had executive and judicial powers, along with expanded legislative authority.  Unlike the Confederation, states in the new legislature would not be represented equally.  Instead, big states with large populations exercised more power in Congress.  Slaveholding states were allowed to count three-fifths of their enslaved population for representation and taxation purposes.  To count slaves fully would only have increased the political power of slave states.On September 17, 1787, the delegates approved and signed an entirely new Constitution for the United States of America.  Once approved by the people, the Constitution's federal system would create a unique solution to sharing power among the states and the national government.  Even George Washington admitted that the Constitution was not perfect, but rather--in the words of its Preamble--the next step in 'a more perfect union.'Federalism content written by Linda R. Monk, Constitutional scholar "", ""https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/executive-order-12612-federalism\n(a) 'Policies that have federalism implications'' refers to regulations, legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. (b) 'State'' or 'States'' refer to the States of the United States of America, individually or collectively, and, where relevant, to State governments, including units of local government and other political subdivisions established by the States. Sec. 2. Fundamental Federalism Principles. In formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications, Executive departments and agencies shall be guided by the following fundamental federalism principles: (a) Federalism is rooted in the knowledge that our political liberties are best assured by limiting the size and scope of the national government. "", ""https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution.htm\nAt the Federal Convention of 1787, now known as the Constitutional Convention, the framers of the United States Constitution established in Article I the structure and powers of Congress. The delegates who gathered in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787, first to revise the existing form of government and then to frame a new Constitution, debated the idea of a Congress made up of two houses. One house would be, in the words of Virginia’s George Mason, the 'grand depository of the democratic principle of government.' To counter this popular influence in the national government, James Madison of Virginia proposed another house that would be small, deliberative, and independent from the larger, more democratic house. This became the Senate.

', ""In vertebrates, the gallbladder, also known as the cholecyst, is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine. In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and stores it. The bile is then released via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats. The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved – usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder (called a cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease. Structure The gallbladder is a hollow grey-blue organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the liver. In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 inches) in length and 4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter when fully distended. The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres (1.8 imperial fluid ounces). The gallbladder is shaped like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct. The gallbladder is divided into three sections: the fundus, body, and neck. The fundus is the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree. The gallbladder fossa, against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V.

The new intro also showcases battles taking place within the saga, such as Vegeta vs. #18, Piccolo vs. #17, #16 vs. Cell, Goku vs. Cell, and ends showing a sequence of the Dragon Team standing together with their Cell Saga appearances. The ending credits are also different, showcasing Goku flying with Shenron as the faces of the main cast appear. He proceeds to transform into a Super Saiyan and the cast joins him in flight.

A few years later, the series returned with 61 Majin Buu Saga episodes in Japan.[1] English adaptations Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' logo The title screen translations are far more similar this time around, but are changed to fit properly into English. Edits were made to the version appearing on Nicktoons, including the removal of blood (which was sometimes replaced with black grayish liquid where the blood is supposed to be), overly violent moments, profanity and others. The CW's Toonzai airings, however, were edited even more so than the Nicktoons version, due to tighter restrictions on broadcast programming. These edits include recoloring Mr. Popo's skin from black to blue, replacing dead characters' halos with glowing orbs, removing virtually all references to death in both dialogue and episode titles, and renaming certain special techniques (i.e. Goku's Spirit Bomb renamed as the 'Spirit Blast' and Vegeta's Galick Gun as the 'Galick Blast'). Also in the beginning of the intro song, Toonzai edited out Shenron and replaced him with a green colored sky. When Toonzai became Vortexx, these edits remained but the halos/glowing orbs were removed altogether. On Nicktoons, the series aired from May 24, 2010 to February 8, 2013; on Toonzai/Vortexx, the series aired from August 14, 2010 to September 27, 2014 when the block was cancelled. Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' promotional image The series returned with the 69 Majin Buu Saga episodes in 2014 in Europe, carrying the sub-title 'The Final Chapters'. This remastered and reedited series was broadcasted in the UK on Kix, in Portugal on Sic Radical, in Poland on AXN Spin, and in France on Game One. On May 25, 2014, Funimation and Adult Swim announced that the English dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai would air uncut on Adult Swim's Toonami block starting in fall 2014.[6] The show began airing at 12:00 AM on November 8, 2014, replacing Bleach.

"", ""Dragon Ball Z uses four pieces of theme music in the Japanese version. From episodes 1–199, the opening theme is 'Cha-La Head-Cha-La' by Hironobu Kageyama, and the closing theme is 'Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Pawā!' by MANNA. From episodes 200–291, the opening and closing themes are 'We Gotta Power' and 'Boku-Tachi wa Tenshi Datta,' both by Hironobu Kageyama. Series overview In Japan, Dragon Ball Z was aired year-round continuously, with regular off-days for sporting events and television specials taking place about once every six weeks on average. The English broadcast was divided into eight separate near-continuous blocks with breaks varying between four months to over a year between each block. Only in one instance, between episodes 194 and 195, was there actually parity between the DVD release and the actual broadcast sequence in terms of the end of one 'season' and the beginning of the next. "", ""Vegeta acknowledging his rival as he fought Kid Buu was a defining moment for Vegeta's character growth. The final Spirit Bomb that Goku launches on Kid Buu is also pretty great to witness in its own right. 3 Everyone Vs Frieza Episodes: 77-86 The Z Warriors put everything on the line to survive Frieza's relentless assault For what it’s worth, the fight against Frieza starts off well-paced enough in the anime. The first 8 episodes are dedicated to everything before Goku shows up, which actually does have a fair bit of material to adapt – perhaps not 8 episodes’ worth, but it’s not an unreasonable number when taking into account how much of an endurance match the battle with Frieza is. Problems start to arise when you look at the arc in perspective, however. Along with these initial 8 episodes, the final fight against Frieza lasts nearly 30 episodes in Dragon Ball Z. That’s over half a year of syndication for a single battle. In the grand scheme of things, it’s simply too much. "", 'The original Dragon Ball finds the perfect length that’s neither too cumbersome nor brief, which is appropriate as Toriyama tests the waters and sees what audiences think of this heightened world. Dragon Ball, as a manga, ran for 194 chapters, which has been compiled into 16 volumes. It’s a respectable length for a starter shonen series. Alternatively, Dragon Ball’s anime adaptation is 153 episodes and it doesn’t stray very far from its source material. There are a handful of filler episodes, but the Dragon Ball anime is quite faithful to its manga and doesn’t indulge in any wild detours. There was originally no official delineation between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z in Toriyama’s manga. Chapter 196 just kicked off with a five-year time-jump that ushers in Goku’s adult adventures, now with a family and young child. Dragon Ball saw plenty of success, but Dragon Ball Z catapulted this fame to new heights with a greater emphasis on action, ki-based combat, and powerful transformations. Dragon Ball Z is significantly longer than its predecessor and it makes up the majority of the Dragon Ball franchise. The manga ran for 325 chapters across 26 volumes, which brings it and the original Dragon Ball to a combined 519 chapters of material. Dragon Ball Z’s anime is also not one for brevity and it nearly doubles the original series’ episode count at 291. Dragon Ball Z doesn’t remove any of its manga’s storylines, but it does get more indulgent with filler material, particularly when it comes to extending fights. ', ""Dragon Ball Super changed fans' standard of quality. It also made them reconsider Dragon Ball GT and wonder whether it was a good show. Dragon Ball Super is the latest canonical Dragon Ball entry and it continues to turn out new content and contribute to the greater Dragon Ball lore. Dragon Ball Super was developed as an alternate sequel series to Dragon Ball Z that disregards Dragon Ball GT. However, Dragon Ball Super is curiously set right after Kid Buu’s defeat. This means that the entire series takes place before Dragon Ball Z’s Peaceful World Saga ending, which turns the clock forward ten years for its epilogue, which is set at the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament. Dragon Ball Super has crammed a tremendous amount into this ten-year window, even if some of it pushes the limits of incredulity. Dragon Ball Super produced 131 episodes before its relatively abrupt finale during the Tournament of Power’s conclusion.

Perplexing discoveries have ignited explorers’ imaginations: a flat stone inscribed in code; a flood tunnel draining from a man-made beach; a torn scrap of parchment; stone markers forming a huge cross. Swaths of the island were bulldozed looking for answers; excavation attempts have claimed two lives. Theories abound as to what’s hidden on Oak Island–pirates’ treasure, Marie Antoinette’s lost jewels, the Holy Grail, proof that Sir Francis Bacon was the true author of Shakespeare’s plays–yet to this day, the Money Pit remains an enigma.

Funny Or Die The word boss, borrowed from the Dutch, has been with American English language since the mid-1600s. Boss has long meant, and continues to mean, a 'person in charge,' especially used, of course, in professional contexts. Boss has also long been a slang term for 'excellent,' with evidence reaching back to the 1880s. Boss took off, though, as a youth slang term for 'superlative' and the like ('That new song is boss') in the 1960s. Ice Cube’s 1993 song 'Really Doe' may be one of the earliest recorded uses of the expression. On that track, Ice Cube raps: 'Out like a boss, with a half-pint of sauce / Got the shit sewed up like Betsy Ross.' Rappers Das EFX and Goodie Mob also used the line like a boss in 1995 and 1999 tracks, respectively.

Slim Thug went on to record a track called 'Like a Boss' in 2005, featuring the rapper listing all the things he does like a boss in a call-and-response style. This inspired a viral video and song by Saturday Night Live’s Andy Samberg, which greatly popularized the phrase. Andy Samberg’s comedy music group, The Lonely Island, parodied Slim Thug’s rap on their own song 'Like a Boss' in 2009. The song was released on their album Incredibad in February, with a video starring Samberg and Seth Rogan which debuted on Saturday Night Live that April. In the video, Samberg plays an office manager receiving his review from a superior played by Rogan. Samberg begins by describing normal managerial duties, like calling his corporate office and approving memos (repeatedly interjected with like a boss), but then moves on to describing a failed attempt to hit on an employee, a downward spiral of self-destructive behaviors, and finally, absurd actions like turning into a jet and flying into the sun.

These rights are known as 'fundamental' as they are the most essential for all-round development i.e., material, intellectual, moral and spiritual and protected by fundamental law of the land i.e. constitution. If the rights provided by Constitution especially the Fundamental rights are violated the Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue writs under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, respectively, directing the State Machinery for enforcement of the fundamental rights. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms where every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality and life. These rights apply universally to all citizens of India, irrespective of their race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to certain restrictions. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. Fundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and hence prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour. They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. When the Constitution of India came into force it basically gave seven fundamental rights to its citizens. However, Right to Property was removed as a Fundamental Right through 44th Constitutional Amendment in 1978. In 2009, Right to Education Act was added.

The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India. ', ""The Right to Freedom is covered in Article 19 to 22, with the view of guaranteeing individual rights that were considered vital by the framers of the Constitution, and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on individual liberty under specified conditions. Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may be imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences and defamation. The State is also empowered, in the interests of the general public to nationalize any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens. The freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are further sought to be protected by Articles 20–22. The scope of these articles, particularly with respect to the doctrine of due process, was heavily debated by the Constituent Assembly. It was argued, especially by Benegal Narsing Rau, that the incorporation of such a clause would hamper social legislation and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order, and therefore it ought to be excluded from the Constitution altogether. The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase 'due process' in favor of 'procedure established by law'. As a result, Article 21, which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by law, was, until 1978, construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action. However, in 1978, the Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action, holding that any law laying down a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable, and effectively reading due process into Article 21. In the same case, the Supreme Court also ruled that 'life' under Article 21 meant more than a mere 'animal existence'; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life 'meaningful, complete and worth living'. Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood, good health, clean environment, water, speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned.

Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience and the right to preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, and the power of the State to take measures for social welfare and reform.

Steinman believed that CBS were expecting him to write something similar to 'It's a Heartache', but he had different ideas. Music video Holloway Sanatorium steps, which feature in the video The music video for 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' was directed by Russell Mulcahy and was filmed at the Holloway Sanatorium, a large Victorian Gothic hospital near Virginia Water, Surrey, England. The surrealist video features Tyler clad in white, dreaming or fantasizing about students in a boys' boarding school. Young men are seen dancing and participating in various school activities and singing in a choir. The video received two nominations at the Billboard Video Music Awards in 1983 for Best Performance by a Female and Most Effective Use of Symbolism. A long-running urban legend is that the boy who appears throughout the video and who shakes Tyler's hand at the end is former Italian footballer Gianfranco Zola. In a 2012 interview, Zola confirmed that he did not appear in the video. In September 2023, the video exceeded one billion views on YouTube. Live performances Since the song's release, Tyler has performed 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' in all of her concerts. 'I sing it much better now than I used to,' she told The Huffington Post. 'I think my voice is probably not as husky as it was, I think it's mellowed a bit.' The song was performed at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards, held at the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, on 28 February 1984. Bonnie Tyler sang 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' live on board a Royal Caribbean cruise ship during the solar eclipse of 21 August 2017, backed by DNCE.

In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation's third-favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV. The song's lyrics compare an ended romance with an eclipse. The song often receives publicity during solar eclipses and lunar eclipses. 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' received substantial media attention during the solar eclipse of 20 March 2015. Tyler's version received a 214% increase of Spotify streams throughout the day. A similar impact was experienced during the solar eclipse of 21 August 2017, when Nielsen Music reported a 503% increase in record sales. Around that time, the song hit number one on the iTunes chart.

One year later, a new version of the song, now a duet with fellow Italian singer Nek was officially released as a single, this duet peaking at number 6 on the Italian charts. Glee cast version The hit musical comedy-drama series Glee reworked the song for its season one episode 'Bad Reputation,' recorded by cast members Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Mark Salling, and special guest star Jonathan Groff as their characters Rachel Berry, Finn Hudson, Noah Puckerman, and Jesse St. James respectively.

If you’re wondering what the song is about—the particular story it tells—I can’t help you. It communicates only great anguish over some unspecified loss: 'Once upon a time there was light in my life, but now there’s only love in the dark,' Tyler gasps. You might be thinking that love in the dark doesn’t sound so bad.

They compete in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system. They play their home matches at the Select Car Leasing Stadium. Reading are nicknamed The Royals, due to Reading's location in the Royal County of Berkshire, though they were previously known as The Biscuitmen, due to the town's association with biscuit maker Huntley & Palmers. Established in 1871, the club is one of the oldest teams in England, but did not join The Football League until 1920, and first played in the top tier of English football league system in the 2006–07 season. The club competed in the 2012–13 Premier League season, having gained promotion at the end of the 2011–12 season after winning the Championship, but were relegated after just one season back in the top flight. Reading won the 1987–88 Full Members' Cup and were one of only two Second Division clubs to lift the trophy, beating Luton Town 4–1 in the final at Wembley. The club's best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the semi-finals which they achieved twice: in 1926–27 and 2014–15. The club played at Elm Park for 102 years, from 1896 to 1998. In 1998, the club moved to the new Madejski Stadium, which was named after the club's former chairman Sir John Madejski. In 2021, the club announced that the ground would be known as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the subsequent decade for sponsorship reasons. "", ""Reading started the 2008–09 season with a 15 match unbeaten home run. They finished fourth and qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Burnley in the semi-final. Manager Steve Coppell resigned just hours after the game, replaced by Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009 and Brian McDermott made caretaker manager the same day. In the 2010–11 FA Cup, Reading reached the quarter-final, where they lost 1–0 to Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, Reading eventually finished fifth in the Championship to qualify for the division's play-offs. After beating Cardiff City in the semi-finals, they lost 4–2 to Swansea City in the final at Wembley. In the 2011–12 season, a streak of good form in the second half of the season, ensured promotion back to the Premier League on 17 April 2012 with 1–0 home win against Nottingham Forest. "", ""In the summer leading up to the 2016–17 season the club announced the departure of Brian McDermott and eventually he was to be replaced by former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam. Under Stam, Reading achieved their highest finish since relegation back to the Championship by finishing third and reaching the play-offs, where they beat Fulham on aggregate before facing Huddersfield Town in the final at Wembley where they lost on penalties following 0–0 draw after extra time. In 2017, Chinese investors Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li acquired the club. The team languished towards the bottom of the table for most of the 2017–18 season. On 21 March 2018, Stam resigned as manager after a nine-game winless run. Two days later, on 23 March 2018, Paul Clement was appointed as Reading's new manager; the club finished the season in 20th place, avoiding relegation by three points. "", ""On 17 November 2021 it was confirmed Reading would be deducted six points due to breaching the EFL's profitability and sustainability rules. Over five years, the club reported pre-tax losses of £146m, way beyond the EFL's limit of a £13m annual pre-tax loss. In 2021, the club spent 234% of its revenue on player wages. Following a 3–2 away victory over Preston North End in February 2022, manager Veljko Paunović left by mutual consent, with Paul Ince being placed in interim charge of the team alongside academy manager Michael Gilkes. On 16 May, Ince became the team's permanent manager, with Mark Bowen returning as head of football operations. "", ""In June 2023, Reading were charged by the EFL with failing to pay their players on time and in full, in October and November 2022, and April 2023, and with non-payment of taxes - charges that meant Reading might start their 2023–24 League One season with a points deduction. Following the EFL's action, Reading fans groups united to launch a campaign, Sell Before We Dai, urging owner Dai Yongge to sell the club, calling his stewardship 'an unmitigated disaster' and citing the club's 'excruciating financial losses'. On 27 June, Reading were served a winding-up petition by HMRC over the unpaid tax bills, with a hearing set for 9 August (on 12 July, football finance expert Kieran Maguire described the club's ownership as 'a car crash'). On 28 July, the club was placed under another transfer embargo because of the unpaid taxes. On 2 August, Dai Yongge was reported to be seeking new investors to bring financial stability to the club. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2023, Reading announced the provisional appointment of Rubén Sellés as their new manager, confirmed on 14 July, after his visa application was successful. On 16 August 2023, after one win and two defeats in their opening three league fixtures, Reading had a point deducted (their third deduction in three consecutive seasons), and a further three-point deduction suspended, for its failures to pay players fully and on time during the 2022–23 season. Dai Yongge was ordered to pay 125% of the club's forecast monthly wages into a designated account. Failure to comply, or not paying wages on time up to 30 June 2024, would activate the suspended penalty; the three-point deduction was applied on 13 September, and Dai Yongge faced a misconduct charge. On 29 September 2023, Dai Yongge said he was open to 'credible offers of interest' to buy the club after another transfer embargo was imposed in respect to an outstanding tax bill. A 3–2 home defeat by Portsmouth on 28 October dropped the club to the bottom of League One on six points, eight from safety; the match was preceded by a fans protest against Dai Yongge's ownership. On 31 October, the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. On 1 November, Reading were referred to an EFL independent disciplinary commission regarding unpaid HMRC debts owed in September and October 2023. On 9 November, a sale of the club was reported to be progressing, and the latest winding-up petition and transfer embargo had been resolved. On 19 December 2023, Dai Yongge was fined £20,000 for Reading's wages failures; the EFL had recommended a 12-month ban from all football activities, but an independent disciplinary commission opted not to enforce it. A further £50,000 fine was suspended until 12 January 2024, and was triggered after Dai Yongge again failed to make the required full wage deposits. On 27 February 2024, Reading received their second points deduction of the season, being docked two more points by the EFL after failing to make HMRC payments within an 80-day limit. The deduction left the club three points above the relegation places. In total, under Dai Yongge's ownership, the club has had 18 points deducted. In March 2024, Dai Yongge was 'open to the sale' of the club's Bearwood Park training facility to secure funding while new owners were sought, a move criticised by supporters groups for the confusing message it sent to potential investors; the club faces a cash shortfall of about £1m for March. On 14 March, Reading announced they were holding talks with Wycombe Wanderers over the sale of Bearwood Park, but Wycombe put the talks 'on hold' after learning that 'planning limitations allowed only Reading to use the grounds'.

Following a 3–2 away victory over Preston North End in February 2022, manager Veljko Paunović left by mutual consent, with Paul Ince being placed in interim charge of the team alongside academy manager Michael Gilkes. On 16 May, Ince became the team's permanent manager, with Mark Bowen returning as head of football operations. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_F.C.\nIn June 2023, Reading were charged by the EFL with failing to pay their players on time and in full, in October and November 2022, and April 2023, and with non-payment of taxes - charges that meant Reading might start their 2023–24 League One season with a points deduction. Following the EFL's action, Reading fans groups united to launch a campaign, Sell Before We Dai, urging owner Dai Yongge to sell the club, calling his stewardship 'an unmitigated disaster' and citing the club's 'excruciating financial losses'. On 27 June, Reading were served a winding-up petition by HMRC over the unpaid tax bills, with a hearing set for 9 August (on 12 July, football finance expert Kieran Maguire described the club's ownership as 'a car crash'). On 28 July, the club was placed under another transfer embargo because of the unpaid taxes. On 2 August, Dai Yongge was reported to be seeking new investors to bring financial stability to the club. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2023, Reading announced the provisional appointment of Rubén Sellés as their new manager, confirmed on 14 July, after his visa application was successful. On 16 August 2023, after one win and two defeats in their opening three league fixtures, Reading had a point deducted (their third deduction in three consecutive seasons), and a further three-point deduction suspended, for its failures to pay players fully and on time during the 2022–23 season. Dai Yongge was ordered to pay 125% of the club's forecast monthly wages into a designated account. Failure to comply, or not paying wages on time up to 30 June 2024, would activate the suspended penalty; the three-point deduction was applied on 13 September, and Dai Yongge faced a misconduct charge. On 29 September 2023, Dai Yongge said he was open to 'credible offers of interest' to buy the club after another transfer embargo was imposed in respect to an outstanding tax bill. A 3–2 home defeat by Portsmouth on 28 October dropped the club to the bottom of League One on six points, eight from safety; the match was preceded by a fans protest against Dai Yongge's ownership. On 31 October, the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. On 1 November, Reading were referred to an EFL independent disciplinary commission regarding unpaid HMRC debts owed in September and October 2023. On 9 November, a sale of the club was reported to be progressing, and the latest winding-up petition and transfer embargo had been resolved. On 19 December 2023, Dai Yongge was fined £20,000 for Reading's wages failures; the EFL had recommended a 12-month ban from all football activities, but an independent disciplinary commission opted not to enforce it. A further £50,000 fine was suspended until 12 January 2024, and was triggered after Dai Yongge again failed to make the required full wage deposits. On 27 February 2024, Reading received their second points deduction of the season, being docked two more points by the EFL after failing to make HMRC payments within an 80-day limit. The deduction left the club three points above the relegation places. In total, under Dai Yongge's ownership, the club has had 18 points deducted. In March 2024, Dai Yongge was 'open to the sale' of the club's Bearwood Park training facility to secure funding while new owners were sought, a move criticised by supporters groups for the confusing message it sent to potential investors; the club faces a cash shortfall of about £1m for March. On 14 March, Reading announced they were holding talks with Wycombe Wanderers over the sale of Bearwood Park, but Wycombe put the talks 'on hold' after learning that 'planning limitations allowed only Reading to use the grounds'.

10,15,"[""'Like a Boss' is a song written and recorded by comedy hip hop troupe The Lonely Island and released on their debut studio album Incredibad. The song is a parody of the song of the same name from Slim Thug's debut album Already Platinum. The song is narrated by a businessman (Andy Samberg) who describes his increasingly outlandish daily activities as 'the boss'. The music video initially aired as an SNL Digital Short on Saturday Night Live with actor Seth Rogen. In 2011, it was subject to a lawsuit from the producers of the song, who claimed they never received proper compensation for their work. Song 'Like a Boss' premiered as a Saturday Night Live Digital Short on April 4, 2009. In the song, Andy Samberg is a businessman, evidently in middle management, having a performance review. The reviewer asks him to describe the things he does in an average day, and does so for the remainder of the song in his trademark aggressive style, with the activities described initially being mundane management tasks but becoming increasingly bizarre throughout the course of the song. The lyrics 'like a boss' are repeated after every activity. This song parodies the song of the same name by Slim Thug. Video "", ""Prior to the release of the video on Saturday Night Live, the term 'Like a Boss' was not often searched for or used in social context. Though it was indeed searched for prior to the release of the video, the term clearly spiked at release and peaked on Google on April 29, 2009, hitting a 100 on the Google Trend chart. It also gained popularity on social media sites such as Twitter Tumblr, and Facebook, where it became a popular hashtag to indicate one's pride in completing a task or achieving a goal. It has also led to parody videos such as 'Like a Bus', where a bus is shown flying through traffic and often bad weather conditions with no regard or slowing for the bad conditions. On 22 October 2012, 'Like A Boss' surpassed 100 million views. The video was featured by The Huffington Post, and TV Guide. Lawsuit "", ""The phrase stems from The Lonely Island's single 'Like A Boss,' a parody of the Slim Thug song of the same name.[1] Featuring Andy Samberg and Seth Rogen, the video premiered on Saturday Night Live as a digital short on April 4th, 2009. In the video, the Boss (Samberg) is asked to go over his daily activities during a performance review by Rogen's character. While it starts out with daily office tasks, the lyrics evolve into impossible activities. Sample lyrics from The Lonely Island's Like a Boss [2] Crash my car (like a boss) Chop my balls off (like a boss) Turn into a jet (like a boss) Bomb the Russians (like a boss) Crash into the sun (like a boss) Now I'm dead (like a boss) Spread The day after the video aired on SNL, it was shared by the Huffington Post[3], Laughing Squid[4], Funny or Die[5] and Digg, where it received 3645 upvotes.[6] On June 5th, 2009 the site InstantBoss.org[8] was created, which gave users a button that would play a single 'Like a Boss' line. "", ""The noughties was the time 'Like A Boss' first began to gain traction. Remember Slim Thug acting like a cornrowed Buddy Ackerman in his music video? Inadvertently, this was an appropriate way to act, because a boss can be an arrogant bastard who revels in his authoritative position, looking down at his workforce like a dick, shouting the odds like a prick, and chucking papers about like a cock. So what is a boss really? Well firstly and most importantly, it’s the endorsement and validation of hierarchy, that someone who is paid more, wears an expensive suit, and has a better parking space is somehow the most skilled at their job and that in turn means he or she can bark orders at those below. In a historical setting, a boss was your 'better' in terms of class or skin-tone. After slavery ended for instance, the word 'Master' was replaced by 'Boss' but the connotations of being one’s ruler or overseer never went away. "", ""like a boss Meaning & Origin | Slang by Dictionary.com libtard litty Examples Origin Usage Slang dictionary like a boss What does like a boss mean? To do something like a boss is to do it with stylish confidence or authority. This can be applied, tongue in cheek, even to fairly mundane tasks. Where does like a boss come from? Funny Or Die The word boss, borrowed from the Dutch, has been with American English language since the mid-1600s. Boss has long meant, and continues to mean, a 'person in charge,' especially used, of course, in professional contexts. Boss has also long been a slang term for 'excellent,' with evidence reaching back to the 1880s. Boss took off, though, as a youth slang term for 'superlative' and the like ('That new song is boss') in the 1960s. Ice Cube’s 1993 song 'Really Doe' may be one of the earliest recorded uses of the expression. On that track, Ice Cube raps: 'Out like a boss, with a half-pint of sauce / Got the shit sewed up like Betsy Ross.' Rappers Das EFX and Goodie Mob also used the line like a boss in 1995 and 1999 tracks, respectively. In 2001, Houston rapper, Slim Thug proclaimed 'I’m the boss, when I’m flossing my Boss like a boss,' (the Boss he’s flossing, or showing off, possibly refers to a car, the Boss Mustang) on a collaboration with fellow Houston rapper E.S.G. titled 'I’m the Boss.' Slim Thug went on to record a track called 'Like a Boss' in 2005, featuring the rapper listing all the things he does like a boss in a call-and-response style. This inspired a viral video and song by Saturday Night Live’s Andy Samberg, which greatly popularized the phrase. Andy Samberg’s comedy music group, The Lonely Island, parodied Slim Thug’s rap on their own song 'Like a Boss' in 2009. The song was released on their album Incredibad in February, with a video starring Samberg and Seth Rogan which debuted on Saturday Night Live that April. In the video, Samberg plays an office manager receiving his review from a superior played by Rogan. Samberg begins by describing normal managerial duties, like calling his corporate office and approving memos (repeatedly interjected with like a boss), but then moves on to describing a failed attempt to hit on an employee, a downward spiral of self-destructive behaviors, and finally, absurd actions like turning into a jet and flying into the sun. Google searches for like a boss spiked in April 2009, showing a surge of interest in the phrase following the SNL sketch. That June, a website, instantboss.org, that plays the like a boss refrain from the sketch, appeared. SEE MORE EXAMPLES Who uses like a boss? As a meme and hashtag or as a comment in everyday conversation, like a boss conveys a sense of confidence, pride, style, and skill in the way a person has performed some action, e.g. 'I wrote that term paper like a boss.' Echoing Samberg’s song, like a boss is often used as a humorous tag phrase: 'I did the laundry…like a boss.'

"", ""When you are a boss or aspire to talk like one, you want to make sure your ideas get heard and understood. I talked with career experts and linguists about what boss language sounds like and what phrases can undermine good management. Instead of 'No problem/No worries,' try 'I’d be pleased to' or 'Certainly'When you use 'No worries' or 'No problem' as I do, the phrase can actually have the opposite effect.

The song is a parody of the song of the same name from Slim Thug's debut album Already Platinum. The song is narrated by a businessman (Andy Samberg) who describes his increasingly outlandish daily activities as 'the boss'. The music video initially aired as an SNL Digital Short on Saturday Night Live with actor Seth Rogen. In 2011, it was subject to a lawsuit from the producers of the song, who claimed they never received proper compensation for their work. Song 'Like a Boss' premiered as a Saturday Night Live Digital Short on April 4, 2009. In the song, Andy Samberg is a businessman, evidently in middle management, having a performance review. The reviewer asks him to describe the things he does in an average day, and does so for the remainder of the song in his trademark aggressive style, with the activities described initially being mundane management tasks but becoming increasingly bizarre throughout the course of the song. The lyrics 'like a boss' are repeated after every activity. This song parodies the song of the same name by Slim Thug. Video "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Boss\nPrior to the release of the video on Saturday Night Live, the term 'Like a Boss' was not often searched for or used in social context. Though it was indeed searched for prior to the release of the video, the term clearly spiked at release and peaked on Google on April 29, 2009, hitting a 100 on the Google Trend chart. It also gained popularity on social media sites such as Twitter Tumblr, and Facebook, where it became a popular hashtag to indicate one's pride in completing a task or achieving a goal. It has also led to parody videos such as 'Like a Bus', where a bus is shown flying through traffic and often bad weather conditions with no regard or slowing for the bad conditions. On 22 October 2012, 'Like A Boss' surpassed 100 million views. The video was featured by The Huffington Post, and TV Guide.

Remember Slim Thug acting like a cornrowed Buddy Ackerman in his music video? Inadvertently, this was an appropriate way to act, because a boss can be an arrogant bastard who revels in his authoritative position, looking down at his workforce like a dick, shouting the odds like a prick, and chucking papers about like a cock. So what is a boss really? Well firstly and most importantly, it’s the endorsement and validation of hierarchy, that someone who is paid more, wears an expensive suit, and has a better parking space is somehow the most skilled at their job and that in turn means he or she can bark orders at those below. In a historical setting, a boss was your 'better' in terms of class or skin-tone. After slavery ended for instance, the word 'Master' was replaced by 'Boss' but the connotations of being one’s ruler or overseer never went away.

Funny Or Die The word boss, borrowed from the Dutch, has been with American English language since the mid-1600s. Boss has long meant, and continues to mean, a 'person in charge,' especially used, of course, in professional contexts. Boss has also long been a slang term for 'excellent,' with evidence reaching back to the 1880s. Boss took off, though, as a youth slang term for 'superlative' and the like ('That new song is boss') in the 1960s. Ice Cube’s 1993 song 'Really Doe' may be one of the earliest recorded uses of the expression. On that track, Ice Cube raps: 'Out like a boss, with a half-pint of sauce / Got the shit sewed up like Betsy Ross.' Rappers Das EFX and Goodie Mob also used the line like a boss in 1995 and 1999 tracks, respectively. In 2001, Houston rapper, Slim Thug proclaimed 'I’m the boss, when I’m flossing my Boss like a boss,' (the Boss he’s flossing, or showing off, possibly refers to a car, the Boss Mustang) on a collaboration with fellow Houston rapper E.S.G. titled 'I’m the Boss.' Slim Thug went on to record a track called 'Like a Boss' in 2005, featuring the rapper listing all the things he does like a boss in a call-and-response style.

11,11,"[""Reading Football Club (/ˈrɛdɪŋ/ ⓘ RED-ing) is a professional football club based in Reading, Berkshire, England. They compete in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system. They play their home matches at the Select Car Leasing Stadium. Reading are nicknamed The Royals, due to Reading's location in the Royal County of Berkshire, though they were previously known as The Biscuitmen, due to the town's association with biscuit maker Huntley & Palmers. Established in 1871, the club is one of the oldest teams in England, but did not join The Football League until 1920, and first played in the top tier of English football league system in the 2006–07 season. The club competed in the 2012–13 Premier League season, having gained promotion at the end of the 2011–12 season after winning the Championship, but were relegated after just one season back in the top flight. Reading won the 1987–88 Full Members' Cup and were one of only two Second Division clubs to lift the trophy, beating Luton Town 4–1 in the final at Wembley. The club's best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the semi-finals which they achieved twice: in 1926–27 and 2014–15. The club played at Elm Park for 102 years, from 1896 to 1998. In 1998, the club moved to the new Madejski Stadium, which was named after the club's former chairman Sir John Madejski. In 2021, the club announced that the ground would be known as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the subsequent decade for sponsorship reasons. "", ""Reading started the 2008–09 season with a 15 match unbeaten home run. They finished fourth and qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Burnley in the semi-final. Manager Steve Coppell resigned just hours after the game, replaced by Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009 and Brian McDermott made caretaker manager the same day. In the 2010–11 FA Cup, Reading reached the quarter-final, where they lost 1–0 to Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, Reading eventually finished fifth in the Championship to qualify for the division's play-offs. After beating Cardiff City in the semi-finals, they lost 4–2 to Swansea City in the final at Wembley. In the 2011–12 season, a streak of good form in the second half of the season, ensured promotion back to the Premier League on 17 April 2012 with 1–0 home win against Nottingham Forest. "", ""In the summer leading up to the 2016–17 season the club announced the departure of Brian McDermott and eventually he was to be replaced by former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam. Under Stam, Reading achieved their highest finish since relegation back to the Championship by finishing third and reaching the play-offs, where they beat Fulham on aggregate before facing Huddersfield Town in the final at Wembley where they lost on penalties following 0–0 draw after extra time. In 2017, Chinese investors Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li acquired the club. The team languished towards the bottom of the table for most of the 2017–18 season. On 21 March 2018, Stam resigned as manager after a nine-game winless run. Two days later, on 23 March 2018, Paul Clement was appointed as Reading's new manager; the club finished the season in 20th place, avoiding relegation by three points. "", ""On 17 November 2021 it was confirmed Reading would be deducted six points due to breaching the EFL's profitability and sustainability rules. Over five years, the club reported pre-tax losses of £146m, way beyond the EFL's limit of a £13m annual pre-tax loss. In 2021, the club spent 234% of its revenue on player wages. Following a 3–2 away victory over Preston North End in February 2022, manager Veljko Paunović left by mutual consent, with Paul Ince being placed in interim charge of the team alongside academy manager Michael Gilkes. On 16 May, Ince became the team's permanent manager, with Mark Bowen returning as head of football operations. "", ""In June 2023, Reading were charged by the EFL with failing to pay their players on time and in full, in October and November 2022, and April 2023, and with non-payment of taxes - charges that meant Reading might start their 2023–24 League One season with a points deduction. Following the EFL's action, Reading fans groups united to launch a campaign, Sell Before We Dai, urging owner Dai Yongge to sell the club, calling his stewardship 'an unmitigated disaster' and citing the club's 'excruciating financial losses'. On 27 June, Reading were served a winding-up petition by HMRC over the unpaid tax bills, with a hearing set for 9 August (on 12 July, football finance expert Kieran Maguire described the club's ownership as 'a car crash'). On 28 July, the club was placed under another transfer embargo because of the unpaid taxes. On 2 August, Dai Yongge was reported to be seeking new investors to bring financial stability to the club. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2023, Reading announced the provisional appointment of Rubén Sellés as their new manager, confirmed on 14 July, after his visa application was successful. On 16 August 2023, after one win and two defeats in their opening three league fixtures, Reading had a point deducted (their third deduction in three consecutive seasons), and a further three-point deduction suspended, for its failures to pay players fully and on time during the 2022–23 season. Dai Yongge was ordered to pay 125% of the club's forecast monthly wages into a designated account. Failure to comply, or not paying wages on time up to 30 June 2024, would activate the suspended penalty; the three-point deduction was applied on 13 September, and Dai Yongge faced a misconduct charge. On 29 September 2023, Dai Yongge said he was open to 'credible offers of interest' to buy the club after another transfer embargo was imposed in respect to an outstanding tax bill. A 3–2 home defeat by Portsmouth on 28 October dropped the club to the bottom of League One on six points, eight from safety; the match was preceded by a fans protest against Dai Yongge's ownership. On 31 October, the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. On 1 November, Reading were referred to an EFL independent disciplinary commission regarding unpaid HMRC debts owed in September and October 2023. On 9 November, a sale of the club was reported to be progressing, and the latest winding-up petition and transfer embargo had been resolved. On 19 December 2023, Dai Yongge was fined £20,000 for Reading's wages failures; the EFL had recommended a 12-month ban from all football activities, but an independent disciplinary commission opted not to enforce it. A further £50,000 fine was suspended until 12 January 2024, and was triggered after Dai Yongge again failed to make the required full wage deposits. On 27 February 2024, Reading received their second points deduction of the season, being docked two more points by the EFL after failing to make HMRC payments within an 80-day limit. The deduction left the club three points above the relegation places. In total, under Dai Yongge's ownership, the club has had 18 points deducted. In March 2024, Dai Yongge was 'open to the sale' of the club's Bearwood Park training facility to secure funding while new owners were sought, a move criticised by supporters groups for the confusing message it sent to potential investors; the club faces a cash shortfall of about £1m for March. On 14 March, Reading announced they were holding talks with Wycombe Wanderers over the sale of Bearwood Park, but Wycombe put the talks 'on hold' after learning that 'planning limitations allowed only Reading to use the grounds'.

On 29 September 2023, Dai Yongge said he was open to 'credible offers of interest' to buy the club after another transfer embargo was imposed in respect to an outstanding tax bill. A 3–2 home defeat by Portsmouth on 28 October dropped the club to the bottom of League One on six points, eight from safety; the match was preceded by a fans protest against Dai Yongge's ownership. On 31 October, the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. On 1 November, Reading were referred to an EFL independent disciplinary commission regarding unpaid HMRC debts owed in September and October 2023. On 9 November, a sale of the club was reported to be progressing, and the latest winding-up petition and transfer embargo had been resolved. On 19 December 2023, Dai Yongge was fined £20,000 for Reading's wages failures; the EFL had recommended a 12-month ban from all football activities, but an independent disciplinary commission opted not to enforce it. A further £50,000 fine was suspended until 12 January 2024, and was triggered after Dai Yongge again failed to make the required full wage deposits. On 27 February 2024, Reading received their second points deduction of the season, being docked two more points by the EFL after failing to make HMRC payments within an 80-day limit. The deduction left the club three points above the relegation places. In total, under Dai Yongge's ownership, the club has had 18 points deducted. In March 2024, Dai Yongge was 'open to the sale' of the club's Bearwood Park training facility to secure funding while new owners were sought, a move criticised by supporters groups for the confusing message it sent to potential investors; the club faces a cash shortfall of about £1m for March. On 14 March, Reading announced they were holding talks with Wycombe Wanderers over the sale of Bearwood Park, but Wycombe put the talks 'on hold' after learning that 'planning limitations allowed only Reading to use the grounds'.

12,19,"[""Dragon Ball Z Kai, known in Japan as Dragon Ball Kai (ドラゴンボール改, Doragon Bōru Kai, lit. Dragon Ball Revised), is an anime series that is a high-definition remastered and recut of Dragon Ball Z, done for its 20th Anniversary. It premiered on Fuji TV on April 5, 2009, at 9:00 am just before One Piece and ended initially on March 27, 2011, with 97 episodes (a 98th episode was later released straight-to-video), and the two shows were marketed together as 'Dream 9', which refers to the hour in which they both aired. The series average rating was 9.4%, with its maximum being 12.3% (Episode 47) and its minimum being 6.4% (Episode 18). Dragon Ball Kai returned to Japanese TV on April 6, 2014, with the Majin Buu Saga, and ended its run for the second and last time on June 28, 2015, with 61 episodes while the original uncut international version would go on to have 69 episodes (bringing the total episode count of the series to 159 for the original Japanese broadcast and 167 for the extended International broadcast).[1] "", 'For the Androids Saga, the animation in the opening scene and closing credits have been altered a bit to fit the current storyline. New animations of Dr. Gero, Android 19, Android 17, Android 18, Android 16, and Cell appear, as well as the Super Saiyan appearances of Goku, Vegeta, Future Trunks, and Gohan. The new intro also showcases battles taking place within the saga, such as Vegeta vs. #18, Piccolo vs. #17, #16 vs. Cell, Goku vs. Cell, and ends showing a sequence of the Dragon Team standing together with their Cell Saga appearances. The ending credits are also different, showcasing Goku flying with Shenron as the faces of the main cast appear. He proceeds to transform into a Super Saiyan and the cast joins him in flight. The sequence ends with the Z Fighters standing in front of the Earth, with Shenron and Porunga in the backdrop. ', ""Happinet (the Japanese company releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray) announced the Japanese DVD and Blu-ray release would have an end point of '98 Episodes (tentative)' meaning the planned and announced episode count would end at 99.[12] Actually, Dragon Ball Kai was supposed to last for 98 episodes, but everything had originally been thrown off an entire week due to the horrific tsunami that struck Japan the prior week. The series temporarily ended with 97 episodes aired, and the 98th episode was released direct-to-video. A few years later, the series returned with 61 Majin Buu Saga episodes in Japan.[1] English adaptations Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' logo The title screen translations are far more similar this time around, but are changed to fit properly into English. Edits were made to the version appearing on Nicktoons, including the removal of blood (which was sometimes replaced with black grayish liquid where the blood is supposed to be), overly violent moments, profanity and others. The CW's Toonzai airings, however, were edited even more so than the Nicktoons version, due to tighter restrictions on broadcast programming. These edits include recoloring Mr. Popo's skin from black to blue, replacing dead characters' halos with glowing orbs, removing virtually all references to death in both dialogue and episode titles, and renaming certain special techniques (i.e. Goku's Spirit Bomb renamed as the 'Spirit Blast' and Vegeta's Galick Gun as the 'Galick Blast'). Also in the beginning of the intro song, Toonzai edited out Shenron and replaced him with a green colored sky. When Toonzai became Vortexx, these edits remained but the halos/glowing orbs were removed altogether. On Nicktoons, the series aired from May 24, 2010 to February 8, 2013; on Toonzai/Vortexx, the series aired from August 14, 2010 to September 27, 2014 when the block was cancelled. Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' promotional image The series returned with the 69 Majin Buu Saga episodes in 2014 in Europe, carrying the sub-title 'The Final Chapters'. This remastered and reedited series was broadcasted in the UK on Kix, in Portugal on Sic Radical, in Poland on AXN Spin, and in France on Game One. On May 25, 2014, Funimation and Adult Swim announced that the English dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai would air uncut on Adult Swim's Toonami block starting in fall 2014.[6] The show began airing at 12:00 AM on November 8, 2014, replacing Bleach. Starting on February 21, 2015, a rerun of the previous weeks episode began airing at 8:00 PM on Saturdays outside of the Toonami block, with a new episode at its 12:00 AM time slot as part of Toonami. "", ""Dragon Ball Z uses four pieces of theme music in the Japanese version. From episodes 1–199, the opening theme is 'Cha-La Head-Cha-La' by Hironobu Kageyama, and the closing theme is 'Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Pawā!' by MANNA. From episodes 200–291, the opening and closing themes are 'We Gotta Power' and 'Boku-Tachi wa Tenshi Datta,' both by Hironobu Kageyama. Series overview In Japan, Dragon Ball Z was aired year-round continuously, with regular off-days for sporting events and television specials taking place about once every six weeks on average. The English broadcast was divided into eight separate near-continuous blocks with breaks varying between four months to over a year between each block. Only in one instance, between episodes 194 and 195, was there actually parity between the DVD release and the actual broadcast sequence in terms of the end of one 'season' and the beginning of the next. "", ""Vegeta acknowledging his rival as he fought Kid Buu was a defining moment for Vegeta's character growth. The final Spirit Bomb that Goku launches on Kid Buu is also pretty great to witness in its own right. 3 Everyone Vs Frieza Episodes: 77-86 The Z Warriors put everything on the line to survive Frieza's relentless assault For what it’s worth, the fight against Frieza starts off well-paced enough in the anime. The first 8 episodes are dedicated to everything before Goku shows up, which actually does have a fair bit of material to adapt – perhaps not 8 episodes’ worth, but it’s not an unreasonable number when taking into account how much of an endurance match the battle with Frieza is. Problems start to arise when you look at the arc in perspective, however. Along with these initial 8 episodes, the final fight against Frieza lasts nearly 30 episodes in Dragon Ball Z. That’s over half a year of syndication for a single battle. In the grand scheme of things, it’s simply too much. "", 'The original Dragon Ball finds the perfect length that’s neither too cumbersome nor brief, which is appropriate as Toriyama tests the waters and sees what audiences think of this heightened world. Dragon Ball, as a manga, ran for 194 chapters, which has been compiled into 16 volumes. It’s a respectable length for a starter shonen series. Alternatively, Dragon Ball’s anime adaptation is 153 episodes and it doesn’t stray very far from its source material. There are a handful of filler episodes, but the Dragon Ball anime is quite faithful to its manga and doesn’t indulge in any wild detours. There was originally no official delineation between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z in Toriyama’s manga. Chapter 196 just kicked off with a five-year time-jump that ushers in Goku’s adult adventures, now with a family and young child. Dragon Ball saw plenty of success, but Dragon Ball Z catapulted this fame to new heights with a greater emphasis on action, ki-based combat, and powerful transformations. Dragon Ball Z is significantly longer than its predecessor and it makes up the majority of the Dragon Ball franchise. The manga ran for 325 chapters across 26 volumes, which brings it and the original Dragon Ball to a combined 519 chapters of material. Dragon Ball Z’s anime is also not one for brevity and it nearly doubles the original series’ episode count at 291. Dragon Ball Z doesn’t remove any of its manga’s storylines, but it does get more indulgent with filler material, particularly when it comes to extending fights. ', ""Dragon Ball Super changed fans' standard of quality. It also made them reconsider Dragon Ball GT and wonder whether it was a good show. Dragon Ball Super is the latest canonical Dragon Ball entry and it continues to turn out new content and contribute to the greater Dragon Ball lore. Dragon Ball Super was developed as an alternate sequel series to Dragon Ball Z that disregards Dragon Ball GT. However, Dragon Ball Super is curiously set right after Kid Buu’s defeat. This means that the entire series takes place before Dragon Ball Z’s Peaceful World Saga ending, which turns the clock forward ten years for its epilogue, which is set at the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament. Dragon Ball Super has crammed a tremendous amount into this ten-year window, even if some of it pushes the limits of incredulity. Dragon Ball Super produced 131 episodes before its relatively abrupt finale during the Tournament of Power’s conclusion.

13,13,"['All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Griel Field, Kennedy Field, Moton Field, Shorter Field, and the Tuskegee Army Air Fields. They were educated at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), located near Tuskegee, Alabama. Of the 922 pilots, five were Haitians from the Haitian Air Force and one pilot was from Trinidad. It also included an airman born in the Dominican Republic and one born in Jamaica. The 99th Pursuit Squadron (later the 99th Fighter Squadron) was the first black flying squadron, and the first to deploy overseas (to North Africa in April 1943, and later to Sicily and other parts of Italy). The 332nd Fighter Group, which originally included the 100th, 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons, was the first black flying group. It deployed to Italy in early 1944. Although the 477th Bombardment Group trained with North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, they never served in combat. In June 1944, the 332nd Fighter Group began flying heavy bomber escort missions and, in July 1944, with the addition of the 99th Fighter Squadron, it had four fighter squadrons. ', 'The U.S. Army Air Corps had established the Psychological Research Unit 1 at Maxwell Army Air Field, Montgomery, Alabama, and other units around the country for aviation cadet training, which included the identification, selection, education, and training of pilots, navigators and bombardiers. Psychologists employed in these research studies and training programs used some of the first standardized tests to quantify IQ, dexterity, and leadership qualities to select and train the best-suited personnel for the roles of bombardier, navigator, and pilot. The Air Corps determined that the existing programs would be used for all units, including all-black units. At Tuskegee, this effort continued with the selection and training of the Tuskegee Airmen. The War Department set up a system to accept only those with a level of flight experience or higher education which ensured that only the ablest and most intelligent African-American applicants were able to join.[citation needed] ', ""A group of 271 enlisted men began training in aircraft ground support trades at Chanute Field in March 1941 until they were transferred to bases in Alabama in July 1941. The skills being taught were so technical that setting up segregated classes was deemed impossible. This small number of enlisted men became the core of other black squadrons forming at Tuskegee Fields in Alabama. While the enlisted men were in training, five black youths were admitted to the Officers Training School (OTS) at Chanute Field as aviation cadets. Specifically, Elmer D. Jones, Dudley Stevenson, and James Johnson of Washington, DC; Nelson Brooks of Illinois, and William R. Thompson of Pittsburgh, PA successfully completed OTS and were commissioned as the first Black Army Air Corps Officers. In June 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was transferred to Tuskegee, Alabama, and remained the only black flying unit in the country, but did not yet have pilots. The famous airmen were actually trained at five airfields surrounding Tuskegee University (formerly Tuskegee Institute)--Griel, Kennedy, Moton, Shorter, and Tuskegee Army Air Fields. The flying unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men and was backed by an entire service arm. On 19 July 1941, thirteen individuals made up the first class of aviation cadets (42-C) when they entered preflight training at Tuskegee Institute. After primary training at Moton Field, they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field, about 10 miles (16 km) to the west for conversion training onto operational types. Consequently, Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training (basic, advanced, and transition) at a single location. Initial planning called for 500 personnel in residence at a time. By mid-1942, over six times that many were stationed at Tuskegee, even though only two squadrons were training there. War Bonds poster featuring a Tuskegee Airman Tuskegee Army Airfield was similar to already-existing airfields reserved for training white pilots, such as Maxwell Field, only 40 miles (64 km) distant. African-American contractor McKissack and McKissack, Inc. was in charge of the contract. The company's 2,000 workmen, the Alabama Works Progress Administration, and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months. The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057. The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis Jr., one of only two black line officers then serving. During training, Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison. Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee. However, he was transferred on 12 January 1942, reputedly because of his insistence that his African-American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local white civilians.

God sees us as a reflection of himself, images of God. God sees us as beloved children, brothers and sisters of his own Son Jesus Christ. God sees us and says, in the words of Psalm 139, that we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made.' Jesus provides for that.

Not release just from guilt and wallowing in self-pity. Release from the fact that sin can define us at all. Sin is not how God sees us. God sees us as a reflection of himself, images of God. God sees us as beloved children, brothers and sisters of his own Son Jesus Christ. God sees us and says, in the words of Psalm 139, that we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made.' Jesus provides for that. One of the big things that happened on the cross was this: sin no longer defines who we are in God’s eyes. God looks at us and says, just as he did to the woman at the well, 'Go, and sin no more…I forgive your iniquity and remember your sins no more.'

']","[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_to_the_World_(Three_Dog_Night_song)\n'\x1b[92m[1] Joy to the World\x1b[0m' is a song written by Hoyt Axton and made famous by the band Three Dog Night. The song is also popularly known by its opening lyric, '\x1b[92m[6] Jeremiah was a bullfrog\x1b[0m'. Three Dog Night originally released the song on their fourth studio album, Naturally, in November 1970, and subsequently released an edited version of the song as a single in February 1971. The song, which has been described by members of Three Dog Night as a '\x1b[92m[2] kid's song\x1b[0m' and a '\x1b[92m[3] silly song\x1b[0m', topped the singles charts in North America, was certified gold by the RIAA, and has since been covered by multiple artists. Background and recording Some of the words are nonsensical. Axton wanted to persuade his record producers to record a new melody he had written, and the producers asked him to sing any words to the tune. A member of Three Dog Night said that the original lyrics to the song were '\x1b[92m[4] Jeremiah was a prophet\x1b[0m' but \x1b[92m[5] no one liked it\x1b[0m. "", ""https://oxfordamerican.org/web-only/the-big-chill-forrest-gump-soundtrack\nThe only song that appears in both The Big Chill (1983) and Forrest Gump (1994) is Three Dog Night’s exuberant 'Joy to the World,' whose delirious mash-up of \x1b[95m[7] Biblical allusions, anti-war rhetoric and free-love bawdiness\x1b[0m made it a kind of consensus hit in culturally polarized times: in terms of sales and airplay, it was the biggest song of 1971. Where Three Dog Night was a pure El Lay band, 'Joy to the World' was written by an Oklahoman, Hoyt Axton, whose mother Mae actually co-wrote 'Heartbreak Hotel' for Elvis Presley—a coincidence that recalls the (obviously speculative) scene in Forrest Gump where the King is shown honing his craft in an Alabama boarding-house room. 'Joy to the World'’s appearance in Gump is relatively unimportant: it plays behind scenes of the hero practicing ping-pong diplomacy in front of an enormous mural of Chairman Mao—a bit of classic-rock patriotism. But its use as an overture in The Big Chill—sung hoarsely at bath time by a young child right before his Dad gets some bad news via telephone—is suggestive: the sound of a cozy, insular bubble bursting.

16,11,"[""Reading Football Club (/ˈrɛdɪŋ/ ⓘ RED-ing) is a professional football club based in Reading, Berkshire, England. They compete in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system. They play their home matches at the Select Car Leasing Stadium. Reading are nicknamed The Royals, due to Reading's location in the Royal County of Berkshire, though they were previously known as The Biscuitmen, due to the town's association with biscuit maker Huntley & Palmers. Established in 1871, the club is one of the oldest teams in England, but did not join The Football League until 1920, and first played in the top tier of English football league system in the 2006–07 season. The club competed in the 2012–13 Premier League season, having gained promotion at the end of the 2011–12 season after winning the Championship, but were relegated after just one season back in the top flight. Reading won the 1987–88 Full Members' Cup and were one of only two Second Division clubs to lift the trophy, beating Luton Town 4–1 in the final at Wembley. The club's best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the semi-finals which they achieved twice: in 1926–27 and 2014–15. The club played at Elm Park for 102 years, from 1896 to 1998. In 1998, the club moved to the new Madejski Stadium, which was named after the club's former chairman Sir John Madejski. In 2021, the club announced that the ground would be known as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the subsequent decade for sponsorship reasons. "", ""Reading started the 2008–09 season with a 15 match unbeaten home run. They finished fourth and qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Burnley in the semi-final. Manager Steve Coppell resigned just hours after the game, replaced by Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009 and Brian McDermott made caretaker manager the same day. In the 2010–11 FA Cup, Reading reached the quarter-final, where they lost 1–0 to Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, Reading eventually finished fifth in the Championship to qualify for the division's play-offs. After beating Cardiff City in the semi-finals, they lost 4–2 to Swansea City in the final at Wembley. In the 2011–12 season, a streak of good form in the second half of the season, ensured promotion back to the Premier League on 17 April 2012 with 1–0 home win against Nottingham Forest. "", ""In the summer leading up to the 2016–17 season the club announced the departure of Brian McDermott and eventually he was to be replaced by former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam. Under Stam, Reading achieved their highest finish since relegation back to the Championship by finishing third and reaching the play-offs, where they beat Fulham on aggregate before facing Huddersfield Town in the final at Wembley where they lost on penalties following 0–0 draw after extra time. In 2017, Chinese investors Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li acquired the club. The team languished towards the bottom of the table for most of the 2017–18 season. On 21 March 2018, Stam resigned as manager after a nine-game winless run. Two days later, on 23 March 2018, Paul Clement was appointed as Reading's new manager; the club finished the season in 20th place, avoiding relegation by three points. "", ""On 17 November 2021 it was confirmed Reading would be deducted six points due to breaching the EFL's profitability and sustainability rules. Over five years, the club reported pre-tax losses of £146m, way beyond the EFL's limit of a £13m annual pre-tax loss. In 2021, the club spent 234% of its revenue on player wages. Following a 3–2 away victory over Preston North End in February 2022, manager Veljko Paunović left by mutual consent, with Paul Ince being placed in interim charge of the team alongside academy manager Michael Gilkes. On 16 May, Ince became the team's permanent manager, with Mark Bowen returning as head of football operations. "", ""In June 2023, Reading were charged by the EFL with failing to pay their players on time and in full, in October and November 2022, and April 2023, and with non-payment of taxes - charges that meant Reading might start their 2023–24 League One season with a points deduction. Following the EFL's action, Reading fans groups united to launch a campaign, Sell Before We Dai, urging owner Dai Yongge to sell the club, calling his stewardship 'an unmitigated disaster' and citing the club's 'excruciating financial losses'. On 27 June, Reading were served a winding-up petition by HMRC over the unpaid tax bills, with a hearing set for 9 August (on 12 July, football finance expert Kieran Maguire described the club's ownership as 'a car crash'). On 28 July, the club was placed under another transfer embargo because of the unpaid taxes. On 2 August, Dai Yongge was reported to be seeking new investors to bring financial stability to the club. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2023, Reading announced the provisional appointment of Rubén Sellés as their new manager, confirmed on 14 July, after his visa application was successful. On 16 August 2023, after one win and two defeats in their opening three league fixtures, Reading had a point deducted (their third deduction in three consecutive seasons), and a further three-point deduction suspended, for its failures to pay players fully and on time during the 2022–23 season. Dai Yongge was ordered to pay 125% of the club's forecast monthly wages into a designated account. Failure to comply, or not paying wages on time up to 30 June 2024, would activate the suspended penalty; the three-point deduction was applied on 13 September, and Dai Yongge faced a misconduct charge. On 29 September 2023, Dai Yongge said he was open to 'credible offers of interest' to buy the club after another transfer embargo was imposed in respect to an outstanding tax bill. A 3–2 home defeat by Portsmouth on 28 October dropped the club to the bottom of League One on six points, eight from safety; the match was preceded by a fans protest against Dai Yongge's ownership. On 31 October, the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. On 1 November, Reading were referred to an EFL independent disciplinary commission regarding unpaid HMRC debts owed in September and October 2023. On 9 November, a sale of the club was reported to be progressing, and the latest winding-up petition and transfer embargo had been resolved. On 19 December 2023, Dai Yongge was fined £20,000 for Reading's wages failures; the EFL had recommended a 12-month ban from all football activities, but an independent disciplinary commission opted not to enforce it. A further £50,000 fine was suspended until 12 January 2024, and was triggered after Dai Yongge again failed to make the required full wage deposits. On 27 February 2024, Reading received their second points deduction of the season, being docked two more points by the EFL after failing to make HMRC payments within an 80-day limit. The deduction left the club three points above the relegation places. In total, under Dai Yongge's ownership, the club has had 18 points deducted. In March 2024, Dai Yongge was 'open to the sale' of the club's Bearwood Park training facility to secure funding while new owners were sought, a move criticised by supporters groups for the confusing message it sent to potential investors; the club faces a cash shortfall of about £1m for March. On 14 March, Reading announced they were holding talks with Wycombe Wanderers over the sale of Bearwood Park, but Wycombe put the talks 'on hold' after learning that 'planning limitations allowed only Reading to use the grounds'.

Installation of a Speed Feedback sign is optional, but if used it should be installed in conjunction with a Speed Limit sign.15 Speed Feedback signs are particularly useful at speed reductions where drivers have been traveling for some time at a higher speed. The phenomenon known as 'speed adaptation' causes drivers to underestimate their actual operating speeds in these instances, and the Speed Feedback sign can assist them in achieving the necessary speed reduction. Speed Feedback signs may be permanent or temporary installations. However, permanent installations are usually restricted to selected locations since a proliferation of Speed Feedback signs could lessen the effectiveness of the signs when they are needed most.

The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when special hazards exist with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. Speed must be decreased as necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway. Enforcement The Illinois State Police utilizes hand-held radar, moving radar, pacing, laser speed measurement devices, photo speed enforcement and air speed measurement to determine the speed of vehicles. The first mechanical means to measure vehicle speed was the stop watch. As early as 1906 the courts accepted that the time it took a vehicle to travel between two points ', '*Please note that statutory speed limits only exist in the absence of special speed regulations. If a special speed regulation exists, that posted speed limit will always supersede a statutory speed limit within a thickly settled or business district. Advisory Speeds: Speeds that are recommended safe driving speeds to alert drivers of the maximum recommended speed through a curve, a winding road, or for other special road conditions.  Advisory speeds are not enforceable since their intent is to advise motorists of an appropriate speed, not regulate it. Work Zone Speed Limits: Speed limits within construction work zones are set to improve traffic flow and improve safety for motorists and construction personnel.  Reduced speed limits are based on conditions such as lane closures, narrow lanes, unexpected changes to geometry, and other potential hazards.  Speeding violations in work zones are subject to double fines. ', ""Digital speed limit signs have replaced some standard speed signs in Oregon. The digital signs use road, weather, traffic and visibility sensors to lower the speed limit when conditions require drivers to slow down. The digital displays may also show the reason for a reduced speed. There are two types of digital variable speed signs: Variable Advisory Speed: Variable advisory speed signs are yellow and say, 'advisory speed.' These signs recommend a speed based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). These signs are turned on and off as needed. These are not speed limits, but police may enforce them through the basic rule law. Variable Speed Limit: Variable speed limit signs are black and white and say, 'speed limit.' These signs change the speed limit based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). Police may enforce these signs like any other speed limit sign.Variable speed signs, based on specific conditions, work to improve safety and reduce the chance of a collision by: Improving Line of Sight: In poor weather conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, or snow, slower speeds give drivers more time to react to obstacles or hazards that may be difficult to see.

You must obey all pavement markings unless you see a police officer or road worker redirecting traffic. Yellow MarkingsAre used to separate traffic moving in opposite directions (center line) and to mark the left edge of one-way roads and ramps, two-way left turn lanes, and painted medians. Solid yellow lineMarks the left edge of one-way roads and ramps. Broken yellow center lineIndicates a two-way road used for traffic traveling in opposite directions. Passing is allowed for both directions of travel. Double center line consisting of a solid yellow line and broken yellow lineIndicates where passing is allowed. A broken yellow line on your side of the lane indicates you are allowed to pass. A solid yellow line on your side of the lane indicates you are not allowed to pass. ', 'Speed limits between 25 and 55 mph may be established on the basis of traffic engineering studies. These studies include roadway conditions, accident records and the prevailing speed of prudent drivers. If an unreasonably low speed is posted, most drivers will ignore the signs, while a few may try to stay within the posted speed limit. This causes real safety concerns because of the difference between faster and slower drivers. Setting unrealistically low speed limits... ... has two adverse effects. They make violators out of reasonable and otherwise law-abiding citizens. Most importantly, police enforcement is diminished, which plays a vital role in controlling the speed limit. Unrealistic speed limits create a difficult situation for the police and the community and citations are not upheld in court. Often the police will not return to the site to reinforce the law.

In general, Standard Highway Signs states that signs for regulatory speed zones shall be of the appropriate design—including size, text, and color.33 The MUTCD states that the speed limits shown shall be in multiples of 5 mph (8 km/h).15 ', ""https://highways.dot.gov/safety/speed-management/methods-and-practices-setting-speed-limits-informational-report/speed-1\nIf used, the changeable message sign legend should be 'YOUR SPEED XX MPH' or similar wording. The legend should be yellow on a black background or the reverse of these colors. Installation of a Speed Feedback sign is optional, but if used it should be installed in conjunction with a Speed Limit sign.15 Speed Feedback signs are particularly useful at speed reductions where drivers have been traveling for some time at a higher speed. The phenomenon known as 'speed adaptation' causes drivers to underestimate their actual operating speeds in these instances, and the Speed Feedback sign can assist them in achieving the necessary speed reduction. Speed Feedback signs may be permanent or temporary installations. However, permanent installations are usually restricted to selected locations since a proliferation of Speed Feedback signs could lessen the effectiveness of the signs when they are needed most.

Speed must be decreased as necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway.

Advisory Speeds: Speeds that are recommended safe driving speeds to alert drivers of the maximum recommended speed through a curve, a winding road, or for other special road conditions.  Advisory speeds are not enforceable since their intent is to advise motorists of an appropriate speed, not regulate it.

The digital signs use road, weather, traffic and visibility sensors to lower the speed limit when conditions require drivers to slow down. The digital displays may also show the reason for a reduced speed. There are two types of digital variable speed signs: Variable Advisory Speed: Variable advisory speed signs are yellow and say, 'advisory speed.' These signs recommend a speed based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). These signs are turned on and off as needed. These are not speed limits, but police may enforce them through the basic rule law. Variable Speed Limit: Variable speed limit signs are black and white and say, 'speed limit.' These signs change the speed limit based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). Police may enforce these signs like any other speed limit sign.Variable speed signs, based on specific conditions, work to improve safety and reduce the chance of a collision by: Improving Line of Sight: In poor weather conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, or snow, slower speeds give drivers more time to react to obstacles or hazards that may be difficult to see.

This causes real safety concerns because of the difference between faster and slower drivers. Setting unrealistically low speed limits... ... has two adverse effects. They make violators out of reasonable and otherwise law-abiding citizens. Most importantly, police enforcement is diminished, which plays a vital role in controlling the speed limit.

They compete in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system. They play their home matches at the Select Car Leasing Stadium. Reading are nicknamed The Royals, due to Reading's location in the Royal County of Berkshire, though they were previously known as The Biscuitmen, due to the town's association with biscuit maker Huntley & Palmers. Established in 1871, the club is one of the oldest teams in England, but did not join The Football League until 1920, and first played in the top tier of English football league system in the 2006–07 season. The club competed in the 2012–13 Premier League season, having gained promotion at the end of the 2011–12 season after winning the Championship, but were relegated after just one season back in the top flight. Reading won the 1987–88 Full Members' Cup and were one of only two Second Division clubs to lift the trophy, beating Luton Town 4–1 in the final at Wembley. The club's best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the semi-finals which they achieved twice: in 1926–27 and 2014–15. The club played at Elm Park for 102 years, from 1896 to 1998. In 1998, the club moved to the new Madejski Stadium, which was named after the club's former chairman Sir John Madejski. In 2021, the club announced that the ground would be known as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the subsequent decade for sponsorship reasons. "", ""Reading started the 2008–09 season with a 15 match unbeaten home run. They finished fourth and qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Burnley in the semi-final. Manager Steve Coppell resigned just hours after the game, replaced by Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009 and Brian McDermott made caretaker manager the same day. In the 2010–11 FA Cup, Reading reached the quarter-final, where they lost 1–0 to Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, Reading eventually finished fifth in the Championship to qualify for the division's play-offs. After beating Cardiff City in the semi-finals, they lost 4–2 to Swansea City in the final at Wembley. In the 2011–12 season, a streak of good form in the second half of the season, ensured promotion back to the Premier League on 17 April 2012 with 1–0 home win against Nottingham Forest. "", ""In the summer leading up to the 2016–17 season the club announced the departure of Brian McDermott and eventually he was to be replaced by former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam. Under Stam, Reading achieved their highest finish since relegation back to the Championship by finishing third and reaching the play-offs, where they beat Fulham on aggregate before facing Huddersfield Town in the final at Wembley where they lost on penalties following 0–0 draw after extra time. In 2017, Chinese investors Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li acquired the club. The team languished towards the bottom of the table for most of the 2017–18 season. On 21 March 2018, Stam resigned as manager after a nine-game winless run. Two days later, on 23 March 2018, Paul Clement was appointed as Reading's new manager; the club finished the season in 20th place, avoiding relegation by three points. "", ""On 17 November 2021 it was confirmed Reading would be deducted six points due to breaching the EFL's profitability and sustainability rules. Over five years, the club reported pre-tax losses of £146m, way beyond the EFL's limit of a £13m annual pre-tax loss. In 2021, the club spent 234% of its revenue on player wages. Following a 3–2 away victory over Preston North End in February 2022, manager Veljko Paunović left by mutual consent, with Paul Ince being placed in interim charge of the team alongside academy manager Michael Gilkes. On 16 May, Ince became the team's permanent manager, with Mark Bowen returning as head of football operations. "", ""In June 2023, Reading were charged by the EFL with failing to pay their players on time and in full, in October and November 2022, and April 2023, and with non-payment of taxes - charges that meant Reading might start their 2023–24 League One season with a points deduction. Following the EFL's action, Reading fans groups united to launch a campaign, Sell Before We Dai, urging owner Dai Yongge to sell the club, calling his stewardship 'an unmitigated disaster' and citing the club's 'excruciating financial losses'. On 27 June, Reading were served a winding-up petition by HMRC over the unpaid tax bills, with a hearing set for 9 August (on 12 July, football finance expert Kieran Maguire described the club's ownership as 'a car crash'). On 28 July, the club was placed under another transfer embargo because of the unpaid taxes. On 2 August, Dai Yongge was reported to be seeking new investors to bring financial stability to the club. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2023, Reading announced the provisional appointment of Rubén Sellés as their new manager, confirmed on 14 July, after his visa application was successful. On 16 August 2023, after one win and two defeats in their opening three league fixtures, Reading had a point deducted (their third deduction in three consecutive seasons), and a further three-point deduction suspended, for its failures to pay players fully and on time during the 2022–23 season. Dai Yongge was ordered to pay 125% of the club's forecast monthly wages into a designated account. Failure to comply, or not paying wages on time up to 30 June 2024, would activate the suspended penalty; the three-point deduction was applied on 13 September, and Dai Yongge faced a misconduct charge. On 29 September 2023, Dai Yongge said he was open to 'credible offers of interest' to buy the club after another transfer embargo was imposed in respect to an outstanding tax bill. A 3–2 home defeat by Portsmouth on 28 October dropped the club to the bottom of League One on six points, eight from safety; the match was preceded by a fans protest against Dai Yongge's ownership. On 31 October, the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. On 1 November, Reading were referred to an EFL independent disciplinary commission regarding unpaid HMRC debts owed in September and October 2023. On 9 November, a sale of the club was reported to be progressing, and the latest winding-up petition and transfer embargo had been resolved. On 19 December 2023, Dai Yongge was fined £20,000 for Reading's wages failures; the EFL had recommended a 12-month ban from all football activities, but an independent disciplinary commission opted not to enforce it. A further £50,000 fine was suspended until 12 January 2024, and was triggered after Dai Yongge again failed to make the required full wage deposits. On 27 February 2024, Reading received their second points deduction of the season, being docked two more points by the EFL after failing to make HMRC payments within an 80-day limit. The deduction left the club three points above the relegation places. In total, under Dai Yongge's ownership, the club has had 18 points deducted. In March 2024, Dai Yongge was 'open to the sale' of the club's Bearwood Park training facility to secure funding while new owners were sought, a move criticised by supporters groups for the confusing message it sent to potential investors; the club faces a cash shortfall of about £1m for March.

19,25,"[""Diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian, and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale. Eyes vary in their visual acuity, the range of wavelengths they can detect, their sensitivity in no light, their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects, and whether they can discriminate colours. History of research The human eye, showing the iris and pupil In 1802, philosopher William Paley called it a miracle of 'design.' In 1859, Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species, that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance 'absurd in the highest possible degree'. However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible: "", ""Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors. Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classic paper that only a few hundred thousand generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates. Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through. All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory. Rate of evolution The first possible fossils of eyes found to date are from the Ediacaran period (about 555 million years ago), while the oldest certain fossilized eye is from a Schmidtiellus reetae fossil from 530 mya, collected in Saviranna in northern Estonia. The structure is similar to the compound eyes of modern-day dragonflies and bees, but with (~100) ommatidia spaced further apart, and without a lens. The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the 'Cambrian explosion'. One of the many hypotheses for 'causes' of the Cambrian explosion is the 'Light Switch' theory of Andrew Parker: it holds that the evolution of advanced eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution. Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision. The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate because the fossil record, particularly of the lower Cambrian, is poor. How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells can evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation, relative advantage to the organism, and natural selection. However, the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year, which is common in small animals. Even with these pessimistic values, the vertebrate eye could still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years.[note 1] Origins of the eye Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye. All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development. This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light-sensitive machinery – even if it was not a dedicated optical organ. However, even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells. Probably, photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion. Higher-level similarities – such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses – reflect the co-option of a more fundamental protein to a new function within the eye. A shared trait common to all light-sensitive organs are opsins. Opsins belong to a family of photo-sensitive proteins and fall into nine groups, which already existed in the urbilaterian, the last common ancestor of all bilaterally symmetrical animals. Additionally, the genetic toolkit for positioning eyes is shared by all animals: The PAX6 gene controls where eyes develop in animals ranging from octopuses to mice and fruit flies. Such high-level genes are, by implication, much older than many of the structures that they control today; they must originally have served a different purpose, before they were co-opted for eye development. Eyes and other sensory organs probably evolved before the brain: There is no need for an information-processing organ (brain) before there is information to process. A living example are cubozoan jellyfish that possess eyes comparable to vertebrate and cephalopod camera eyes despite lacking a brain. Stages of evolution "", ""Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation. Vision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes. However, how this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism's environment varies widely: eyes have a wide range of structures and forms, all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules. At a cellular level, there appear to be two main types of eyes, one possessed by the protostomes (molluscs, annelid worms and arthropods), the other by the deuterostomes (chordates and echinoderms). "", ""The basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules bound to each other and located in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein; and a chromophore, the pigment that absorbs light. Groups of such cells are termed 'eyespots', and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings. Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species. The planarian has 'cup' eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction. These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup, which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions, then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened. While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light, as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo-sensitive cells regardless of its direction, the 'cup' shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light's angle. Pit eyes, which had arisen by the Cambrian period, were seen in ancient snails,[clarification needed] and are found in some snails and other invertebrates living today, such as planaria. Planaria can slightly differentiate the direction and intensity of light because of their cup-shaped, heavily pigmented retina cells, which shield the light-sensitive cells from exposure in all directions except for the single opening for the light. However, this proto-eye is still much more useful for detecting the absence or presence of light than its direction; this gradually changes as the eye's pit deepens and the number of photoreceptive cells grows, allowing for increasingly precise visual information. When a photon is absorbed by the chromophore, a chemical reaction causes the photon's energy to be transduced into electrical energy and relayed, in higher animals, to the nervous system. These photoreceptor cells form part of the retina, a thin layer of cells that relays visual information, including the light and day-length information needed by the circadian rhythm system, to the brain. However, some jellyfish, such as Cladonema (Cladonematidae), have elaborate eyes but no brain. Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain. During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction.

History of research The human eye, showing the iris and pupil In 1802, philosopher William Paley called it a miracle of 'design.' In 1859, Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species, that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance 'absurd in the highest possible degree'. However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible: "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye\nBiologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors. Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classic paper that only a few hundred thousand generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates. Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through. All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory. Rate of evolution The first possible fossils of eyes found to date are from the Ediacaran period (about 555 million years ago), while the oldest certain fossilized eye is from a Schmidtiellus reetae fossil from 530 mya, collected in Saviranna in northern Estonia.

Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. "", ""Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is silvery-white. In air it oxidizes to lithium oxide. Its melting point of 180.50 °C (453.65 K; 356.90 °F) and its boiling point of 1,342 °C (1,615 K; 2,448 °F) are each the highest of all the alkali metals while its density of 0.534 g/cm3 is the lowest. Lithium has a very low density (0.534 g/cm3), comparable with pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is more than 60% denser. Apart from helium and hydrogen, as a solid it is less dense than any other element as a liquid, being only two-thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium. Lithium floating in oil Lithium's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures. Lithium has a mass specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin, the highest of all solids. Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications. Isotopes Main article: Isotopes of lithium Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (95.15% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than hydrogen-1, deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s. The 6Li isotope is one of only five stable nuclides to have both an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons, the other four stable odd-odd nuclides being hydrogen-2, boron-10, nitrogen-14, and tantalum-180m.

Lepidolite and spodumene are other common minerals which contain lithium. Commercial quantities of these three minerals are found in a special igneous rock deposit that geologists call pegmatite. In pegmatites, magma cools so slowly that crystals have time to grow very large. Because lepidolite is a type of mica, its crystals grow into long thin sheets.

Lithium batteries are proving to be an effective and affordable alternative to traditional batteries, and also used in new battery applications.  More than 80% of lithium mined is used in batteries.  This use has recently increased rapidly spurring an increase in lithium mining to provide the lithium for batteries. Lithium is mixed with other light metals such as aluminum and magnesium to form strong, light-weight alloys (an alloy is a mixture of metals).

It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl(Si2O5)2, lepidolite K(Li,Al)3(Al,Si,Rb)4O10(F,OH)2, spodumene LiAl(SiO3)2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world’s largest producers of lithium. Relation to Mining Lithium was first discovered in the mineral petalite. Lepidolite and spodumene are other common minerals which contain lithium. Commercial quantities of these three minerals are found in a special igneous rock deposit that geologists call pegmatite. In pegmatites, magma cools so slowly that crystals have time to grow very large. Because lepidolite is a type of mica, its crystals grow into long thin sheets. ', 'https://mineralseducationcoalition.org/minerals-database/lithium/\nLithium compounds are used in ceramics and glass, in primary aluminum production, in the manufacture of lubricants and greases, rocket propellants, vitamin A synthesis, silver solders, underwater buoyancy devices, and increasingly in batteries. Lithium batteries are proving to be an effective and affordable alternative to traditional batteries, and also used in new battery applications.  More than 80% of lithium mined is used in batteries.  This use has recently increased rapidly spurring an increase in lithium mining to provide the lithium for batteries. Lithium is mixed with other light metals such as aluminum and magnesium to form strong, light-weight alloys (an alloy is a mixture of metals). Some lithium, in the form of lithium carbonate or lithium citrate, is used as medicine to treat gout (an inflammation of joints) and to treat serious mental illness.

Demand for lithium-ion batteries has grown significantly in recent years, driving global exploration, and enabling new lithium projects to be considered. Batteries accounted for 80% of total demand in 2022. Also used in glass products, lithium increases the durability, corrosion resistance, and thermal resistance for use at extreme temperatures. It is used in such items as glass-ceramic stovetops, glass containers, specialty glass, and fibreglass. Because of its natural properties, lithium contributes to improved process productivity and energy savings in glassmaking. Lithium is a critical mineral for the energy transition and net-zero emissions will require greater reliance on both new and recycled sources of lithium for batteries. Lithium, global uses, 2022 Text version ', 'https://www.epa.gov/hw/lithium-ion-battery-recycling\nLithium-ion batteries are a type of commonly used rechargeable batteries that vary in size and design, but work in very similar ways. A battery is made of one or more cells, with each individual cell functioning to produce electricity. A cell contains an anode layer, a cathode layer, and a separator, all of which are in contact with an electrolyte, which is most often a liquid. These components are stacked or rolled together and placed in an outer packaging— typically either a steel can or an aluminum/polymer pouch material.

Natural abundance Lithium does not occur as the metal in nature, but is found combined in small amounts in nearly all igneous rocks and in the waters of many mineral springs. Spodumene, petalite, lepidolite, and amblygonite are the more important minerals containing lithium. Most lithium is currently produced in Chile, from brines that yield lithium carbonate when treated with sodium carbonate. The metal is produced by the electrolysis of molten lithium chloride and potassium chloride.

22,21,"[""What precisely is American federalism? In their seminal work on federal jurisdiction, Felix Frankfurter and Wilber Katz allude to a 'dynamic struggle' between federal and state power, the ebb and flow of competing, sometimes conflicting, spheres of federal and state power and influence. In many respects, the story of American government is the story of how that struggle has been resolved. The antecedents of American federalism trace to colonial days, when the concept of divided sovereign power began to take shape. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies declared themselves to be free and independent states.

In many respects, the story of American government is the story of how that struggle has been resolved. The antecedents of American federalism trace to colonial days, when the concept of divided sovereign power began to take shape.

Now, Tyler has shared more details about the recording of the song and making of the music video. In an interview with The Guardian, Tyler reveals the origins of the power ballad. '[Jim] told me he had started writing the song for a prospective musical version of Nosferatu years before, but never finished it,' she tells the outlet. 'We shot the video in a frightening gothic former asylum in Surrey. The guard dogs wouldn’t set foot in the rooms downstairs where they used to give people electric shock treatment.' The singer adds that she loved working with Steinman and was devastated when he died in 2021. She recalled their collaboration on 'Eclipse.' 'Recently a friend unearthed a letter I’d written to her from New York back then. It says: ‘I recorded an incredible song today. The trouble is, it’s so long, I don’t think anybody will ever play it,’' said Tyler.

24,25,"[""Diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian, and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale. Eyes vary in their visual acuity, the range of wavelengths they can detect, their sensitivity in no light, their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects, and whether they can discriminate colours. History of research The human eye, showing the iris and pupil In 1802, philosopher William Paley called it a miracle of 'design.' In 1859, Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species, that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance 'absurd in the highest possible degree'. However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible: "", ""Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors. Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classic paper that only a few hundred thousand generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates. Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through. All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory. Rate of evolution The first possible fossils of eyes found to date are from the Ediacaran period (about 555 million years ago), while the oldest certain fossilized eye is from a Schmidtiellus reetae fossil from 530 mya, collected in Saviranna in northern Estonia. The structure is similar to the compound eyes of modern-day dragonflies and bees, but with (~100) ommatidia spaced further apart, and without a lens. The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the 'Cambrian explosion'. One of the many hypotheses for 'causes' of the Cambrian explosion is the 'Light Switch' theory of Andrew Parker: it holds that the evolution of advanced eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution. Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision. The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate because the fossil record, particularly of the lower Cambrian, is poor. How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells can evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation, relative advantage to the organism, and natural selection. However, the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year, which is common in small animals. Even with these pessimistic values, the vertebrate eye could still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years.[note 1] Origins of the eye Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye. All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development. This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light-sensitive machinery – even if it was not a dedicated optical organ. However, even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells. Probably, photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion. Higher-level similarities – such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses – reflect the co-option of a more fundamental protein to a new function within the eye. A shared trait common to all light-sensitive organs are opsins. Opsins belong to a family of photo-sensitive proteins and fall into nine groups, which already existed in the urbilaterian, the last common ancestor of all bilaterally symmetrical animals. Additionally, the genetic toolkit for positioning eyes is shared by all animals: The PAX6 gene controls where eyes develop in animals ranging from octopuses to mice and fruit flies. Such high-level genes are, by implication, much older than many of the structures that they control today; they must originally have served a different purpose, before they were co-opted for eye development. Eyes and other sensory organs probably evolved before the brain: There is no need for an information-processing organ (brain) before there is information to process. A living example are cubozoan jellyfish that possess eyes comparable to vertebrate and cephalopod camera eyes despite lacking a brain. Stages of evolution "", ""Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation. Vision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes. However, how this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism's environment varies widely: eyes have a wide range of structures and forms, all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules. At a cellular level, there appear to be two main types of eyes, one possessed by the protostomes (molluscs, annelid worms and arthropods), the other by the deuterostomes (chordates and echinoderms). "", ""The basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules bound to each other and located in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein; and a chromophore, the pigment that absorbs light. Groups of such cells are termed 'eyespots', and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings. Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species. The planarian has 'cup' eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction. These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup, which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions, then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened. While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light, as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo-sensitive cells regardless of its direction, the 'cup' shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light's angle. Pit eyes, which had arisen by the Cambrian period, were seen in ancient snails,[clarification needed] and are found in some snails and other invertebrates living today, such as planaria. Planaria can slightly differentiate the direction and intensity of light because of their cup-shaped, heavily pigmented retina cells, which shield the light-sensitive cells from exposure in all directions except for the single opening for the light. However, this proto-eye is still much more useful for detecting the absence or presence of light than its direction; this gradually changes as the eye's pit deepens and the number of photoreceptive cells grows, allowing for increasingly precise visual information. When a photon is absorbed by the chromophore, a chemical reaction causes the photon's energy to be transduced into electrical energy and relayed, in higher animals, to the nervous system. These photoreceptor cells form part of the retina, a thin layer of cells that relays visual information, including the light and day-length information needed by the circadian rhythm system, to the brain. However, some jellyfish, such as Cladonema (Cladonematidae), have elaborate eyes but no brain. Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain. During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction. The nautilus eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera.

When a photon is absorbed by the chromophore, a chemical reaction causes the photon's energy to be transduced into electrical energy and relayed, in higher animals, to the nervous system. These photoreceptor cells form part of the retina, a thin layer of cells that relays visual information, including the light and day-length information needed by the circadian rhythm system, to the brain. However, some jellyfish, such as Cladonema (Cladonematidae), have elaborate eyes but no brain. Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain. During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction. The nautilus eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera. ""]","[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye\n\x1b[1;31;60m[1] The basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules bound to each other and located in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein; and a chromophore, the pigment that absorbs light\x1b[0m. \x1b[1;31;60m[2] Groups of such cells are termed 'eyespots', and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times\x1b[0m. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings. Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species. The planarian has 'cup' eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction. These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup, which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions, then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened. While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light, as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo-sensitive cells regardless of its direction, the 'cup' shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light's angle. Pit eyes, which had arisen by the Cambrian period, were seen in ancient snails,[clarification needed] and are found in some snails and other invertebrates living today, such as planaria. Planaria can slightly differentiate the direction and intensity of light because of their cup-shaped, heavily pigmented retina cells, which shield the light-sensitive cells from exposure in all directions except for the single opening for the light.

Season 2 and Season 5 took the team across the pond, where some filming took place in both France and Scotland since the treasure is believed to have been moved from the former to the latter prior to landing in Canada.

26,16,"[""The Job Safety Law of 1970: Its Passage Was Perilous Three decades ago Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to help protect the Nation's workers on the job, following a 3-year struggle. By Judson MacLaury On December 29, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed into law the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act, which gave the Federal Government the authority to set and enforce safety and health standards for most of the country's workers.1 This act was the result of a hard fought legislative battle which began in 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson unsuccessfully sought a similar measure. However, the roots of government regulation of workplace hazards date back to the late 19th century. State Factory Laws "", ""The labyrinth of State job safety and health legislation covered a wide range of workplace hazards but was badly flawed. There were too many holes in the piecemeal system and numerous hazards were left uncontrolled. The laws had to be amended often to cover new hazards. Many legislatures failed to provide adequate funds for enforcement. Inspectors, who were often political appointees, were not always given the legal right to enter workplaces. State with strong safety and health laws tended to lose industry to those with less stringent ones, which made States competitive and limited their legislative efforts. The Progressive Era and the growth of mass circulation newspapers and national magazines helped forge a national movement for workers' safety and health. In 1907, 362 coal miners were killed at Monongah, W. Va., in the worst U.S. mine disaster. This widely publicized tragedy shocked the Nation and led to the creation in 1910 of the U.S. Bureau of Mines to promote mine safety. That same year William B. Hard, a muckraking journalist, published an article in Everybody's Magazine titled, 'Making Steel and Killing Men,' based on his firsthand investigations of a Chicago mill.3 Hard estimated that every year, out of a work force of 10,000 workers, 1,200 were killed or seriously injured. He urged the steel industry to use its technical knowledge to reduce this casualty rate. U.S. Steel, spurred by mounting accident tolls, had already begun to collect accident statistics. Safety programs in subsidiaries dated back to the 1890's. In 1908, U.S. Steel formed a safety committee with instructions from the company president, Judge Elbert Gary, to cut the accident rate as much as possible. A highly successful 'safety first' movement developed from this which spilled over to other industries and led to the creation of the National Safety Council in 1915.4 "", ""Years before the Pittsburgh Survey, the idea of compensating injured workers from an insurance fund to which employers would contribute had gained a foothold in this country, though it was not at first promoted as a preventive measure. Prince Otto von Bismarck had initiated the first workers' compensation program in Germany in 1884, and the idea soon spread throughout Europe. In the United States, a few States tried to establish early compensation systems. Organized labor successfully opposed the concept, precisely because it was intended as a palliative, not a preventive measure. In 1908, Congress passed, with President Theodore Roosevelt's support, a limited workers' compensation law for Federal employees. Encouraged by this example, several States appointed study commissions. However, until the Pittsburgh Survey, compensation was treated mainly as a humanitarian measure.

The lyrics to 'Wade in the Water' were first co-published in 1901 in New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers by Frederick J. Work and his brother, John Wesley Work Jr., an educator at the historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, Fisk University.

Wade in the water Wade in the water, children Wade in the water God's gonna trouble the water "", ""Song MeaningWhatever the command 'Wade in the water!' means, the speaker really wants it to happen, and for children too, since it is repeated several times. The warning/notification 'God's a-gonna trouble the water' also happens repeatedly. Two primary interpretations: 'Wade in the water' means escape from slavery (which might require literally wading in the water to save one's skin). A modern day version is to advocate for Black civil rights. 'God's agonna trouble the water' means there could be negative consequences of this. 'Wade in the water' means the escape of the Israelites from the Egyptians via the Red Sea in the book of Exodus. 'God's agonna trouble the water' means once the Israelites have escaped and the Egyptians have followed God will make the sea fallback and destroy the Egyptians. "", ""‘Wade in the Water’ originated in the southern US in the mid-1800s, as a spiritual sung by enslaved African-Americans. In those communities, spirituals were more than just expressions of religious devotion. Some spirituals would be sung to alert freedom-seekers when it was safest to escape, without slaveholders ('masters') knowing that information was being communicated.  The lyrics of ‘Wade in the Water’ reference the Biblical story of the Israelites crossing the river Jordan, but the lyrics also remind those seeking freedom to walk in the rivers along their journey, so that tracking dogs and slave-catchers could not follow their footprints or their scent. ‘Wade in the Water’ became one of the best-known spirituals in the African-American community, but it wasn’t more broadly known until it was performed by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. This a capella group was formed at Fisk University in Nashville, established in 1867 to educate freed men and women. In 1871, the Singers were sent on a US tour to raise money for the financially struggling university. That November, they appeared at a national convention of ministers, where, according to their website, '[a]fter a few standard ballads the chorus sang spirituals and other songs associated with slavery. It was one of the first public performances of the secret music African-Americans sang in the fields and behind closed doors for generations.' Further tours by the Singers, including trips to Europe and Australia, and the publication of the song’s music and lyrics in the early 1900s took ‘Wade in the Water’ to even larger national and international audiences. The song was first recorded in ‘25 by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers, and was performed and recorded by many other gospel and spiritual singing groups in the early part of the 20th century, in addition to being a popular hymn in African-American churches. But it gradually became part of popular music as well. At the dawn of the 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained momentum in the US, there was a revival of interest in traditional folk music and in African-American culture. That made ‘Wade in the Water’ part of the soundtrack to that turbulent decade – both as a vocal number and as an instrumental. "", ""'Wade in the Water' entered the soul-jazz repertory in the late 1950s. When musicians took to quoting the first bars of the melody while soloing on other tunes, they were alluding to the song’s coded past life, using it as a signifier to the hip and racially conscious. The first modern jazz recording was a swaggering arrangement by Johnny Griffin’s Big Soul Band in 1960. By 1965, Graham Bond had hold of the song: the album version was short, but live it could take 10 minutes before Jack Bruce on bass and drummer Ginger Baker slammed in with gritty R&B and a template for heavy rock trio Cream. ArtsThe Life of a Song: Wade in the Water A year later the opening brass fanfare, driving tambourine, soul-stirring handclap and joyful piano of the Ramsey Lewis Trio’s million-selling version became a longstanding club classic and a northern soul staple. "", ""The song 'Wade In The Water' is a traditional African American spiritual with deep historical roots. The lyrics convey a message of deliverance and redemption, using the metaphor of water as a medium for change and divine intervention. The repeated line 'God's gonna trouble the water' suggests that God will stir the waters of life, creating a path to freedom or a transformational challenge that must be faced. The reference to the children dressed in red 'must be the ones that Moses led' alludes to the biblical story of the Exodus, where Moses leads the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, which is a powerful symbol of liberation and hope for the African American slaves who originally sang this song.The spiritual is also believed to have had a practical application during the era of the Underground Railroad, where coded messages within the song provided guidance to escaping slaves. The instruction to 'wade in the water' could have been a directive to avoid being tracked by scent dogs. The mention of walking down the highway with 'nowhere to go' reflects the uncertainty and peril faced by those seeking freedom, yet the song remains resolute in its encouragement to keep moving forward, trusting in divine providence.The enduring legacy of 'Wade In The Water' lies in its ability to inspire and uplift. It has been interpreted and recorded by numerous artists over the years, each bringing their own perspective to this powerful anthem. The song's themes of struggle, faith, and the quest for freedom resonate just as strongly today as they did in the past, making it a timeless piece of musical heritage. "", ""With that background, let us explore the use of Scripture in this spiritual and some theological themes these passages might represent. The refrain of 'Wade in the Water' is based upon the narrative of John 5:2-9. It is the story of the pool by the Sheep Gate—Bethzatha in Hebrew. A portion of this passage follows: 'Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had '(John 5:2-4, KJV) Perhaps, among other possibilities, this is a reference of healing in body and soul.

In those communities, spirituals were more than just expressions of religious devotion. Some spirituals would be sung to alert freedom-seekers when it was safest to escape, without slaveholders ('masters') knowing that information was being communicated.  The lyrics of \x1b[102m[4] ‘Wade in the Water’ reference the Biblical story of the Israelites crossing the river Jordan\x1b[0m, but \x1b[102m[5] the lyrics also remind those seeking freedom to walk in the rivers along their journey, so that tracking dogs and slave-catchers could not follow their footprints or their scent\x1b[0m. ‘Wade in the Water’ became one of the best-known spirituals in the African-American community, but it wasn’t more broadly known until it was performed by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. This a capella group was formed at Fisk University in Nashville, established in 1867 to educate freed men and women. In 1871, the Singers were sent on a US tour to raise money for the financially struggling university. That November, they appeared at a national convention of ministers, where, according to their website, '[a]fter a few standard ballads the chorus sang spirituals and other songs associated with slavery. It was one of the first public performances of the secret music African-Americans sang in the fields and behind closed doors for generations.' Further tours by the Singers, including trips to Europe and Australia, and the publication of the song’s music and lyrics in the early 1900s took ‘Wade in the Water’ to even larger national and international audiences. The song was first recorded in ‘25 by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers, and was performed and recorded by many other gospel and spiritual singing groups in the early part of the 20th century, in addition to being a popular hymn in African-American churches. But it gradually became part of popular music as well. At the dawn of the 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained momentum in the US, there was a revival of interest in traditional folk music and in African-American culture. That made ‘Wade in the Water’ part of the soundtrack to that turbulent decade – both as a vocal number and as an instrumental. "", ""https://www.ft.com/content/da800734-8f97-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78\n'Wade in the Water' entered the soul-jazz repertory in the late 1950s. When musicians took to quoting the first bars of the melody while soloing on other tunes, they were alluding to the song’s coded past life, using it as a signifier to the hip and racially conscious. The first modern jazz recording was a swaggering arrangement by Johnny Griffin’s Big Soul Band in 1960. By 1965, Graham Bond had hold of the song: the album version was short, but live it could take 10 minutes before Jack Bruce on bass and drummer Ginger Baker slammed in with gritty R&B and a template for heavy rock trio Cream. ArtsThe Life of a Song: Wade in the Water A year later the opening brass fanfare, driving tambourine, soul-stirring handclap and joyful piano of the Ramsey Lewis Trio’s million-selling version became a longstanding club classic and a northern soul staple. "", ""https://www.lyricslayers.com/spirituals/wade-in-the-water/\nThe song 'Wade In The Water' is a traditional African American spiritual with deep historical roots. The lyrics convey a message of deliverance and redemption, using the metaphor of water as a medium for change and divine intervention. The repeated line 'God's gonna trouble the water' suggests that God will stir the waters of life, creating a path to freedom or a transformational challenge that must be faced. The reference to the children dressed in red 'must be the ones that Moses led' alludes to the biblical story of the Exodus, where Moses leads the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, which is a powerful symbol of liberation and hope for the African American slaves who originally sang this song.The spiritual is also believed to have had a practical application during the era of the Underground Railroad, where coded messages within the song provided guidance to escaping slaves. The instruction to 'wade in the water' could have been a directive to avoid being tracked by scent dogs. The mention of walking down the highway with 'nowhere to go' reflects the uncertainty and peril faced by those seeking freedom, yet the song remains resolute in its encouragement to keep moving forward, trusting in divine providence.The enduring legacy of 'Wade In The Water' lies in its ability to inspire and uplift. It has been interpreted and recorded by numerous artists over the years, each bringing their own perspective to this powerful anthem. The song's themes of struggle, faith, and the quest for freedom resonate just as strongly today as they did in the past, making it a timeless piece of musical heritage. "", ""https://www.umcdiscipleship.org/resources/history-of-hymns-wade-in-the-water\nWith that background, let us explore the use of Scripture in this spiritual and some theological themes these passages might represent. The refrain of 'Wade in the Water' is based upon the narrative of John 5:2-9. It is the story of the pool by the Sheep Gate—Bethzatha in Hebrew. A portion of this passage follows: 'Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had '(John 5:2-4, KJV) Perhaps, among other possibilities, this is a reference of healing in body and soul. ""]","[""http://www.harriet-tubman.org/songs-of-the-underground-railroad/\nSongs used Biblical references and analogies of Biblical people, places and stories, comparing them to their own history of slavery. For example, 'being bound for the land of Canaan' for a white person could mean ready to die and go to heaven; but to a slave it meant ready to go to Canada. These are the lyrics of some songs that have been passed along for generations. \x1b[92m[1] In Wade in the Water Tubman used 'Wade in the Water' to tell slaves to get into the water to avoid being seen and make it through\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m[2] This is an example of a map song, where directions are coded into the lyrics\x1b[0m. These are the lyrics to 'Wade in the Water' Chorus: Wade in the Water, wade in the water children. Wade in the Water. God’s gonna trouble the water. Who are those children all dressed in Red? God’s gonna trouble the water. Must be the ones that Moses led. God’s gonna trouble the water. Chorus Who are those children all dressed in White? God’s gonna trouble the water.

30,17,"[""Songs used Biblical references and analogies of Biblical people, places and stories, comparing them to their own history of slavery. For example, 'being bound for the land of Canaan' for a white person could mean ready to die and go to heaven; but to a slave it meant ready to go to Canada. These are the lyrics of some songs that have been passed along for generations. In Wade in the Water Tubman used 'Wade in the Water' to tell slaves to get into the water to avoid being seen and make it through. This is an example of a map song, where directions are coded into the lyrics. These are the lyrics to 'Wade in the Water' Chorus: Wade in the Water, wade in the water children. Wade in the Water. God’s gonna trouble the water. Who are those children all dressed in Red? God’s gonna trouble the water. Must be the ones that Moses led. God’s gonna trouble the water. Chorus Who are those children all dressed in White? God’s gonna trouble the water. Must be the ones of the Israelites. "", ""'Wade in the Water' (Roud 5439) is an African American jubilee song, a spiritual—in reference to a genre of music 'created and first sung by African Americans in slavery.' The lyrics to 'Wade in the Water' were first co-published in 1901 in New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers by Frederick J. Work and his brother, John Wesley Work Jr., an educator at the historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, Fisk University. Work Jr. (1871–1925)—who is also known as John Work II—spent thirty years collecting, promoting, and reviving the songcraft of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers, which included being a member and director of the Fisk Jubilee Quartet. The Sunset Four Jubilee Singers made the first commercial recording of 'Wade in the Water' in 1925—released by Paramount Records. W. E. B. Du Bois called this genre of songs the Sorrow Songs. 'Wade in the Water' is associated with songs of the Underground Railroad. Fisk Jubilee Singers "", ""The full mixed choir became too expensive to tour, and was replaced by John Work II's male quartet. The quartet received 'widespread acclaim' and eventually made a series of best-selling recordings for Victor in December 1909, February 1911, for Edison in December 1911, for Columbia is October 1915 and February 1916, and Starr in 1916.:\u200a253 In the year that Work died, 1925, the first commercial recording of the song—performed by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers—was released by Paramount Records. In his 1925 book, Crisis, W. E. B. Du Bois mentioned 'Wade in the Water' as performed by the Norfolk Jubilee Quartet. DuBois wrote that 'You'll never tire of the melodious rich blended voices of the Norfolk Jubilee Quartet, Sunset Four, and Harrod's Jubilee Singers.':\u200a155,\u200a259 Lyrics The lyrics were first published in 1901 in New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. Wade in the water Wade in the water, children Wade in the water God's gonna trouble the water "", ""Song MeaningWhatever the command 'Wade in the water!' means, the speaker really wants it to happen, and for children too, since it is repeated several times. The warning/notification 'God's a-gonna trouble the water' also happens repeatedly. Two primary interpretations: 'Wade in the water' means escape from slavery (which might require literally wading in the water to save one's skin). A modern day version is to advocate for Black civil rights. 'God's agonna trouble the water' means there could be negative consequences of this. 'Wade in the water' means the escape of the Israelites from the Egyptians via the Red Sea in the book of Exodus. 'God's agonna trouble the water' means once the Israelites have escaped and the Egyptians have followed God will make the sea fallback and destroy the Egyptians. "", ""‘Wade in the Water’ originated in the southern US in the mid-1800s, as a spiritual sung by enslaved African-Americans. In those communities, spirituals were more than just expressions of religious devotion. Some spirituals would be sung to alert freedom-seekers when it was safest to escape, without slaveholders ('masters') knowing that information was being communicated.  The lyrics of ‘Wade in the Water’ reference the Biblical story of the Israelites crossing the river Jordan, but the lyrics also remind those seeking freedom to walk in the rivers along their journey, so that tracking dogs and slave-catchers could not follow their footprints or their scent. ‘Wade in the Water’ became one of the best-known spirituals in the African-American community, but it wasn’t more broadly known until it was performed by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. This a capella group was formed at Fisk University in Nashville, established in 1867 to educate freed men and women. In 1871, the Singers were sent on a US tour to raise money for the financially struggling university. That November, they appeared at a national convention of ministers, where, according to their website, '[a]fter a few standard ballads the chorus sang spirituals and other songs associated with slavery. It was one of the first public performances of the secret music African-Americans sang in the fields and behind closed doors for generations.' Further tours by the Singers, including trips to Europe and Australia, and the publication of the song’s music and lyrics in the early 1900s took ‘Wade in the Water’ to even larger national and international audiences. The song was first recorded in ‘25 by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers, and was performed and recorded by many other gospel and spiritual singing groups in the early part of the 20th century, in addition to being a popular hymn in African-American churches. But it gradually became part of popular music as well. At the dawn of the 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained momentum in the US, there was a revival of interest in traditional folk music and in African-American culture. That made ‘Wade in the Water’ part of the soundtrack to that turbulent decade – both as a vocal number and as an instrumental. "", ""'Wade in the Water' entered the soul-jazz repertory in the late 1950s. When musicians took to quoting the first bars of the melody while soloing on other tunes, they were alluding to the song’s coded past life, using it as a signifier to the hip and racially conscious. The first modern jazz recording was a swaggering arrangement by Johnny Griffin’s Big Soul Band in 1960. By 1965, Graham Bond had hold of the song: the album version was short, but live it could take 10 minutes before Jack Bruce on bass and drummer Ginger Baker slammed in with gritty R&B and a template for heavy rock trio Cream. ArtsThe Life of a Song: Wade in the Water A year later the opening brass fanfare, driving tambourine, soul-stirring handclap and joyful piano of the Ramsey Lewis Trio’s million-selling version became a longstanding club classic and a northern soul staple. "", ""The song 'Wade In The Water' is a traditional African American spiritual with deep historical roots. The lyrics convey a message of deliverance and redemption, using the metaphor of water as a medium for change and divine intervention. The repeated line 'God's gonna trouble the water' suggests that God will stir the waters of life, creating a path to freedom or a transformational challenge that must be faced. The reference to the children dressed in red 'must be the ones that Moses led' alludes to the biblical story of the Exodus, where Moses leads the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, which is a powerful symbol of liberation and hope for the African American slaves who originally sang this song.The spiritual is also believed to have had a practical application during the era of the Underground Railroad, where coded messages within the song provided guidance to escaping slaves. The instruction to 'wade in the water' could have been a directive to avoid being tracked by scent dogs. The mention of walking down the highway with 'nowhere to go' reflects the uncertainty and peril faced by those seeking freedom, yet the song remains resolute in its encouragement to keep moving forward, trusting in divine providence.The enduring legacy of 'Wade In The Water' lies in its ability to inspire and uplift. It has been interpreted and recorded by numerous artists over the years, each bringing their own perspective to this powerful anthem. The song's themes of struggle, faith, and the quest for freedom resonate just as strongly today as they did in the past, making it a timeless piece of musical heritage. "", ""With that background, let us explore the use of Scripture in this spiritual and some theological themes these passages might represent. The refrain of 'Wade in the Water' is based upon the narrative of John 5:2-9. It is the story of the pool by the Sheep Gate—Bethzatha in Hebrew. A portion of this passage follows: 'Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

"", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_in_the_Water\n'Wade in the Water' (Roud 5439) is an African American jubilee song, a spiritual—in reference to a genre of music 'created and first sung by African Americans in slavery.' The lyrics to 'Wade in the Water' were first co-published in 1901 in New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers by Frederick J. Work and his brother, John Wesley Work Jr., an educator at the historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, Fisk University. Work Jr. (1871–1925)—who is also known as John Work II—spent thirty years collecting, promoting, and reviving the songcraft of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers, which included being a member and director of the Fisk Jubilee Quartet. The Sunset Four Jubilee Singers made the first commercial recording of 'Wade in the Water' in 1925—released by Paramount Records. W. E. B. Du Bois called this genre of songs the Sorrow Songs. 'Wade in the Water' is associated with songs of the Underground Railroad. Fisk Jubilee Singers "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_in_the_Water\nThe full mixed choir became too expensive to tour, and was replaced by John Work II's male quartet. The quartet received 'widespread acclaim' and eventually made a series of best-selling recordings for Victor in December 1909, February 1911, for Edison in December 1911, for Columbia is October 1915 and February 1916, and Starr in 1916.:\u200a253 In the year that Work died, 1925, the first commercial recording of the song—performed by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers—was released by Paramount Records. In his 1925 book, Crisis, W. E. B. Du Bois mentioned 'Wade in the Water' as performed by the Norfolk Jubilee Quartet. DuBois wrote that 'You'll never tire of the melodious rich blended voices of the Norfolk Jubilee Quartet, Sunset Four, and Harrod's Jubilee Singers.':\u200a155,\u200a259 Lyrics The lyrics were first published in 1901 in New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

In those communities, spirituals were more than just expressions of religious devotion. Some spirituals would be sung to alert freedom-seekers when it was safest to escape, without slaveholders ('masters') knowing that information was being communicated.  The lyrics of \x1b[102m[4] ‘Wade in the Water’ reference the Biblical story of the Israelites crossing the river Jordan\x1b[0m, but \x1b[102m[5] the lyrics also remind those seeking freedom to walk in the rivers along their journey, so that tracking dogs and slave-catchers could not follow their footprints or their scent\x1b[0m. ‘Wade in the Water’ became one of the best-known spirituals in the African-American community, but it wasn’t more broadly known until it was performed by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. This a capella group was formed at Fisk University in Nashville, established in 1867 to educate freed men and women. In 1871, the Singers were sent on a US tour to raise money for the financially struggling university. That November, they appeared at a national convention of ministers, where, according to their website, '[a]fter a few standard ballads the chorus sang spirituals and other songs associated with slavery. It was one of the first public performances of the secret music African-Americans sang in the fields and behind closed doors for generations.' Further tours by the Singers, including trips to Europe and Australia, and the publication of the song’s music and lyrics in the early 1900s took ‘Wade in the Water’ to even larger national and international audiences. The song was first recorded in ‘25 by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers, and was performed and recorded by many other gospel and spiritual singing groups in the early part of the 20th century, in addition to being a popular hymn in African-American churches. But it gradually became part of popular music as well. At the dawn of the 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained momentum in the US, there was a revival of interest in traditional folk music and in African-American culture. That made ‘Wade in the Water’ part of the soundtrack to that turbulent decade – both as a vocal number and as an instrumental. "", ""https://www.ft.com/content/da800734-8f97-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78\n'Wade in the Water' entered the soul-jazz repertory in the late 1950s. When musicians took to quoting the first bars of the melody while soloing on other tunes, they were alluding to the song’s coded past life, using it as a signifier to the hip and racially conscious. The first modern jazz recording was a swaggering arrangement by Johnny Griffin’s Big Soul Band in 1960. By 1965, Graham Bond had hold of the song: the album version was short, but live it could take 10 minutes before Jack Bruce on bass and drummer Ginger Baker slammed in with gritty R&B and a template for heavy rock trio Cream. ArtsThe Life of a Song: Wade in the Water A year later the opening brass fanfare, driving tambourine, soul-stirring handclap and joyful piano of the Ramsey Lewis Trio’s million-selling version became a longstanding club classic and a northern soul staple. "", ""https://www.lyricslayers.com/spirituals/wade-in-the-water/\nThe song 'Wade In The Water' is a traditional African American spiritual with deep historical roots. The lyrics convey a message of deliverance and redemption, using the metaphor of water as a medium for change and divine intervention. The repeated line 'God's gonna trouble the water' suggests that God will stir the waters of life, creating a path to freedom or a transformational challenge that must be faced. The reference to the children dressed in red 'must be the ones that Moses led' alludes to the biblical story of the Exodus, where Moses leads the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, which is a powerful symbol of liberation and hope for the African American slaves who originally sang this song.The spiritual is also believed to have had a practical application during the era of the Underground Railroad, where coded messages within the song provided guidance to escaping slaves. The instruction to 'wade in the water' could have been a directive to avoid being tracked by scent dogs. The mention of walking down the highway with 'nowhere to go' reflects the uncertainty and peril faced by those seeking freedom, yet the song remains resolute in its encouragement to keep moving forward, trusting in divine providence.The enduring legacy of 'Wade In The Water' lies in its ability to inspire and uplift. It has been interpreted and recorded by numerous artists over the years, each bringing their own perspective to this powerful anthem. The song's themes of struggle, faith, and the quest for freedom resonate just as strongly today as they did in the past, making it a timeless piece of musical heritage. "", ""https://www.umcdiscipleship.org/resources/history-of-hymns-wade-in-the-water\nWith that background, let us explore the use of Scripture in this spiritual and some theological themes these passages might represent. The refrain of 'Wade in the Water' is based upon the narrative of John 5:2-9. It is the story of the pool by the Sheep Gate—Bethzatha in Hebrew. A portion of this passage follows: 'Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had '(John 5:2-4, KJV) Perhaps, among other possibilities, this is a reference of healing in body and soul.

If you’re wondering what the song is about—the particular story it tells—I can’t help you.

You might be thinking that love in the dark doesn’t sound so bad.

Thomas Niedermueller/Getty Images There is no shortage of stories about the inception of rock anthem 'Total Eclipse of the Heart,' and Meat Loaf’s reported aggravation that the song penned by Jim Steinman was given to Bonnie Tyler instead of him. Now, Tyler has shared more details about the recording of the song and making of the music video. In an interview with The Guardian, Tyler reveals the origins of the power ballad. '[Jim] told me he had started writing the song for a prospective musical version of Nosferatu years before, but never finished it,' she tells the outlet. 'We shot the video in a frightening gothic former asylum in Surrey. The guard dogs wouldn’t set foot in the rooms downstairs where they used to give people electric shock treatment.' The singer adds that she loved working with Steinman and was devastated when he died in 2021. She recalled their collaboration on 'Eclipse.' 'Recently a friend unearthed a letter I’d written to her from New York back then. It says: ‘I recorded an incredible song today. The trouble is, it’s so long, I don’t think anybody will ever play it,’' said Tyler. '’Total Eclipse of the Heart’ had to be shortened from seven to four minutes, but everybody loved it so much they played the full album version anyway.'

With war conditions prevailing, it was apparent to those responsible that the rent reserved under the lease could not be paid out of the profits of the flats and, accordingly, discussions took place between the directors of the two companies concerned, which were closely associated, and an arrangement was made between them which was put into writing. On January 3, 1940, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants in these terms, 'we confirm the arrangement made between us by which the ground rent should be reduced as from the commencement of the lease to 1,250l. per annum,' and on April 2, 1940, a confirmatory resolution to the same effect was passed by the plaintiff company. On March 20, 1941, a receiver was appointed by the debenture holders of the plaintiffs and on his death on February 28, 1944, his place...

33,19,"[""Dragon Ball Z Kai, known in Japan as Dragon Ball Kai (ドラゴンボール改, Doragon Bōru Kai, lit. Dragon Ball Revised), is an anime series that is a high-definition remastered and recut of Dragon Ball Z, done for its 20th Anniversary. It premiered on Fuji TV on April 5, 2009, at 9:00 am just before One Piece and ended initially on March 27, 2011, with 97 episodes (a 98th episode was later released straight-to-video), and the two shows were marketed together as 'Dream 9', which refers to the hour in which they both aired. The series average rating was 9.4%, with its maximum being 12.3% (Episode 47) and its minimum being 6.4% (Episode 18). Dragon Ball Kai returned to Japanese TV on April 6, 2014, with the Majin Buu Saga, and ended its run for the second and last time on June 28, 2015, with 61 episodes while the original uncut international version would go on to have 69 episodes (bringing the total episode count of the series to 159 for the original Japanese broadcast and 167 for the extended International broadcast).[1] "", 'For the Androids Saga, the animation in the opening scene and closing credits have been altered a bit to fit the current storyline. New animations of Dr. Gero, Android 19, Android 17, Android 18, Android 16, and Cell appear, as well as the Super Saiyan appearances of Goku, Vegeta, Future Trunks, and Gohan. The new intro also showcases battles taking place within the saga, such as Vegeta vs. #18, Piccolo vs. #17, #16 vs. Cell, Goku vs. Cell, and ends showing a sequence of the Dragon Team standing together with their Cell Saga appearances. The ending credits are also different, showcasing Goku flying with Shenron as the faces of the main cast appear. He proceeds to transform into a Super Saiyan and the cast joins him in flight. The sequence ends with the Z Fighters standing in front of the Earth, with Shenron and Porunga in the backdrop. ', ""Happinet (the Japanese company releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray) announced the Japanese DVD and Blu-ray release would have an end point of '98 Episodes (tentative)' meaning the planned and announced episode count would end at 99.[12] Actually, Dragon Ball Kai was supposed to last for 98 episodes, but everything had originally been thrown off an entire week due to the horrific tsunami that struck Japan the prior week. The series temporarily ended with 97 episodes aired, and the 98th episode was released direct-to-video. A few years later, the series returned with 61 Majin Buu Saga episodes in Japan.[1] English adaptations Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' logo The title screen translations are far more similar this time around, but are changed to fit properly into English. Edits were made to the version appearing on Nicktoons, including the removal of blood (which was sometimes replaced with black grayish liquid where the blood is supposed to be), overly violent moments, profanity and others. The CW's Toonzai airings, however, were edited even more so than the Nicktoons version, due to tighter restrictions on broadcast programming. These edits include recoloring Mr. Popo's skin from black to blue, replacing dead characters' halos with glowing orbs, removing virtually all references to death in both dialogue and episode titles, and renaming certain special techniques (i.e. Goku's Spirit Bomb renamed as the 'Spirit Blast' and Vegeta's Galick Gun as the 'Galick Blast'). Also in the beginning of the intro song, Toonzai edited out Shenron and replaced him with a green colored sky. When Toonzai became Vortexx, these edits remained but the halos/glowing orbs were removed altogether. On Nicktoons, the series aired from May 24, 2010 to February 8, 2013; on Toonzai/Vortexx, the series aired from August 14, 2010 to September 27, 2014 when the block was cancelled. Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' promotional image The series returned with the 69 Majin Buu Saga episodes in 2014 in Europe, carrying the sub-title 'The Final Chapters'. This remastered and reedited series was broadcasted in the UK on Kix, in Portugal on Sic Radical, in Poland on AXN Spin, and in France on Game One. On May 25, 2014, Funimation and Adult Swim announced that the English dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai would air uncut on Adult Swim's Toonami block starting in fall 2014.[6] The show began airing at 12:00 AM on November 8, 2014, replacing Bleach. Starting on February 21, 2015, a rerun of the previous weeks episode began airing at 8:00 PM on Saturdays outside of the Toonami block, with a new episode at its 12:00 AM time slot as part of Toonami. "", ""Dragon Ball Z uses four pieces of theme music in the Japanese version. From episodes 1–199, the opening theme is 'Cha-La Head-Cha-La' by Hironobu Kageyama, and the closing theme is 'Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Pawā!' by MANNA. From episodes 200–291, the opening and closing themes are 'We Gotta Power' and 'Boku-Tachi wa Tenshi Datta,' both by Hironobu Kageyama. Series overview In Japan, Dragon Ball Z was aired year-round continuously, with regular off-days for sporting events and television specials taking place about once every six weeks on average. The English broadcast was divided into eight separate near-continuous blocks with breaks varying between four months to over a year between each block. Only in one instance, between episodes 194 and 195, was there actually parity between the DVD release and the actual broadcast sequence in terms of the end of one 'season' and the beginning of the next. "", ""Vegeta acknowledging his rival as he fought Kid Buu was a defining moment for Vegeta's character growth. The final Spirit Bomb that Goku launches on Kid Buu is also pretty great to witness in its own right. 3 Everyone Vs Frieza Episodes: 77-86 The Z Warriors put everything on the line to survive Frieza's relentless assault For what it’s worth, the fight against Frieza starts off well-paced enough in the anime. The first 8 episodes are dedicated to everything before Goku shows up, which actually does have a fair bit of material to adapt – perhaps not 8 episodes’ worth, but it’s not an unreasonable number when taking into account how much of an endurance match the battle with Frieza is. Problems start to arise when you look at the arc in perspective, however. Along with these initial 8 episodes, the final fight against Frieza lasts nearly 30 episodes in Dragon Ball Z. That’s over half a year of syndication for a single battle. In the grand scheme of things, it’s simply too much. "", 'The original Dragon Ball finds the perfect length that’s neither too cumbersome nor brief, which is appropriate as Toriyama tests the waters and sees what audiences think of this heightened world. Dragon Ball, as a manga, ran for 194 chapters, which has been compiled into 16 volumes. It’s a respectable length for a starter shonen series. Alternatively, Dragon Ball’s anime adaptation is 153 episodes and it doesn’t stray very far from its source material. There are a handful of filler episodes, but the Dragon Ball anime is quite faithful to its manga and doesn’t indulge in any wild detours. There was originally no official delineation between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z in Toriyama’s manga. Chapter 196 just kicked off with a five-year time-jump that ushers in Goku’s adult adventures, now with a family and young child. Dragon Ball saw plenty of success, but Dragon Ball Z catapulted this fame to new heights with a greater emphasis on action, ki-based combat, and powerful transformations. Dragon Ball Z is significantly longer than its predecessor and it makes up the majority of the Dragon Ball franchise. The manga ran for 325 chapters across 26 volumes, which brings it and the original Dragon Ball to a combined 519 chapters of material. Dragon Ball Z’s anime is also not one for brevity and it nearly doubles the original series’ episode count at 291. Dragon Ball Z doesn’t remove any of its manga’s storylines, but it does get more indulgent with filler material, particularly when it comes to extending fights. ', ""Dragon Ball Super changed fans' standard of quality. It also made them reconsider Dragon Ball GT and wonder whether it was a good show. Dragon Ball Super is the latest canonical Dragon Ball entry and it continues to turn out new content and contribute to the greater Dragon Ball lore. Dragon Ball Super was developed as an alternate sequel series to Dragon Ball Z that disregards Dragon Ball GT. However, Dragon Ball Super is curiously set right after Kid Buu’s defeat. This means that the entire series takes place before Dragon Ball Z’s Peaceful World Saga ending, which turns the clock forward ten years for its epilogue, which is set at the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament. Dragon Ball Super has crammed a tremendous amount into this ten-year window, even if some of it pushes the limits of incredulity. Dragon Ball Super produced 131 episodes before its relatively abrupt finale during the Tournament of Power’s conclusion.

These rights are known as 'fundamental' as they are the most essential for all-round development i.e., material, intellectual, moral and spiritual and protected by fundamental law of the land i.e. constitution. If the rights provided by Constitution especially the Fundamental rights are violated the Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue writs under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, respectively, directing the State Machinery for enforcement of the fundamental rights. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms where every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality and life. These rights apply universally to all citizens of India, irrespective of their race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to certain restrictions. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. Fundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and hence prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour. They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions.

Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may be imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences and defamation. The State is also empowered, in the interests of the general public to nationalize any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens. The freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are further sought to be protected by Articles 20–22. The scope of these articles, particularly with respect to the doctrine of due process, was heavily debated by the Constituent Assembly. It was argued, especially by Benegal Narsing Rau, that the incorporation of such a clause would hamper social legislation and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order, and therefore it ought to be excluded from the Constitution altogether. The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase 'due process' in favor of 'procedure established by law'. As a result, Article 21, which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by law, was, until 1978, construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action. However, in 1978, the Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action, holding that any law laying down a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable, and effectively reading due process into Article 21. In the same case, the Supreme Court also ruled that 'life' under Article 21 meant more than a mere 'animal existence'; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life 'meaningful, complete and worth living'. Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood, good health, clean environment, water, speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned.

The song, which has been described by members of Three Dog Night as a 'kid's song' and a 'silly song', topped the singles charts in North America, was certified gold by the RIAA, and has since been covered by multiple artists. Background and recording Some of the words are nonsensical. Axton wanted to persuade his record producers to record a new melody he had written, and the producers asked him to sing any words to the tune.

I’ve always liked Three Dog Night but entirely as a band I hear on the radio. Prior to doing this post, I couldn’t name one single album of theirs nor was I 100% certain I could name six tunes I dug. But I could and did. I will overlook 'Joy to the World' which is probably fun to sing at a wedding reception especially if you’re totally fucked-up. First, as always, a little history. I’m relying on Wikipedia and whatever else I can find because their website bio is less history and more 'ain’t we swell’ puff piece. Three Dog Night is an American rock band formed in 1967, with founding members consisting of vocalists Danny Hutton, Cory Wells, and Chuck Negron. This lineup was soon augmented by Jimmy Greenspoon (keyboards), Joe Schermie (bass), Michael Allsup (guitar), and Floyd Sneed (drums). "", ""The only song that appears in both The Big Chill (1983) and Forrest Gump (1994) is Three Dog Night’s exuberant 'Joy to the World,' whose delirious mash-up of Biblical allusions, anti-war rhetoric and free-love bawdiness made it a kind of consensus hit in culturally polarized times: in terms of sales and airplay, it was the biggest song of 1971. Where Three Dog Night was a pure El Lay band, 'Joy to the World' was written by an Oklahoman, Hoyt Axton, whose mother Mae actually co-wrote 'Heartbreak Hotel' for Elvis Presley—a coincidence that recalls the (obviously speculative) scene in Forrest Gump where the King is shown honing his craft in an Alabama boarding-house room. 'Joy to the World'’s appearance in Gump is relatively unimportant: it plays behind scenes of the hero practicing ping-pong diplomacy in front of an enormous mural of Chairman Mao—a bit of classic-rock patriotism. But its use as an overture in The Big Chill—sung hoarsely at bath time by a young child right before his Dad gets some bad news via telephone—is suggestive: the sound of a cozy, insular bubble bursting.

The three first came together in 1967 to create some recordings with Brian Wilson.  In those days they went under the name of Redwood. In 1968, the vocalists looked around for some musicians of their own and Three Dog Night was formed. The name Three Dog Night was suggested by the girlfriend of vocalist Danny Hutton.  She had read a magazine article about indigenous Australians.  It explained that on cold nights they would sleep in a hole in the ground while embracing a dingo (a native species of wild dog). On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs and if the night were freezing, it was a 'three dog night.' Between 1969 and 1975, Three Dog Night scored 21 Billboard Top 40 hits, including three #1’s.

His words help us see our sin and help us confess that sin. Then, when we have done so, we should help him drink his wine singing joy to the world rather than wallow in self-pity. For there’s joy in the release from sin that Jesus provides. Not release just from guilt and wallowing in self-pity. Release from the fact that sin can define us at all. Sin is not how God sees us. God sees us as a reflection of himself, images of God. God sees us as beloved children, brothers and sisters of his own Son Jesus Christ. God sees us and says, in the words of Psalm 139, that we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made.' Jesus provides for that. One of the big things that happened on the cross was this: sin no longer defines who we are in God’s eyes. God looks at us and says, just as he did to the woman at the well, 'Go, and sin no more…I forgive your iniquity and remember your sins no more.'

I’m relying on Wikipedia and whatever else I can find because their website bio is less history and more 'ain’t we swell’ puff piece. Three Dog Night is an American rock band formed in 1967, with founding members consisting of vocalists Danny Hutton, Cory Wells, and Chuck Negron. This lineup was soon augmented by Jimmy Greenspoon (keyboards), Joe Schermie (bass), Michael Allsup (guitar), and Floyd Sneed (drums). "", ""https://oxfordamerican.org/web-only/the-big-chill-forrest-gump-soundtrack\nThe only song that appears in both The Big Chill (1983) and Forrest Gump (1994) is Three Dog Night’s exuberant 'Joy to the World,' whose delirious mash-up of \x1b[95m[7] Biblical allusions, anti-war rhetoric and free-love bawdiness\x1b[0m made it a kind of consensus hit in culturally polarized times: in terms of sales and airplay, it was the biggest song of 1971. Where Three Dog Night was a pure El Lay band, 'Joy to the World' was written by an Oklahoman, Hoyt Axton, whose mother Mae actually co-wrote 'Heartbreak Hotel' for Elvis Presley—a coincidence that recalls the (obviously speculative) scene in Forrest Gump where the King is shown honing his craft in an Alabama boarding-house room. 'Joy to the World'’s appearance in Gump is relatively unimportant: it plays behind scenes of the hero practicing ping-pong diplomacy in front of an enormous mural of Chairman Mao—a bit of classic-rock patriotism. But its use as an overture in The Big Chill—sung hoarsely at bath time by a young child right before his Dad gets some bad news via telephone—is suggestive: the sound of a cozy, insular bubble bursting.

In 1968, the vocalists looked around for some musicians of their own and Three Dog Night was formed. The name Three Dog Night was suggested by the girlfriend of vocalist Danny Hutton.  She had read a magazine article about indigenous Australians.  It explained that on cold nights they would sleep in a hole in the ground while embracing a dingo (a native species of wild dog).

"", ""https://tedgoshorn.org/2022/10/30/jeremiah-was-a-bullfrog-or-a-prophet/\nThree Dog Night got it right. We should befriend Jeremiah. His words help us see our sin and help us confess that sin. Then, when we have done so, we should help him drink his wine singing joy to the world rather than wallow in self-pity. For there’s joy in the release from sin that Jesus provides. Not release just from guilt and wallowing in self-pity. Release from the fact that sin can define us at all. Sin is not how God sees us. God sees us as a reflection of himself, images of God. God sees us as beloved children, brothers and sisters of his own Son Jesus Christ. God sees us and says, in the words of Psalm 139, that we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made.' Jesus provides for that. One of the big things that happened on the cross was this: sin no longer defines who we are in God’s eyes. God looks at us and says, just as he did to the woman at the well, 'Go, and sin no more…I forgive your iniquity and remember your sins no more.'

Decision ', ""https://vlex.co.uk/vid/central-london-property-trust-802942509\nBy a lease under seal made on September 24, 1937, the plaintiffs, Central London Property Trust Ld., granted to the defendants, High Trees House Ld., a subsidiary of the plaintiff company, a tenancy of a block of flats for the term of ninety-nine years from September 29, 1937, at a ground rent of 2,500l. a year. The block of flats was a new one and had not been fully occupied at the beginning of the war owing to the absence of people from London. With war conditions prevailing, it was apparent to those responsible that the rent reserved under the lease could not be paid out of the profits of the flats and, accordingly, discussions took place between the directors of the two companies concerned, which were closely associated, and an arrangement was made between them which was put into writing. On January 3, 1940, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants in these terms, 'we confirm the arrangement made between us by which the ground rent should be reduced as from the commencement of the lease to 1,250l. per annum,' and on April 2, 1940, a confirmatory resolution to the same effect was passed by the plaintiff company.

38,30,"[""λίθος (líthos) 'stone') is a chemical element; it has symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. "", ""Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is silvery-white. In air it oxidizes to lithium oxide. Its melting point of 180.50 °C (453.65 K; 356.90 °F) and its boiling point of 1,342 °C (1,615 K; 2,448 °F) are each the highest of all the alkali metals while its density of 0.534 g/cm3 is the lowest. Lithium has a very low density (0.534 g/cm3), comparable with pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is more than 60% denser. Apart from helium and hydrogen, as a solid it is less dense than any other element as a liquid, being only two-thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium. Lithium floating in oil Lithium's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures. Lithium has a mass specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin, the highest of all solids. Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications. Isotopes Main article: Isotopes of lithium Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (95.15% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than hydrogen-1, deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms.

Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium\nLithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is silvery-white. In air it oxidizes to lithium oxide. Its melting point of 180.50 °C (453.65 K; 356.90 °F) and its boiling point of 1,342 °C (1,615 K; 2,448 °F) are each the highest of all the alkali metals while its density of 0.534 g/cm3 is the lowest. Lithium has a very low density (0.534 g/cm3), comparable with pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is more than 60% denser. Apart from helium and hydrogen, as a solid it is less dense than any other element as a liquid, being only two-thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium. Lithium floating in oil Lithium's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures. Lithium has a mass specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin, the highest of all solids. Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications. Isotopes Main article: Isotopes of lithium Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (95.15% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than hydrogen-1, deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s. The 6Li isotope is one of only five stable nuclides to have both an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons, the other four stable odd-odd nuclides being hydrogen-2, boron-10, nitrogen-14, and tantalum-180m.

They compete in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system. They play their home matches at the Select Car Leasing Stadium. Reading are nicknamed The Royals, due to Reading's location in the Royal County of Berkshire, though they were previously known as The Biscuitmen, due to the town's association with biscuit maker Huntley & Palmers. Established in 1871, the club is one of the oldest teams in England, but did not join The Football League until 1920, and first played in the top tier of English football league system in the 2006–07 season. The club competed in the 2012–13 Premier League season, having gained promotion at the end of the 2011–12 season after winning the Championship, but were relegated after just one season back in the top flight. Reading won the 1987–88 Full Members' Cup and were one of only two Second Division clubs to lift the trophy, beating Luton Town 4–1 in the final at Wembley. The club's best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the semi-finals which they achieved twice: in 1926–27 and 2014–15. The club played at Elm Park for 102 years, from 1896 to 1998. In 1998, the club moved to the new Madejski Stadium, which was named after the club's former chairman Sir John Madejski. In 2021, the club announced that the ground would be known as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the subsequent decade for sponsorship reasons. "", ""Reading started the 2008–09 season with a 15 match unbeaten home run. They finished fourth and qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Burnley in the semi-final. Manager Steve Coppell resigned just hours after the game, replaced by Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009 and Brian McDermott made caretaker manager the same day. In the 2010–11 FA Cup, Reading reached the quarter-final, where they lost 1–0 to Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, Reading eventually finished fifth in the Championship to qualify for the division's play-offs. After beating Cardiff City in the semi-finals, they lost 4–2 to Swansea City in the final at Wembley. In the 2011–12 season, a streak of good form in the second half of the season, ensured promotion back to the Premier League on 17 April 2012 with 1–0 home win against Nottingham Forest. "", ""In the summer leading up to the 2016–17 season the club announced the departure of Brian McDermott and eventually he was to be replaced by former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam. Under Stam, Reading achieved their highest finish since relegation back to the Championship by finishing third and reaching the play-offs, where they beat Fulham on aggregate before facing Huddersfield Town in the final at Wembley where they lost on penalties following 0–0 draw after extra time. In 2017, Chinese investors Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li acquired the club. The team languished towards the bottom of the table for most of the 2017–18 season. On 21 March 2018, Stam resigned as manager after a nine-game winless run. Two days later, on 23 March 2018, Paul Clement was appointed as Reading's new manager; the club finished the season in 20th place, avoiding relegation by three points. "", ""On 17 November 2021 it was confirmed Reading would be deducted six points due to breaching the EFL's profitability and sustainability rules. Over five years, the club reported pre-tax losses of £146m, way beyond the EFL's limit of a £13m annual pre-tax loss. In 2021, the club spent 234% of its revenue on player wages. Following a 3–2 away victory over Preston North End in February 2022, manager Veljko Paunović left by mutual consent, with Paul Ince being placed in interim charge of the team alongside academy manager Michael Gilkes. On 16 May, Ince became the team's permanent manager, with Mark Bowen returning as head of football operations. "", ""In June 2023, Reading were charged by the EFL with failing to pay their players on time and in full, in October and November 2022, and April 2023, and with non-payment of taxes - charges that meant Reading might start their 2023–24 League One season with a points deduction. Following the EFL's action, Reading fans groups united to launch a campaign, Sell Before We Dai, urging owner Dai Yongge to sell the club, calling his stewardship 'an unmitigated disaster' and citing the club's 'excruciating financial losses'. On 27 June, Reading were served a winding-up petition by HMRC over the unpaid tax bills, with a hearing set for 9 August (on 12 July, football finance expert Kieran Maguire described the club's ownership as 'a car crash'). On 28 July, the club was placed under another transfer embargo because of the unpaid taxes. On 2 August, Dai Yongge was reported to be seeking new investors to bring financial stability to the club. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2023, Reading announced the provisional appointment of Rubén Sellés as their new manager, confirmed on 14 July, after his visa application was successful. On 16 August 2023, after one win and two defeats in their opening three league fixtures, Reading had a point deducted (their third deduction in three consecutive seasons), and a further three-point deduction suspended, for its failures to pay players fully and on time during the 2022–23 season. Dai Yongge was ordered to pay 125% of the club's forecast monthly wages into a designated account. Failure to comply, or not paying wages on time up to 30 June 2024, would activate the suspended penalty; the three-point deduction was applied on 13 September, and Dai Yongge faced a misconduct charge. On 29 September 2023, Dai Yongge said he was open to 'credible offers of interest' to buy the club after another transfer embargo was imposed in respect to an outstanding tax bill. A 3–2 home defeat by Portsmouth on 28 October dropped the club to the bottom of League One on six points, eight from safety; the match was preceded by a fans protest against Dai Yongge's ownership. On 31 October, the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. On 1 November, Reading were referred to an EFL independent disciplinary commission regarding unpaid HMRC debts owed in September and October 2023. On 9 November, a sale of the club was reported to be progressing, and the latest winding-up petition and transfer embargo had been resolved. On 19 December 2023, Dai Yongge was fined £20,000 for Reading's wages failures; the EFL had recommended a 12-month ban from all football activities, but an independent disciplinary commission opted not to enforce it. A further £50,000 fine was suspended until 12 January 2024, and was triggered after Dai Yongge again failed to make the required full wage deposits. On 27 February 2024, Reading received their second points deduction of the season, being docked two more points by the EFL after failing to make HMRC payments within an 80-day limit. The deduction left the club three points above the relegation places. In total, under Dai Yongge's ownership, the club has had 18 points deducted. In March 2024, Dai Yongge was 'open to the sale' of the club's Bearwood Park training facility to secure funding while new owners were sought, a move criticised by supporters groups for the confusing message it sent to potential investors; the club faces a cash shortfall of about £1m for March. On 14 March, Reading announced they were holding talks with Wycombe Wanderers over the sale of Bearwood Park, but Wycombe put the talks 'on hold' after learning that 'planning limitations allowed only Reading to use the grounds'.

Following the EFL's action, Reading fans groups united to launch a campaign, Sell Before We Dai, urging owner Dai Yongge to sell the club, calling his stewardship 'an unmitigated disaster' and citing the club's 'excruciating financial losses'. On 27 June, Reading were served a winding-up petition by HMRC over the unpaid tax bills, with a hearing set for 9 August (on 12 July, football finance expert Kieran Maguire described the club's ownership as 'a car crash'). On 28 July, the club was placed under another transfer embargo because of the unpaid taxes. On 2 August, Dai Yongge was reported to be seeking new investors to bring financial stability to the club. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2023, Reading announced the provisional appointment of Rubén Sellés as their new manager, confirmed on 14 July, after his visa application was successful. On 16 August 2023, after one win and two defeats in their opening three league fixtures, Reading had a point deducted (their third deduction in three consecutive seasons), and a further three-point deduction suspended, for its failures to pay players fully and on time during the 2022–23 season. Dai Yongge was ordered to pay 125% of the club's forecast monthly wages into a designated account. Failure to comply, or not paying wages on time up to 30 June 2024, would activate the suspended penalty; the three-point deduction was applied on 13 September, and Dai Yongge faced a misconduct charge. On 29 September 2023, Dai Yongge said he was open to 'credible offers of interest' to buy the club after another transfer embargo was imposed in respect to an outstanding tax bill. A 3–2 home defeat by Portsmouth on 28 October dropped the club to the bottom of League One on six points, eight from safety; the match was preceded by a fans protest against Dai Yongge's ownership. On 31 October, the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. On 1 November, Reading were referred to an EFL independent disciplinary commission regarding unpaid HMRC debts owed in September and October 2023. On 9 November, a sale of the club was reported to be progressing, and the latest winding-up petition and transfer embargo had been resolved. On 19 December 2023, Dai Yongge was fined £20,000 for Reading's wages failures; the EFL had recommended a 12-month ban from all football activities, but an independent disciplinary commission opted not to enforce it. A further £50,000 fine was suspended until 12 January 2024, and was triggered after Dai Yongge again failed to make the required full wage deposits. On 27 February 2024, Reading received their second points deduction of the season, being docked two more points by the EFL after failing to make HMRC payments within an 80-day limit. The deduction left the club three points above the relegation places. In total, under Dai Yongge's ownership, the club has had 18 points deducted. In March 2024, Dai Yongge was 'open to the sale' of the club's Bearwood Park training facility to secure funding while new owners were sought, a move criticised by supporters groups for the confusing message it sent to potential investors; the club faces a cash shortfall of about £1m for March. On 14 March, Reading announced they were holding talks with Wycombe Wanderers over the sale of Bearwood Park, but Wycombe put the talks 'on hold' after learning that 'planning limitations allowed only Reading to use the grounds'.

"", ""‘Wade in the Water’ originated in the southern US in the mid-1800s, as a spiritual sung by enslaved African-Americans. In those communities, spirituals were more than just expressions of religious devotion. Some spirituals would be sung to alert freedom-seekers when it was safest to escape, without slaveholders ('masters') knowing that information was being communicated.  The lyrics of ‘Wade in the Water’ reference the Biblical story of the Israelites crossing the river Jordan, but the lyrics also remind those seeking freedom to walk in the rivers along their journey, so that tracking dogs and slave-catchers could not follow their footprints or their scent. ‘Wade in the Water’ became one of the best-known spirituals in the African-American community, but it wasn’t more broadly known until it was performed by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. This a capella group was formed at Fisk University in Nashville, established in 1867 to educate freed men and women. In 1871, the Singers were sent on a US tour to raise money for the financially struggling university. That November, they appeared at a national convention of ministers, where, according to their website, '[a]fter a few standard ballads the chorus sang spirituals and other songs associated with slavery. It was one of the first public performances of the secret music African-Americans sang in the fields and behind closed doors for generations.' Further tours by the Singers, including trips to Europe and Australia, and the publication of the song’s music and lyrics in the early 1900s took ‘Wade in the Water’ to even larger national and international audiences. The song was first recorded in ‘25 by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers, and was performed and recorded by many other gospel and spiritual singing groups in the early part of the 20th century, in addition to being a popular hymn in African-American churches. But it gradually became part of popular music as well. At the dawn of the 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained momentum in the US, there was a revival of interest in traditional folk music and in African-American culture. That made ‘Wade in the Water’ part of the soundtrack to that turbulent decade – both as a vocal number and as an instrumental. "", ""'Wade in the Water' entered the soul-jazz repertory in the late 1950s. When musicians took to quoting the first bars of the melody while soloing on other tunes, they were alluding to the song’s coded past life, using it as a signifier to the hip and racially conscious. The first modern jazz recording was a swaggering arrangement by Johnny Griffin’s Big Soul Band in 1960. By 1965, Graham Bond had hold of the song: the album version was short, but live it could take 10 minutes before Jack Bruce on bass and drummer Ginger Baker slammed in with gritty R&B and a template for heavy rock trio Cream. ArtsThe Life of a Song: Wade in the Water A year later the opening brass fanfare, driving tambourine, soul-stirring handclap and joyful piano of the Ramsey Lewis Trio’s million-selling version became a longstanding club classic and a northern soul staple. "", ""The song 'Wade In The Water' is a traditional African American spiritual with deep historical roots. The lyrics convey a message of deliverance and redemption, using the metaphor of water as a medium for change and divine intervention. The repeated line 'God's gonna trouble the water' suggests that God will stir the waters of life, creating a path to freedom or a transformational challenge that must be faced. The reference to the children dressed in red 'must be the ones that Moses led' alludes to the biblical story of the Exodus, where Moses leads the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, which is a powerful symbol of liberation and hope for the African American slaves who originally sang this song.The spiritual is also believed to have had a practical application during the era of the Underground Railroad, where coded messages within the song provided guidance to escaping slaves. The instruction to 'wade in the water' could have been a directive to avoid being tracked by scent dogs. The mention of walking down the highway with 'nowhere to go' reflects the uncertainty and peril faced by those seeking freedom, yet the song remains resolute in its encouragement to keep moving forward, trusting in divine providence.The enduring legacy of 'Wade In The Water' lies in its ability to inspire and uplift. It has been interpreted and recorded by numerous artists over the years, each bringing their own perspective to this powerful anthem. The song's themes of struggle, faith, and the quest for freedom resonate just as strongly today as they did in the past, making it a timeless piece of musical heritage. "", ""With that background, let us explore the use of Scripture in this spiritual and some theological themes these passages might represent. The refrain of 'Wade in the Water' is based upon the narrative of John 5:2-9. It is the story of the pool by the Sheep Gate—Bethzatha in Hebrew. A portion of this passage follows: 'Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had '(John 5:2-4, KJV) Perhaps, among other possibilities, this is a reference of healing in body and soul.

"", ""https://writingonmusic.com/2021/08/06/deep-waters-wade-in-the-water/\n‘Wade in the Water’ originated in the southern US in the mid-1800s, as a spiritual sung by enslaved African-Americans. In those communities, spirituals were more than just expressions of religious devotion. Some spirituals would be sung to alert freedom-seekers when it was safest to escape, without slaveholders ('masters') knowing that information was being communicated.  The lyrics of \x1b[102m ‘Wade in the Water’ reference the Biblical story of the Israelites crossing the river Jordan\x1b[0m, but \x1b[102m the lyrics also remind those seeking freedom to walk in the rivers along their journey, so that tracking dogs and slave-catchers could not follow their footprints or their scent\x1b[0m. ‘Wade in the Water’ became one of the best-known spirituals in the African-American community, but it wasn’t more broadly known until it was performed by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. This a capella group was formed at Fisk University in Nashville, established in 1867 to educate freed men and women. In 1871, the Singers were sent on a US tour to raise money for the financially struggling university. That November, they appeared at a national convention of ministers, where, according to their website, '[a]fter a few standard ballads the chorus sang spirituals and other songs associated with slavery. It was one of the first public performances of the secret music African-Americans sang in the fields and behind closed doors for generations.' Further tours by the Singers, including trips to Europe and Australia, and the publication of the song’s music and lyrics in the early 1900s took ‘Wade in the Water’ to even larger national and international audiences. The song was first recorded in ‘25 by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers, and was performed and recorded by many other gospel and spiritual singing groups in the early part of the 20th century, in addition to being a popular hymn in African-American churches. But it gradually became part of popular music as well. At the dawn of the 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained momentum in the US, there was a revival of interest in traditional folk music and in African-American culture. That made ‘Wade in the Water’ part of the soundtrack to that turbulent decade – both as a vocal number and as an instrumental. ""]","[""Songs used Biblical references and analogies of Biblical people, places and stories, comparing them to their own history of slavery. For example, 'being bound for the land of Canaan' for a white person could mean ready to die and go to heaven; but to a slave it meant ready to go to Canada. These are the lyrics of some songs that have been passed along for generations. \x1b[92m In Wade in the Water Tubman used 'Wade in the Water' to tell slaves to get into the water to avoid being seen and make it through\x1b[0m. \x1b[92m This is an example of a map song, where directions are coded into the lyrics\x1b[0m. These are the lyrics to 'Wade in the Water' Chorus: Wade in the Water, wade in the water children. Wade in the Water. God’s gonna trouble the water. Who are those children all dressed in Red? God’s gonna trouble the water. Must be the ones that Moses led. God’s gonna trouble the water. Chorus Who are those children all dressed in White? God’s gonna trouble the water.

The song is a parody of the song of the same name from Slim Thug's debut album Already Platinum. The song is narrated by a businessman (Andy Samberg) who describes his increasingly outlandish daily activities as 'the boss'. The music video initially aired as an SNL Digital Short on Saturday Night Live with actor Seth Rogen. In 2011, it was subject to a lawsuit from the producers of the song, who claimed they never received proper compensation for their work. Song 'Like a Boss' premiered as a Saturday Night Live Digital Short on April 4, 2009. In the song, Andy Samberg is a businessman, evidently in middle management, having a performance review. The reviewer asks him to describe the things he does in an average day, and does so for the remainder of the song in his trademark aggressive style, with the activities described initially being mundane management tasks but becoming increasingly bizarre throughout the course of the song. The lyrics 'like a boss' are repeated after every activity. This song parodies the song of the same name by Slim Thug.

Boss has long meant, and continues to mean, a 'person in charge,' especially used, of course, in professional contexts. Boss has also long been a slang term for 'excellent,' with evidence reaching back to the 1880s. Boss took off, though, as a youth slang term for 'superlative' and the like ('That new song is boss') in the 1960s.

In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and stores it. The bile is then released via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats. The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved – usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder (called a cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease. Structure The gallbladder is a hollow grey-blue organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the liver. In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 inches) in length and 4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter when fully distended. The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres (1.8 imperial fluid ounces). The gallbladder is shaped like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct. The gallbladder is divided into three sections: the fundus, body, and neck. The fundus is the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree. The gallbladder fossa, against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V. The cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct. At the junction of the neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct, there is an out-pouching of the gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as 'Hartmann's pouch'. "", 'The gallbladder develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. Early in development, the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. During the second week of embryogenesis, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract.

43,29,"[""'Joy to the World' is a song written by Hoyt Axton and made famous by the band Three Dog Night. The song is also popularly known by its opening lyric, 'Jeremiah was a bullfrog'.

The song, which has been described by members of Three Dog Night as a 'kid's song' and a 'silly song', topped the singles charts in North America, was certified gold by the RIAA, and has since been covered by multiple artists. Background and recording Some of the words are nonsensical. Axton wanted to persuade his record producers to record a new melody he had written, and the producers asked him to sing any words to the tune.

Where Three Dog Night was a pure El Lay band, 'Joy to the World' was written by an Oklahoman, Hoyt Axton, whose mother Mae actually co-wrote 'Heartbreak Hotel' for Elvis Presley—a coincidence that recalls the (obviously speculative) scene in Forrest Gump where the King is shown honing his craft in an Alabama boarding-house room. 'Joy to the World'’s appearance in Gump is relatively unimportant: it plays behind scenes of the hero practicing ping-pong diplomacy in front of an enormous mural of Chairman Mao—a bit of classic-rock patriotism. But its use as an overture in The Big Chill—sung hoarsely at bath time by a young child right before his Dad gets some bad news via telephone—is suggestive: the sound of a cozy, insular bubble bursting.

The three first came together in 1967 to create some recordings with Brian Wilson.  In those days they went under the name of Redwood. In 1968, the vocalists looked around for some musicians of their own and Three Dog Night was formed. The name Three Dog Night was suggested by the girlfriend of vocalist Danny Hutton.  She had read a magazine article about indigenous Australians.  It explained that on cold nights they would sleep in a hole in the ground while embracing a dingo (a native species of wild dog). On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs and if the night were freezing, it was a 'three dog night.'

His words help us see our sin and help us confess that sin. Then, when we have done so, we should help him drink his wine singing joy to the world rather than wallow in self-pity. For there’s joy in the release from sin that Jesus provides. Not release just from guilt and wallowing in self-pity. Release from the fact that sin can define us at all. Sin is not how God sees us. God sees us as a reflection of himself, images of God. God sees us as beloved children, brothers and sisters of his own Son Jesus Christ. God sees us and says, in the words of Psalm 139, that we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made.' Jesus provides for that. One of the big things that happened on the cross was this: sin no longer defines who we are in God’s eyes. God looks at us and says, just as he did to the woman at the well, 'Go, and sin no more…I forgive your iniquity and remember your sins no more.'

Released in 1971, Joy to the World sold five million copies. three dog night fax Three Dog Night is an American band primarily featuring the talents of three vocalists: Danny Hutton, Cory Wells and Chuck Negron.  The three first came together in 1967 to create some recordings with Brian Wilson.  In those days they went under the name of Redwood. In 1968, the vocalists looked around for some musicians of their own and Three Dog Night was formed. The name Three Dog Night was suggested by the girlfriend of vocalist Danny Hutton.  She had read a magazine article about indigenous Australians.  It explained that on cold nights they would sleep in a hole in the ground while embracing a dingo (a native species of wild dog). On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs and if the night were freezing, it was a 'three dog night.' Between 1969 and 1975, Three Dog Night scored 21 Billboard Top 40 hits, including three #1’s. The band introduced the world to many artists and songwriters by recording the works of people such as: Paul Williams, Hoyt Axton, Laura Nyro, Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, and Leo Sayer.

"", ""https://tedgoshorn.org/2022/10/30/jeremiah-was-a-bullfrog-or-a-prophet/\nThree Dog Night got it right. We should befriend Jeremiah. His words help us see our sin and help us confess that sin. Then, when we have done so, we should help him drink his wine singing joy to the world rather than wallow in self-pity. For there’s joy in the release from sin that Jesus provides. Not release just from guilt and wallowing in self-pity. Release from the fact that sin can define us at all. Sin is not how God sees us. God sees us as a reflection of himself, images of God. God sees us as beloved children, brothers and sisters of his own Son Jesus Christ. God sees us and says, in the words of Psalm 139, that we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made.' Jesus provides for that. One of the big things that happened on the cross was this: sin no longer defines who we are in God’s eyes. God looks at us and says, just as he did to the woman at the well, 'Go, and sin no more…I forgive your iniquity and remember your sins no more.'

45,25,"[""Diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian, and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale. Eyes vary in their visual acuity, the range of wavelengths they can detect, their sensitivity in no light, their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects, and whether they can discriminate colours. History of research The human eye, showing the iris and pupil In 1802, philosopher William Paley called it a miracle of 'design.' In 1859, Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species, that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance 'absurd in the highest possible degree'. However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible: "", ""Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors. Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classic paper that only a few hundred thousand generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates. Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through. All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory. Rate of evolution The first possible fossils of eyes found to date are from the Ediacaran period (about 555 million years ago), while the oldest certain fossilized eye is from a Schmidtiellus reetae fossil from 530 mya, collected in Saviranna in northern Estonia. The structure is similar to the compound eyes of modern-day dragonflies and bees, but with (~100) ommatidia spaced further apart, and without a lens. The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the 'Cambrian explosion'. One of the many hypotheses for 'causes' of the Cambrian explosion is the 'Light Switch' theory of Andrew Parker: it holds that the evolution of advanced eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution. Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision. The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate because the fossil record, particularly of the lower Cambrian, is poor. How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells can evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation, relative advantage to the organism, and natural selection. However, the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year, which is common in small animals. Even with these pessimistic values, the vertebrate eye could still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years.[note 1] Origins of the eye Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye. All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development. This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light-sensitive machinery – even if it was not a dedicated optical organ. However, even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells. Probably, photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion. Higher-level similarities – such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses – reflect the co-option of a more fundamental protein to a new function within the eye. A shared trait common to all light-sensitive organs are opsins. Opsins belong to a family of photo-sensitive proteins and fall into nine groups, which already existed in the urbilaterian, the last common ancestor of all bilaterally symmetrical animals. Additionally, the genetic toolkit for positioning eyes is shared by all animals: The PAX6 gene controls where eyes develop in animals ranging from octopuses to mice and fruit flies. Such high-level genes are, by implication, much older than many of the structures that they control today; they must originally have served a different purpose, before they were co-opted for eye development. Eyes and other sensory organs probably evolved before the brain: There is no need for an information-processing organ (brain) before there is information to process. A living example are cubozoan jellyfish that possess eyes comparable to vertebrate and cephalopod camera eyes despite lacking a brain. Stages of evolution "", ""Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation. Vision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes. However, how this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism's environment varies widely: eyes have a wide range of structures and forms, all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules. At a cellular level, there appear to be two main types of eyes, one possessed by the protostomes (molluscs, annelid worms and arthropods), the other by the deuterostomes (chordates and echinoderms). "", ""The basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules bound to each other and located in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein; and a chromophore, the pigment that absorbs light. Groups of such cells are termed 'eyespots', and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings. Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species. The planarian has 'cup' eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction. These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup, which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions, then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened. While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light, as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo-sensitive cells regardless of its direction, the 'cup' shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light's angle. Pit eyes, which had arisen by the Cambrian period, were seen in ancient snails,[clarification needed] and are found in some snails and other invertebrates living today, such as planaria. Planaria can slightly differentiate the direction and intensity of light because of their cup-shaped, heavily pigmented retina cells, which shield the light-sensitive cells from exposure in all directions except for the single opening for the light. However, this proto-eye is still much more useful for detecting the absence or presence of light than its direction; this gradually changes as the eye's pit deepens and the number of photoreceptive cells grows, allowing for increasingly precise visual information. When a photon is absorbed by the chromophore, a chemical reaction causes the photon's energy to be transduced into electrical energy and relayed, in higher animals, to the nervous system. These photoreceptor cells form part of the retina, a thin layer of cells that relays visual information, including the light and day-length information needed by the circadian rhythm system, to the brain. However, some jellyfish, such as Cladonema (Cladonematidae), have elaborate eyes but no brain. Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain. During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction. The nautilus eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera.

The Air Corps determined that the existing programs would be used for all units, including all-black units. At Tuskegee, this effort continued with the selection and training of the Tuskegee Airmen. The War Department set up a system to accept only those with a level of flight experience or higher education which ensured that only the ablest and most intelligent African-American applicants were able to join.[citation needed] ', ""A group of 271 enlisted men began training in aircraft ground support trades at Chanute Field in March 1941 until they were transferred to bases in Alabama in July 1941. The skills being taught were so technical that setting up segregated classes was deemed impossible. This small number of enlisted men became the core of other black squadrons forming at Tuskegee Fields in Alabama. While the enlisted men were in training, five black youths were admitted to the Officers Training School (OTS) at Chanute Field as aviation cadets. Specifically, Elmer D. Jones, Dudley Stevenson, and James Johnson of Washington, DC; Nelson Brooks of Illinois, and William R. Thompson of Pittsburgh, PA successfully completed OTS and were commissioned as the first Black Army Air Corps Officers. In June 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was transferred to Tuskegee, Alabama, and remained the only black flying unit in the country, but did not yet have pilots. The famous airmen were actually trained at five airfields surrounding Tuskegee University (formerly Tuskegee Institute)--Griel, Kennedy, Moton, Shorter, and Tuskegee Army Air Fields. The flying unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men and was backed by an entire service arm. On 19 July 1941, thirteen individuals made up the first class of aviation cadets (42-C) when they entered preflight training at Tuskegee Institute. After primary training at Moton Field, they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field, about 10 miles (16 km) to the west for conversion training onto operational types. Consequently, Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training (basic, advanced, and transition) at a single location. Initial planning called for 500 personnel in residence at a time. By mid-1942, over six times that many were stationed at Tuskegee, even though only two squadrons were training there. War Bonds poster featuring a Tuskegee Airman Tuskegee Army Airfield was similar to already-existing airfields reserved for training white pilots, such as Maxwell Field, only 40 miles (64 km) distant. African-American contractor McKissack and McKissack, Inc. was in charge of the contract. The company's 2,000 workmen, the Alabama Works Progress Administration, and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months. The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057. The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis Jr., one of only two black line officers then serving. During training, Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison. Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee. However, he was transferred on 12 January 1942, reputedly because of his insistence that his African-American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local white civilians. His successor, Colonel Frederick Kimble, then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield. Contrary to new Army regulations, Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama, a policy that was resented by the airmen. Later that year, the Air Corps replaced Kimble. His replacement had been the director of training at Tuskegee Army Airfield, Major Noel F. Parrish. Counter to the prevalent racism of the day, Parrish was fair and open-minded and petitioned Washington to allow the Tuskegee Airmen to serve in combat. "", 'Training of African-American men as aviation medical examiners was conducted through correspondence courses, until 1943, when two black physicians were admitted to the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field, Texas. This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army. Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941 to 1949. At that time, the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years. Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa, Sicily, and other parts of Italy. The chief flight surgeon to the Tuskegee Airmen was Vance H. Marchbanks Jr., MD, a childhood friend of Benjamin Davis. ', 'After segregation in the military was ended in 1948 by President Harry S. Truman with Executive Order 9981, the veteran Tuskegee Airmen found themselves in high demand throughout the newly formed United States Air Force. Some taught in civilian flight schools, such as the black-owned Columbia Air Center in Maryland. On 11 May 1949, Air Force Letter 35.3 mandated that black Airmen be screened for reassignment to formerly all-white units according to qualifications. ', 'In World War II, the United States military was segregated, and African American service members faced discriminatory limitations in positions. The Army Air Corps was expanded by Public Law 18 in April 1939 and the demand for more pilots lead to the creation of the 99th Pursuit Squadron in 1941. In Tuskegee, Alabama, the U.S. Army Air Corp began a program to train African American servicemembers as Air Corps cadets. Instruction was provided by Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) and the U.S. Army. Flight training was provided primarily at Moton Field. African American pilots (about 1,000 aviators) and civilians in supporting operational roles (more than 15,000 persons) were involved in the efforts. By the end of the war, the Tuskegee Airmen had completed 1,578 combat missions, and the airmen received some of the highest honors in the Army Air Corps. The 99th Fighter Squadron (formerly known as the 99th Pursuit Squadron) would combine with the 100th, 301st and 302nd to form the 332nd Fighter Group.

This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army. Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941 to 1949. At that time, the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years. Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa, Sicily, and other parts of Italy. The chief flight surgeon to the Tuskegee Airmen was Vance H. Marchbanks Jr., MD, a childhood friend of Benjamin Davis. ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen\nAfter segregation in the military was ended in 1948 by President Harry S. Truman with Executive Order 9981, the veteran Tuskegee Airmen found themselves in high demand throughout the newly formed United States Air Force. Some taught in civilian flight schools, such as the black-owned Columbia Air Center in Maryland. On 11 May 1949, Air Force Letter 35.3 mandated that black Airmen be screened for reassignment to formerly all-white units according to qualifications.

The Army Air Corps was expanded by Public Law 18 in April 1939 and the demand for more pilots lead to the creation of the 99th Pursuit Squadron in 1941. In Tuskegee, Alabama, the U.S. Army Air Corp began a program to train African American servicemembers as Air Corps cadets. Instruction was provided by Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) and the U.S. Army. Flight training was provided primarily at Moton Field. African American pilots (about 1,000 aviators) and civilians in supporting operational roles (more than 15,000 persons) were involved in the efforts. By the end of the war, the Tuskegee Airmen had completed 1,578 combat missions, and the airmen received some of the highest honors in the Army Air Corps. The 99th Fighter Squadron (formerly known as the 99th Pursuit Squadron) would combine with the 100th, 301st and 302nd to form the 332nd Fighter Group. In 1998 Congress established the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Site. This lesson’s purpose is to connect students to the history of the place and the voices of servicemembers who trained there.

The reaction occurs when the red blood cells that were given during the transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system. When red blood cells are destroyed, the process is called hemolysis.There are other types of transfusion reactions that do not cause hemolysis, such as febrile (causing fever) transfusion reactions.Causes "", 'Transfusion of ABO major-incompatible red blood cells (RBCs) can activate the complement system and can cause severe and even lethal acute hemolytic reactions. The activation of the complement system with formation of C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins) and the release of hemoglobin from the lysed RBCs are thought to mediate clinical signs like fever, hypotension, pain, and acute renal failure. Therapeutic inhibition of the complement cascade in case of ABO-incompatible RBC transfusion would be desirable to ameliorate the signs and symptoms and to improve the outcome of the reaction. Study design and methods: A patient with blood group B was erroneously transfused with a unit of group A2 RBCs. Within 1 hour after transfusion she received eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the complement component C5 and blocks its cleavage. Clinical and immunohematologic observations are reported here. Results: ', ""RBC transfusions are used to treat hemorrhage and to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Transfusion of RBCs should be based on the patient's clinical condition.4 Indications for RBC transfusion include acute sickle cell crisis (for stroke prevention), or acute blood loss of greater than 1,500 mL or 30 percent of blood volume.4 Patients with symptomatic anemia should be transfused if they cannot function without treating the anemia.4 Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, reduced exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, changes in mental status, muscle cramps, and angina or severe congestive heart failure. The 10/30 rule—transfusion when a patient has a hemoglobin level less than or equal to 10 g per dL (100 g per L) and a hematocrit level less than or equal to 30 percent—was used until the 1980s as the trigger to transfuse, regardless of the patient's clinical presentation.4,5 "", ""Hemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by immune destruction of transfused RBCs, which are attacked by the recipient's antibodies. The antibodies to the antigens of the ABO blood group or alloantibodies to other RBC antigens are produced after immunization through a previous transfusion or pregnancy. There are two categories of hemolytic transfusion reactions: acute and delayed. Nonimmune causes of acute reactions include bacterial overgrowth, improper storing, infusion with incompatible medications, and infusion of blood through lines containing hypotonic solutions or small-bore intravenous tubes.16,18,19 In acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, there is a destruction of the donor's RBCs within 24 hours of transfusion. Hemolysis may be intravascular or extravascular. The most common type is extravascular hemolysis, which occurs when donor RBCs coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) or complement are attacked in the liver or spleen.17 Intravascular hemolysis is a severe form of hemolysis caused by ABO antibodies. Symptoms of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions include fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, hypotension, diffuse bleeding, hemoglobinuria, oliguria, anuria, pain at the infusion site; and chest, back, and abdominal pain.19 Associated complications are clinically significant anemia, acute or exacerbated renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, need for dialysis, and death secondary to complications.18 The incidence of acute hemolytic reactions is approximately one to five per 50,000 transfusions.19 From 1996 to 2007, there were 213 ABO-incompatible RBC transfusions with 24 deaths.17 Systems using bar codes for blood and patient identification have decreased errors.17 ALLERGIC REACTIONS Allergic reactions range from mild (urticarial) to life threatening (anaphylactic). Urticarial allergic reactions are defined by hives or pruritus.20 Patients experiencing allergic transfusion reactions have been sensitized to the antigens in the donor unit. These antigens are soluble, and the associated reaction is dose-dependent. Allergic transfusion reactions occur in 1 to 3 percent of transfusions.16 "", 'Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when ABO-incompatible blood is transfused, resulting in recipient antibodies attaching to donor RBC antigens and forming an antigen-antibody complex. This antigen-antibody complex activates complement, resulting in intravascular RBC lysis with release of RBC stroma and free Hb. Immune system activation also results in bradykinin release (leading to hypotension) and mast cell activation (causing serotonin and histamine release). The net result may be shock, renal failure due to Hb precipitation in renal tubules, and DIC. Many signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction appear immediately and include fever, chest pain, anxiety, back pain, and dyspnea. Many are masked by general anesthesia, but clues to the diagnosis include fever, hypotension, hemoglobinuria, unexplained bleeding, or failure of Hct to increase after transfusion. The incidence of fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction in the US is approximately 1 of every 250,000 to 1,000,000 units transfused. Most reactions occur because of administrative errors, with most due to improper identification of the blood unit or patient. The importance of adhering to strict policies of checking blood and matching to the correct patient in the operating room cannot be overemphasized. ', 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are the most common transfusion reactions, occurring in approximately 1% of RBC transfusions and up to 30% of platelet transfusions. They occur when anti-leukocyte antibodies in a recipient react with white blood cells in a transfused blood product. Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, tachycardia, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Approach to treatment involves first stopping the transfusion and excluding an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction or bacterial contamination of the donor unit. Acetaminophen and meperidine may diminish fever and rigors. Once the diagnosis of FNHTR has been made, future reactions may be avoided or diminished by administering leukocyte-reduced blood products, premedicating at-risk patients with acetaminophen and hydrocortisone and administering the transfusion slowly. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) ', 'Cause: Patients may develop antibodies to red cell antigens. Antibodies can occur naturally, or may arise as a consequence of previous transfusion or pregnancy. A delayed haemolytic reaction occurs when a patient develops an antibody directed against an antigen on transfused red cells. The antibody may cause shortened red cell survival, with clinical features of fever, jaundice and lower than expected haemoglobin following transfusion. Most delayed haemolytic reactions produce few symptoms and may go unrecognised, however there are reports of serious consequences in critically ill patients. Prevention: An antibody screen is performed as part of pre-transfusion testing. When an antibody is detected, it is identified and appropriate antigen negative blood is provided. Sometimes antibodies fall below detectable limits and may not be detected by pretransfusion testing. Alloimmunisation Red Blood Cells ', 'A hemolytic reaction happens when the body attacks the donated RBCs. This happens if a person gets a blood type that their blood isn’t compatible with. Donated blood goes through a very careful matching process, so this reaction is very rare. If it does happen, it can cause chills, fever, kidney damage, and other serious symptoms. Symptoms can happen during the blood transfusion or in the next several hours. A delayed hemolytic reaction can also happen. This can happen even if your child received the right blood type. This may take days or weeks to happen. It may not cause any symptoms, but it can cause your child’s RBC count to be lower. Too much blood in the body (transfusion overload).

Symptoms of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions include fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, hypotension, diffuse bleeding, hemoglobinuria, oliguria, anuria, pain at the infusion site; and chest, back, and abdominal pain.19 Associated complications are clinically significant anemia, acute or exacerbated renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, need for dialysis, and death secondary to complications.18 The incidence of acute hemolytic reactions is approximately one to five per 50,000 transfusions.19 From 1996 to 2007, there were 213 ABO-incompatible RBC transfusions with 24 deaths.17 Systems using bar codes for blood and patient identification have decreased errors.17 ALLERGIC REACTIONS Allergic reactions range from mild (urticarial) to life threatening (anaphylactic). Urticarial allergic reactions are defined by hives or pruritus.20 Patients experiencing allergic transfusion reactions have been sensitized to the antigens in the donor unit. These antigens are soluble, and the associated reaction is dose-dependent. Allergic transfusion reactions occur in 1 to 3 percent of transfusions.16 "", 'https://www.medstarhealth.org/news-and-publications/articles-and-research-reports/complications-of-blood-transfusion\n\x1b[102m[2] Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when ABO-incompatible blood is transfused, resulting in recipient antibodies attaching to donor RBC antigens and forming an antigen-antibody complex\x1b[0m. This antigen-antibody complex activates complement, resulting in \x1b[102m[3] intravascular RBC lysis with release of RBC stroma and free Hb\x1b[0m. Immune system activation also results in bradykinin release (leading to hypotension) and mast cell activation (causing serotonin and histamine release). The net result may be shock, renal failure due to Hb precipitation in renal tubules, and DIC. Many signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction appear immediately and include fever, chest pain, anxiety, back pain, and dyspnea. Many are masked by general anesthesia, but clues to the diagnosis include fever, hypotension, hemoglobinuria, unexplained bleeding, or failure of Hct to increase after transfusion. The incidence of fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction in the US is approximately 1 of every 250,000 to 1,000,000 units transfused. Most reactions occur because of administrative errors, with most due to improper identification of the blood unit or patient. The importance of adhering to strict policies of checking blood and matching to the correct patient in the operating room cannot be overemphasized.

49,21,"[""What precisely is American federalism? In their seminal work on federal jurisdiction, Felix Frankfurter and Wilber Katz allude to a 'dynamic struggle' between federal and state power, the ebb and flow of competing, sometimes conflicting, spheres of federal and state power and influence. In many respects, the story of American government is the story of how that struggle has been resolved. The antecedents of American federalism trace to colonial days, when the concept of divided sovereign power began to take shape. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies declared themselves to be free and independent states. During the hostilities and at the War’s end, the newly formed states recognized that they needed to operate together to function adequately on the new national stage and to enter the world stage. "", 'In their Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay promoted state ratification of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 9, Hamilton attempted to assuage the concerns that the states would lose sovereignty under the new Constitution: So long as the separate organization of the members be not abolished . . . though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty . . . and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power.25 In Federalist No. 51, Hamilton argued that federalism would help limit the ability of the proposed new central government to abuse its powers: ', ""and eight years after ratification of the Articles of Confederation, which established a league of sovereign states, the nation repealed the Articles of Confederation and ratified a new Constitution creating the United States. Since its ratification the Constitution, which established a union of states under a federal system of governance, two questions have generated considerable debate: What is the nature of the union? What powers, privileges, duties, and responsibilities does the Constitution grant to the national government and reserve to the states and to the people? During the 208-year history of the Constitution the answers to these questions have been debated time and again and have shaped and been shaped by the nation's political, social and economic history. What is federalism? According to James Q. Wilson and John DiIulio, Jr., it is a system of government 'in which sovereignty is shared [between two or more levels of government] so that on some matters the national government is supreme and on others the states, regions, or provincial governments are supreme.1 There are three essential features that characterize a federal system of governance. First, there must be a provision for more than one level of government to act simultaneously on the same territory and on the same citizens. The American federal system is composed of a national government and the 50 states, both recognized by the Constitution. Local governments, creations of states, while not mentioned in the Constitution, are nevertheless key players in American federalism. Their power to regulate and legislate is derived from state Constitutions. Second, each government must have its own authority and sphere of power, though they may overlap. When state and federal authority conflict, federal law is supreme under the Constitution. Article I, Sec. 8 of the Constitution delegates certain enumerated powers to the national government that includes "", 'In This Chapter Study PlanChapter OutlineDiagnostic/Quiz+ Multiple-Choice QuizzesVocabulary FlashcardsAnalyzing the Evidence ExercisesEbook Chapter 3Federalism and the Separation of Powers Chapter Study Outline Introduction One great achievement of the American founding was the creation of an effective constitutional structure of political institutions. Two important aspects of the U.S. Constitution—federalism and the separation of powers—represent, in part, the framers’ efforts to divide governmental power. Federalism limits government by creating two sovereign powers—the national government and state governments—thereby restraining the influence of both. Separation of powers imposes internal limits by dividing government against itself, giving different branches separate functions and forcing them to share power. Who Does What? Federalism and Institutional Jurisdictions ', ""Federalism also invulves some limitations on state authority, particularly invulving relationships between state governments. Local governments, while not recognized in the Constitution, are used by states in conducting the activities of government. Under the traditional system of 'dual federalism,' which lasted from 1789 to 1937, there was a relatively clear division of federal power, with the national government limiting itself primarily to promoting commerce (buttressed by cases such as McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden), while the states did most of the governing. "", ""Faced with the very real problems of a weak central government, Congress issued a resolution in February 1787 calling for a convention to amend the Articles of Confederation.  But at the Philadelphia convention, which opened on May 25, 1787, delegates quickly began to consider an entirely new form of government, federalism, which shared power between the states and a more robust central government with truly national powers.After four months, the delegates drastically changed the relationship among the states and created a new national government, abandoning the Articles of Confederation.  This new government had executive and judicial powers, along with expanded legislative authority.  Unlike the Confederation, states in the new legislature would not be represented equally.  Instead, big states with large populations exercised more power in Congress.  Slaveholding states were allowed to count three-fifths of their enslaved population for representation and taxation purposes.  To count slaves fully would only have increased the political power of slave states.On September 17, 1787, the delegates approved and signed an entirely new Constitution for the United States of America.  Once approved by the people, the Constitution's federal system would create a unique solution to sharing power among the states and the national government.  Even George Washington admitted that the Constitution was not perfect, but rather--in the words of its Preamble--the next step in 'a more perfect union.'Federalism content written by Linda R. Monk, Constitutional scholar "", ""(a) 'Policies that have federalism implications'' refers to regulations, legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. (b) 'State'' or 'States'' refer to the States of the United States of America, individually or collectively, and, where relevant, to State governments, including units of local government and other political subdivisions established by the States. Sec. 2. Fundamental Federalism Principles. In formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications, Executive departments and agencies shall be guided by the following fundamental federalism principles: (a) Federalism is rooted in the knowledge that our political liberties are best assured by limiting the size and scope of the national government. "", ""At the Federal Convention of 1787, now known as the Constitutional Convention, the framers of the United States Constitution established in Article I the structure and powers of Congress. The delegates who gathered in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787, first to revise the existing form of government and then to frame a new Constitution, debated the idea of a Congress made up of two houses. One house would be, in the words of Virginia’s George Mason, the 'grand depository of the democratic principle of government.' To counter this popular influence in the national government, James Madison of Virginia proposed another house that would be small, deliberative, and independent from the larger, more democratic house. This became the Senate. "", 'Federalism can be found in a number of areas in the US Constitution. It is perhaps most clear through the use of enumerated powers, clearly allocating responsibilities to the Federal Government and responsibilities to the State Governments. In addition to this, it is also shown through the concurrent and implied powers.

In their seminal work on federal jurisdiction, Felix Frankfurter and Wilber Katz allude to a 'dynamic struggle' between federal and state power, the ebb and flow of competing, sometimes conflicting, spheres of federal and state power and influence. In many respects, the story of American government is the story of how that struggle has been resolved. The antecedents of American federalism trace to colonial days, when the concept of divided sovereign power began to take shape. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies declared themselves to be free and independent states. During the hostilities and at the War’s end, the newly formed states recognized that they needed to operate together to function adequately on the new national stage and to enter the world stage. "", 'https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/foundations-of-u-s-federalism/\nIn their Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay promoted state ratification of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 9, Hamilton attempted to assuage the concerns that the states would lose sovereignty under the new Constitution: So long as the separate organization of the members be not abolished . . . though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty . . . and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power.25 In Federalist No. 51, Hamilton argued that federalism would help limit the ability of the proposed new central government to abuse its powers: ', ""https://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/gov/federal.htm\nand eight years after ratification of the Articles of Confederation, which established a league of sovereign states, the nation repealed the Articles of Confederation and ratified a new Constitution creating the United States. Since its ratification the Constitution, which established a union of states under a federal system of governance, two questions have generated considerable debate: What is the nature of the union? What powers, privileges, duties, and responsibilities does the Constitution grant to the national government and reserve to the states and to the people? During the 208-year history of the Constitution the answers to these questions have been debated time and again and have shaped and been shaped by the nation's political, social and economic history. What is federalism? According to James Q. Wilson and John DiIulio, Jr., it is a system of government 'in which sovereignty is shared [between two or more levels of government] so that on some matters the national government is supreme and on others the states, regions, or provincial governments are supreme.1 There are three essential features that characterize a federal system of governance. First, there must be a provision for more than one level of government to act simultaneously on the same territory and on the same citizens. The American federal system is composed of a national government and the 50 states, both recognized by the Constitution. Local governments, creations of states, while not mentioned in the Constitution, are nevertheless key players in American federalism. Their power to regulate and legislate is derived from state Constitutions. Second, each government must have its own authority and sphere of power, though they may overlap. When state and federal authority conflict, federal law is supreme under the Constitution. Article I, Sec. 8 of the Constitution delegates certain enumerated powers to the national government that includes "", 'https://wwnorton.com/college/polisci/american-government12/brief/ch/03/outline.aspx\nIn This Chapter Study PlanChapter OutlineDiagnostic/Quiz+ Multiple-Choice QuizzesVocabulary FlashcardsAnalyzing the Evidence ExercisesEbook Chapter 3Federalism and the Separation of Powers Chapter Study Outline Introduction One great achievement of the American founding was the creation of an effective constitutional structure of political institutions. Two important aspects of the U.S. Constitution—federalism and the separation of powers—represent, in part, the framers’ efforts to divide governmental power. Federalism limits government by creating two sovereign powers—the national government and state governments—thereby restraining the influence of both. Separation of powers imposes internal limits by dividing government against itself, giving different branches separate functions and forcing them to share power. Who Does What? Federalism and Institutional Jurisdictions ', ""https://wwnorton.com/college/polisci/american-government12/brief/ch/03/outline.aspx\nFederalism also invulves some limitations on state authority, particularly invulving relationships between state governments. Local governments, while not recognized in the Constitution, are used by states in conducting the activities of government. Under the traditional system of 'dual federalism,' which lasted from 1789 to 1937, there was a relatively clear division of federal power, with the national government limiting itself primarily to promoting commerce (buttressed by cases such as McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden), while the states did most of the governing. "", ""https://www.pbs.org/tpt/constitution-usa-peter-sagal/federalism/\nFaced with the very real problems of a weak central government, Congress issued a resolution in February 1787 calling for a convention to amend the Articles of Confederation.  But at the Philadelphia convention, which opened on May 25, 1787, delegates quickly began to consider an entirely new form of government, federalism, which shared power between the states and a more robust central government with truly national powers.After four months, the delegates drastically changed the relationship among the states and created a new national government, abandoning the Articles of Confederation.  This new government had executive and judicial powers, along with expanded legislative authority.  Unlike the Confederation, states in the new legislature would not be represented equally.  Instead, big states with large populations exercised more power in Congress.  Slaveholding states were allowed to count three-fifths of their enslaved population for representation and taxation purposes.  To count slaves fully would only have increased the political power of slave states.On September 17, 1787, the delegates approved and signed an entirely new Constitution for the United States of America.  Once approved by the people, the Constitution's federal system would create a unique solution to sharing power among the states and the national government.  Even George Washington admitted that the Constitution was not perfect, but rather--in the words of its Preamble--the next step in 'a more perfect union.'Federalism content written by Linda R. Monk, Constitutional scholar "", ""https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/executive-order-12612-federalism\n(a) 'Policies that have federalism implications'' refers to regulations, legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. (b) 'State'' or 'States'' refer to the States of the United States of America, individually or collectively, and, where relevant, to State governments, including units of local government and other political subdivisions established by the States. Sec. 2. Fundamental Federalism Principles. In formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications, Executive departments and agencies shall be guided by the following fundamental federalism principles: (a) Federalism is rooted in the knowledge that our political liberties are best assured by limiting the size and scope of the national government. "", ""https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution.htm\nAt the Federal Convention of 1787, now known as the Constitutional Convention, the framers of the United States Constitution established in Article I the structure and powers of Congress. The delegates who gathered in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787, first to revise the existing form of government and then to frame a new Constitution, debated the idea of a Congress made up of two houses. One house would be, in the words of Virginia’s George Mason, the 'grand depository of the democratic principle of government.' To counter this popular influence in the national government, James Madison of Virginia proposed another house that would be small, deliberative, and independent from the larger, more democratic house. This became the Senate.

The reaction occurs when the red blood cells that were given during the transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system. When red blood cells are destroyed, the process is called hemolysis.There are other types of transfusion reactions that do not cause hemolysis, such as febrile (causing fever) transfusion reactions.Causes "", 'Transfusion of ABO major-incompatible red blood cells (RBCs) can activate the complement system and can cause severe and even lethal acute hemolytic reactions. The activation of the complement system with formation of C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins) and the release of hemoglobin from the lysed RBCs are thought to mediate clinical signs like fever, hypotension, pain, and acute renal failure. Therapeutic inhibition of the complement cascade in case of ABO-incompatible RBC transfusion would be desirable to ameliorate the signs and symptoms and to improve the outcome of the reaction. Study design and methods: A patient with blood group B was erroneously transfused with a unit of group A2 RBCs. Within 1 hour after transfusion she received eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the complement component C5 and blocks its cleavage. Clinical and immunohematologic observations are reported here. Results: ', ""RBC transfusions are used to treat hemorrhage and to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Transfusion of RBCs should be based on the patient's clinical condition.4 Indications for RBC transfusion include acute sickle cell crisis (for stroke prevention), or acute blood loss of greater than 1,500 mL or 30 percent of blood volume.4 Patients with symptomatic anemia should be transfused if they cannot function without treating the anemia.4 Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, reduced exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, changes in mental status, muscle cramps, and angina or severe congestive heart failure. The 10/30 rule—transfusion when a patient has a hemoglobin level less than or equal to 10 g per dL (100 g per L) and a hematocrit level less than or equal to 30 percent—was used until the 1980s as the trigger to transfuse, regardless of the patient's clinical presentation.4,5 "", ""Hemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by immune destruction of transfused RBCs, which are attacked by the recipient's antibodies. The antibodies to the antigens of the ABO blood group or alloantibodies to other RBC antigens are produced after immunization through a previous transfusion or pregnancy. There are two categories of hemolytic transfusion reactions: acute and delayed. Nonimmune causes of acute reactions include bacterial overgrowth, improper storing, infusion with incompatible medications, and infusion of blood through lines containing hypotonic solutions or small-bore intravenous tubes.16,18,19 In acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, there is a destruction of the donor's RBCs within 24 hours of transfusion. Hemolysis may be intravascular or extravascular. The most common type is extravascular hemolysis, which occurs when donor RBCs coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) or complement are attacked in the liver or spleen.17 Intravascular hemolysis is a severe form of hemolysis caused by ABO antibodies. Symptoms of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions include fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, hypotension, diffuse bleeding, hemoglobinuria, oliguria, anuria, pain at the infusion site; and chest, back, and abdominal pain.19 Associated complications are clinically significant anemia, acute or exacerbated renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, need for dialysis, and death secondary to complications.18 The incidence of acute hemolytic reactions is approximately one to five per 50,000 transfusions.19 From 1996 to 2007, there were 213 ABO-incompatible RBC transfusions with 24 deaths.17 Systems using bar codes for blood and patient identification have decreased errors.17 ALLERGIC REACTIONS Allergic reactions range from mild (urticarial) to life threatening (anaphylactic). Urticarial allergic reactions are defined by hives or pruritus.20 Patients experiencing allergic transfusion reactions have been sensitized to the antigens in the donor unit. These antigens are soluble, and the associated reaction is dose-dependent. Allergic transfusion reactions occur in 1 to 3 percent of transfusions.16 "", 'Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when ABO-incompatible blood is transfused, resulting in recipient antibodies attaching to donor RBC antigens and forming an antigen-antibody complex. This antigen-antibody complex activates complement, resulting in intravascular RBC lysis with release of RBC stroma and free Hb. Immune system activation also results in bradykinin release (leading to hypotension) and mast cell activation (causing serotonin and histamine release). The net result may be shock, renal failure due to Hb precipitation in renal tubules, and DIC. Many signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction appear immediately and include fever, chest pain, anxiety, back pain, and dyspnea. Many are masked by general anesthesia, but clues to the diagnosis include fever, hypotension, hemoglobinuria, unexplained bleeding, or failure of Hct to increase after transfusion. The incidence of fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction in the US is approximately 1 of every 250,000 to 1,000,000 units transfused. Most reactions occur because of administrative errors, with most due to improper identification of the blood unit or patient. The importance of adhering to strict policies of checking blood and matching to the correct patient in the operating room cannot be overemphasized. ', 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are the most common transfusion reactions, occurring in approximately 1% of RBC transfusions and up to 30% of platelet transfusions. They occur when anti-leukocyte antibodies in a recipient react with white blood cells in a transfused blood product. Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, tachycardia, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Approach to treatment involves first stopping the transfusion and excluding an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction or bacterial contamination of the donor unit. Acetaminophen and meperidine may diminish fever and rigors. Once the diagnosis of FNHTR has been made, future reactions may be avoided or diminished by administering leukocyte-reduced blood products, premedicating at-risk patients with acetaminophen and hydrocortisone and administering the transfusion slowly. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) ', 'Cause: Patients may develop antibodies to red cell antigens. Antibodies can occur naturally, or may arise as a consequence of previous transfusion or pregnancy. A delayed haemolytic reaction occurs when a patient develops an antibody directed against an antigen on transfused red cells. The antibody may cause shortened red cell survival, with clinical features of fever, jaundice and lower than expected haemoglobin following transfusion. Most delayed haemolytic reactions produce few symptoms and may go unrecognised, however there are reports of serious consequences in critically ill patients. Prevention: An antibody screen is performed as part of pre-transfusion testing. When an antibody is detected, it is identified and appropriate antigen negative blood is provided. Sometimes antibodies fall below detectable limits and may not be detected by pretransfusion testing.

The incidence of fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction in the US is approximately 1 of every 250,000 to 1,000,000 units transfused. Most reactions occur because of administrative errors, with most due to improper identification of the blood unit or patient. The importance of adhering to strict policies of checking blood and matching to the correct patient in the operating room cannot be overemphasized.

51,19,"[""Dragon Ball Z Kai, known in Japan as Dragon Ball Kai (ドラゴンボール改, Doragon Bōru Kai, lit. Dragon Ball Revised), is an anime series that is a high-definition remastered and recut of Dragon Ball Z, done for its 20th Anniversary. It premiered on Fuji TV on April 5, 2009, at 9:00 am just before One Piece and ended initially on March 27, 2011, with 97 episodes (a 98th episode was later released straight-to-video), and the two shows were marketed together as 'Dream 9', which refers to the hour in which they both aired. The series average rating was 9.4%, with its maximum being 12.3% (Episode 47) and its minimum being 6.4% (Episode 18). Dragon Ball Kai returned to Japanese TV on April 6, 2014, with the Majin Buu Saga, and ended its run for the second and last time on June 28, 2015, with 61 episodes while the original uncut international version would go on to have 69 episodes (bringing the total episode count of the series to 159 for the original Japanese broadcast and 167 for the extended International broadcast).[1] "", 'For the Androids Saga, the animation in the opening scene and closing credits have been altered a bit to fit the current storyline. New animations of Dr. Gero, Android 19, Android 17, Android 18, Android 16, and Cell appear, as well as the Super Saiyan appearances of Goku, Vegeta, Future Trunks, and Gohan. The new intro also showcases battles taking place within the saga, such as Vegeta vs. #18, Piccolo vs. #17, #16 vs. Cell, Goku vs. Cell, and ends showing a sequence of the Dragon Team standing together with their Cell Saga appearances. The ending credits are also different, showcasing Goku flying with Shenron as the faces of the main cast appear. He proceeds to transform into a Super Saiyan and the cast joins him in flight. The sequence ends with the Z Fighters standing in front of the Earth, with Shenron and Porunga in the backdrop. ', ""Happinet (the Japanese company releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray) announced the Japanese DVD and Blu-ray release would have an end point of '98 Episodes (tentative)' meaning the planned and announced episode count would end at 99.[12] Actually, Dragon Ball Kai was supposed to last for 98 episodes, but everything had originally been thrown off an entire week due to the horrific tsunami that struck Japan the prior week. The series temporarily ended with 97 episodes aired, and the 98th episode was released direct-to-video. A few years later, the series returned with 61 Majin Buu Saga episodes in Japan.[1] English adaptations Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' logo The title screen translations are far more similar this time around, but are changed to fit properly into English. Edits were made to the version appearing on Nicktoons, including the removal of blood (which was sometimes replaced with black grayish liquid where the blood is supposed to be), overly violent moments, profanity and others. The CW's Toonzai airings, however, were edited even more so than the Nicktoons version, due to tighter restrictions on broadcast programming. These edits include recoloring Mr. Popo's skin from black to blue, replacing dead characters' halos with glowing orbs, removing virtually all references to death in both dialogue and episode titles, and renaming certain special techniques (i.e. Goku's Spirit Bomb renamed as the 'Spirit Blast' and Vegeta's Galick Gun as the 'Galick Blast'). Also in the beginning of the intro song, Toonzai edited out Shenron and replaced him with a green colored sky. When Toonzai became Vortexx, these edits remained but the halos/glowing orbs were removed altogether. On Nicktoons, the series aired from May 24, 2010 to February 8, 2013; on Toonzai/Vortexx, the series aired from August 14, 2010 to September 27, 2014 when the block was cancelled. Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' promotional image The series returned with the 69 Majin Buu Saga episodes in 2014 in Europe, carrying the sub-title 'The Final Chapters'. This remastered and reedited series was broadcasted in the UK on Kix, in Portugal on Sic Radical, in Poland on AXN Spin, and in France on Game One. On May 25, 2014, Funimation and Adult Swim announced that the English dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai would air uncut on Adult Swim's Toonami block starting in fall 2014.[6] The show began airing at 12:00 AM on November 8, 2014, replacing Bleach. Starting on February 21, 2015, a rerun of the previous weeks episode began airing at 8:00 PM on Saturdays outside of the Toonami block, with a new episode at its 12:00 AM time slot as part of Toonami. "", ""Dragon Ball Z uses four pieces of theme music in the Japanese version. From episodes 1–199, the opening theme is 'Cha-La Head-Cha-La' by Hironobu Kageyama, and the closing theme is 'Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Pawā!' by MANNA. From episodes 200–291, the opening and closing themes are 'We Gotta Power' and 'Boku-Tachi wa Tenshi Datta,' both by Hironobu Kageyama. Series overview In Japan, Dragon Ball Z was aired year-round continuously, with regular off-days for sporting events and television specials taking place about once every six weeks on average. The English broadcast was divided into eight separate near-continuous blocks with breaks varying between four months to over a year between each block. Only in one instance, between episodes 194 and 195, was there actually parity between the DVD release and the actual broadcast sequence in terms of the end of one 'season' and the beginning of the next. "", ""Vegeta acknowledging his rival as he fought Kid Buu was a defining moment for Vegeta's character growth. The final Spirit Bomb that Goku launches on Kid Buu is also pretty great to witness in its own right. 3 Everyone Vs Frieza Episodes: 77-86 The Z Warriors put everything on the line to survive Frieza's relentless assault For what it’s worth, the fight against Frieza starts off well-paced enough in the anime. The first 8 episodes are dedicated to everything before Goku shows up, which actually does have a fair bit of material to adapt – perhaps not 8 episodes’ worth, but it’s not an unreasonable number when taking into account how much of an endurance match the battle with Frieza is. Problems start to arise when you look at the arc in perspective, however. Along with these initial 8 episodes, the final fight against Frieza lasts nearly 30 episodes in Dragon Ball Z. That’s over half a year of syndication for a single battle. In the grand scheme of things, it’s simply too much. "", 'The original Dragon Ball finds the perfect length that’s neither too cumbersome nor brief, which is appropriate as Toriyama tests the waters and sees what audiences think of this heightened world. Dragon Ball, as a manga, ran for 194 chapters, which has been compiled into 16 volumes. It’s a respectable length for a starter shonen series. Alternatively, Dragon Ball’s anime adaptation is 153 episodes and it doesn’t stray very far from its source material. There are a handful of filler episodes, but the Dragon Ball anime is quite faithful to its manga and doesn’t indulge in any wild detours. There was originally no official delineation between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z in Toriyama’s manga. Chapter 196 just kicked off with a five-year time-jump that ushers in Goku’s adult adventures, now with a family and young child. Dragon Ball saw plenty of success, but Dragon Ball Z catapulted this fame to new heights with a greater emphasis on action, ki-based combat, and powerful transformations. Dragon Ball Z is significantly longer than its predecessor and it makes up the majority of the Dragon Ball franchise. The manga ran for 325 chapters across 26 volumes, which brings it and the original Dragon Ball to a combined 519 chapters of material. Dragon Ball Z’s anime is also not one for brevity and it nearly doubles the original series’ episode count at 291. Dragon Ball Z doesn’t remove any of its manga’s storylines, but it does get more indulgent with filler material, particularly when it comes to extending fights. ', ""Dragon Ball Super changed fans' standard of quality. It also made them reconsider Dragon Ball GT and wonder whether it was a good show. Dragon Ball Super is the latest canonical Dragon Ball entry and it continues to turn out new content and contribute to the greater Dragon Ball lore. Dragon Ball Super was developed as an alternate sequel series to Dragon Ball Z that disregards Dragon Ball GT. However, Dragon Ball Super is curiously set right after Kid Buu’s defeat. This means that the entire series takes place before Dragon Ball Z’s Peaceful World Saga ending, which turns the clock forward ten years for its epilogue, which is set at the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament. Dragon Ball Super has crammed a tremendous amount into this ten-year window, even if some of it pushes the limits of incredulity. Dragon Ball Super produced 131 episodes before its relatively abrupt finale during the Tournament of Power’s conclusion.

Installation of a Speed Feedback sign is optional, but if used it should be installed in conjunction with a Speed Limit sign.15 Speed Feedback signs are particularly useful at speed reductions where drivers have been traveling for some time at a higher speed. The phenomenon known as 'speed adaptation' causes drivers to underestimate their actual operating speeds in these instances, and the Speed Feedback sign can assist them in achieving the necessary speed reduction. Speed Feedback signs may be permanent or temporary installations. However, permanent installations are usually restricted to selected locations since a proliferation of Speed Feedback signs could lessen the effectiveness of the signs when they are needed most.

Speed must be decreased as necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway. Enforcement The Illinois State Police utilizes hand-held radar, moving radar, pacing, laser speed measurement devices, photo speed enforcement and air speed measurement to determine the speed of vehicles. The first mechanical means to measure vehicle speed was the stop watch.

If a special speed regulation exists, that posted speed limit will always supersede a statutory speed limit within a thickly settled or business district. Advisory Speeds: Speeds that are recommended safe driving speeds to alert drivers of the maximum recommended speed through a curve, a winding road, or for other special road conditions.  Advisory speeds are not enforceable since their intent is to advise motorists of an appropriate speed, not regulate it. Work Zone Speed Limits: Speed limits within construction work zones are set to improve traffic flow and improve safety for motorists and construction personnel.  Reduced speed limits are based on conditions such as lane closures, narrow lanes, unexpected changes to geometry, and other potential hazards.  Speeding violations in work zones are subject to double fines. ', ""Digital speed limit signs have replaced some standard speed signs in Oregon. The digital signs use road, weather, traffic and visibility sensors to lower the speed limit when conditions require drivers to slow down. The digital displays may also show the reason for a reduced speed. There are two types of digital variable speed signs: Variable Advisory Speed: Variable advisory speed signs are yellow and say, 'advisory speed.' These signs recommend a speed based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). These signs are turned on and off as needed. These are not speed limits, but police may enforce them through the basic rule law. Variable Speed Limit: Variable speed limit signs are black and white and say, 'speed limit.' These signs change the speed limit based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). Police may enforce these signs like any other speed limit sign.Variable speed signs, based on specific conditions, work to improve safety and reduce the chance of a collision by: Improving Line of Sight: In poor weather conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, or snow, slower speeds give drivers more time to react to obstacles or hazards that may be difficult to see.

Solid yellow lineMarks the left edge of one-way roads and ramps. Broken yellow center lineIndicates a two-way road used for traffic traveling in opposite directions. Passing is allowed for both directions of travel. Double center line consisting of a solid yellow line and broken yellow lineIndicates where passing is allowed.

These studies include roadway conditions, accident records and the prevailing speed of prudent drivers. If an unreasonably low speed is posted, most drivers will ignore the signs, while a few may try to stay within the posted speed limit. This causes real safety concerns because of the difference between faster and slower drivers. Setting unrealistically low speed limits... ... has two adverse effects. They make violators out of reasonable and otherwise law-abiding citizens. Most importantly, police enforcement is diminished, which plays a vital role in controlling the speed limit. Unrealistic speed limits create a difficult situation for the police and the community and citations are not upheld in court. Often the police will not return to the site to reinforce the law.

Installation of a Speed Feedback sign is optional, but if used it should be installed in conjunction with a Speed Limit sign.15 Speed Feedback signs are particularly useful at speed reductions where drivers have been traveling for some time at a higher speed. The phenomenon known as 'speed adaptation' causes drivers to underestimate their actual operating speeds in these instances, and the Speed Feedback sign can assist them in achieving the necessary speed reduction. Speed Feedback signs may be permanent or temporary installations. However, permanent installations are usually restricted to selected locations since a proliferation of Speed Feedback signs could lessen the effectiveness of the signs when they are needed most.

Advisory Speeds: Speeds that are recommended safe driving speeds to alert drivers of the maximum recommended speed through a curve, a winding road, or for other special road conditions.  Advisory speeds are not enforceable since their intent is to advise motorists of an appropriate speed, not regulate it. Work Zone Speed Limits: Speed limits within construction work zones are set to improve traffic flow and improve safety for motorists and construction personnel.  Reduced speed limits are based on conditions such as lane closures, narrow lanes, unexpected changes to geometry, and other potential hazards.

The digital signs use road, weather, traffic and visibility sensors to lower the speed limit when conditions require drivers to slow down. The digital displays may also show the reason for a reduced speed. There are two types of digital variable speed signs: Variable Advisory Speed: Variable advisory speed signs are yellow and say, 'advisory speed.' These signs recommend a speed based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). These signs are turned on and off as needed. These are not speed limits, but police may enforce them through the basic rule law. Variable Speed Limit: Variable speed limit signs are black and white and say, 'speed limit.' These signs change the speed limit based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). Police may enforce these signs like any other speed limit sign.Variable speed signs, based on specific conditions, work to improve safety and reduce the chance of a collision by: Improving Line of Sight: In poor weather conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, or snow, slower speeds give drivers more time to react to obstacles or hazards that may be difficult to see.

These studies include roadway conditions, accident records and the prevailing speed of prudent drivers. If an unreasonably low speed is posted, most drivers will ignore the signs, while a few may try to stay within the posted speed limit. This causes real safety concerns because of the difference between faster and slower drivers. Setting unrealistically low speed limits... ... has two adverse effects. They make violators out of reasonable and otherwise law-abiding citizens. Most importantly, police enforcement is diminished, which plays a vital role in controlling the speed limit.

If the rights provided by Constitution especially the Fundamental rights are violated the Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue writs under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, respectively, directing the State Machinery for enforcement of the fundamental rights. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms where every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality and life. These rights apply universally to all citizens of India, irrespective of their race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to certain restrictions. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. Fundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices.

Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may be imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences and defamation. The State is also empowered, in the interests of the general public to nationalize any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens. The freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are further sought to be protected by Articles 20–22. The scope of these articles, particularly with respect to the doctrine of due process, was heavily debated by the Constituent Assembly. It was argued, especially by Benegal Narsing Rau, that the incorporation of such a clause would hamper social legislation and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order, and therefore it ought to be excluded from the Constitution altogether. The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase 'due process' in favor of 'procedure established by law'. As a result, Article 21, which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by law, was, until 1978, construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action. However, in 1978, the Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action, holding that any law laying down a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable, and effectively reading due process into Article 21. In the same case, the Supreme Court also ruled that 'life' under Article 21 meant more than a mere 'animal existence'; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life 'meaningful, complete and worth living'. Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood, good health, clean environment, water, speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned.

Dragon Ball Kai returned to Japanese TV on April 6, 2014, with the Majin Buu Saga, and ended its run for the second and last time on June 28, 2015, with 61 episodes while the original uncut international version would go on to have 69 episodes (bringing the total episode count of the series to 159 for the original Japanese broadcast and 167 for the extended International broadcast).[1] "", 'For the Androids Saga, the animation in the opening scene and closing credits have been altered a bit to fit the current storyline.

The new intro also showcases battles taking place within the saga, such as Vegeta vs. #18, Piccolo vs. #17, #16 vs. Cell, Goku vs. Cell, and ends showing a sequence of the Dragon Team standing together with their Cell Saga appearances. The ending credits are also different, showcasing Goku flying with Shenron as the faces of the main cast appear. He proceeds to transform into a Super Saiyan and the cast joins him in flight.

The series temporarily ended with 97 episodes aired, and the 98th episode was released direct-to-video. A few years later, the series returned with 61 Majin Buu Saga episodes in Japan.[1] English adaptations Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' logo The title screen translations are far more similar this time around, but are changed to fit properly into English. Edits were made to the version appearing on Nicktoons, including the removal of blood (which was sometimes replaced with black grayish liquid where the blood is supposed to be), overly violent moments, profanity and others. The CW's Toonzai airings, however, were edited even more so than the Nicktoons version, due to tighter restrictions on broadcast programming. These edits include recoloring Mr. Popo's skin from black to blue, replacing dead characters' halos with glowing orbs, removing virtually all references to death in both dialogue and episode titles, and renaming certain special techniques (i.e. Goku's Spirit Bomb renamed as the 'Spirit Blast' and Vegeta's Galick Gun as the 'Galick Blast'). Also in the beginning of the intro song, Toonzai edited out Shenron and replaced him with a green colored sky. When Toonzai became Vortexx, these edits remained but the halos/glowing orbs were removed altogether. On Nicktoons, the series aired from May 24, 2010 to February 8, 2013; on Toonzai/Vortexx, the series aired from August 14, 2010 to September 27, 2014 when the block was cancelled. Dragon Ball Z Kai, 'The Final Chapters' promotional image The series returned with the 69 Majin Buu Saga episodes in 2014 in Europe, carrying the sub-title 'The Final Chapters'. This remastered and reedited series was broadcasted in the UK on Kix, in Portugal on Sic Radical, in Poland on AXN Spin, and in France on Game One. On May 25, 2014, Funimation and Adult Swim announced that the English dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai would air uncut on Adult Swim's Toonami block starting in fall 2014.[6] The show began airing at 12:00 AM on November 8, 2014, replacing Bleach. Starting on February 21, 2015, a rerun of the previous weeks episode began airing at 8:00 PM on Saturdays outside of the Toonami block, with a new episode at its 12:00 AM time slot as part of Toonami. "", ""Dragon Ball Z uses four pieces of theme music in the Japanese version. From episodes 1–199, the opening theme is 'Cha-La Head-Cha-La' by Hironobu Kageyama, and the closing theme is 'Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Pawā!' by MANNA. From episodes 200–291, the opening and closing themes are 'We Gotta Power' and 'Boku-Tachi wa Tenshi Datta,' both by Hironobu Kageyama. Series overview In Japan, Dragon Ball Z was aired year-round continuously, with regular off-days for sporting events and television specials taking place about once every six weeks on average. The English broadcast was divided into eight separate near-continuous blocks with breaks varying between four months to over a year between each block. Only in one instance, between episodes 194 and 195, was there actually parity between the DVD release and the actual broadcast sequence in terms of the end of one 'season' and the beginning of the next. "", ""Vegeta acknowledging his rival as he fought Kid Buu was a defining moment for Vegeta's character growth. The final Spirit Bomb that Goku launches on Kid Buu is also pretty great to witness in its own right. 3 Everyone Vs Frieza Episodes: 77-86 The Z Warriors put everything on the line to survive Frieza's relentless assault For what it’s worth, the fight against Frieza starts off well-paced enough in the anime. The first 8 episodes are dedicated to everything before Goku shows up, which actually does have a fair bit of material to adapt – perhaps not 8 episodes’ worth, but it’s not an unreasonable number when taking into account how much of an endurance match the battle with Frieza is. Problems start to arise when you look at the arc in perspective, however. Along with these initial 8 episodes, the final fight against Frieza lasts nearly 30 episodes in Dragon Ball Z. That’s over half a year of syndication for a single battle. In the grand scheme of things, it’s simply too much. "", 'The original Dragon Ball finds the perfect length that’s neither too cumbersome nor brief, which is appropriate as Toriyama tests the waters and sees what audiences think of this heightened world. Dragon Ball, as a manga, ran for 194 chapters, which has been compiled into 16 volumes. It’s a respectable length for a starter shonen series. Alternatively, Dragon Ball’s anime adaptation is 153 episodes and it doesn’t stray very far from its source material. There are a handful of filler episodes, but the Dragon Ball anime is quite faithful to its manga and doesn’t indulge in any wild detours. There was originally no official delineation between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z in Toriyama’s manga. Chapter 196 just kicked off with a five-year time-jump that ushers in Goku’s adult adventures, now with a family and young child. Dragon Ball saw plenty of success, but Dragon Ball Z catapulted this fame to new heights with a greater emphasis on action, ki-based combat, and powerful transformations. Dragon Ball Z is significantly longer than its predecessor and it makes up the majority of the Dragon Ball franchise. The manga ran for 325 chapters across 26 volumes, which brings it and the original Dragon Ball to a combined 519 chapters of material. Dragon Ball Z’s anime is also not one for brevity and it nearly doubles the original series’ episode count at 291. Dragon Ball Z doesn’t remove any of its manga’s storylines, but it does get more indulgent with filler material, particularly when it comes to extending fights. ', ""Dragon Ball Super changed fans' standard of quality. It also made them reconsider Dragon Ball GT and wonder whether it was a good show. Dragon Ball Super is the latest canonical Dragon Ball entry and it continues to turn out new content and contribute to the greater Dragon Ball lore. Dragon Ball Super was developed as an alternate sequel series to Dragon Ball Z that disregards Dragon Ball GT. However, Dragon Ball Super is curiously set right after Kid Buu’s defeat. This means that the entire series takes place before Dragon Ball Z’s Peaceful World Saga ending, which turns the clock forward ten years for its epilogue, which is set at the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament. Dragon Ball Super has crammed a tremendous amount into this ten-year window, even if some of it pushes the limits of incredulity. Dragon Ball Super produced 131 episodes before its relatively abrupt finale during the Tournament of Power’s conclusion.

Janet Yellen became the first woman secretary of the Treasury in 2021. Women Start Work in the Treasury But before women could get to historic roles at the top, their predecessors started on the bottom rungs of Treasury Department job ladders in the nation’s early years. "", ""https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/ventris-c-gibson-confirmed-as-40th-director-of-the-united-states-mint\nDirector Gibson becomes the 40th Director of the Mint. She is the first African-American to serve as Director, and the seventh woman to serve in this position. 'I am honored and humbled to be confirmed as Director of the Mint,' said Gibson. 'Since joining the Mint last October, I have been tremendously impressed by the dedication and professionalism of its workforce, and the outstanding quality of the circulation coins, bullion coins, and numismatic products made by the Mint.' Director Gibson is a U.S. Navy veteran who joined the Mint from the District of Columbia government, where she served as the Director of Human Resources. In this role, Ms. Gibson provided executive oversight and execution of human capital programs and services for nearly 37,000 employees. Prior to that, she served as Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Resources in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. She was responsible for the development, articulation, and delivery of Department-wide human resources policies, plans, and programs. During a career spanning more than 40 years in human resources executive and professional positions, Director Gibson earned numerous awards and commendations. She received an Exceptional Service and a Meritorious Service Award from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, an Exceptional Service Award from the Secretary of Transportation, FAA Manager Association’s Leadership Award, National Hispanic Coalition’s President’s Award, and the Northern New Jersey Metropolitan Area’s prestigious 'Woman of the Year' award. A graduate of the Federal Executive Institute, Executive Technique, and Aspen Institute, Director Gibson attended the University of Maryland, University College. She has three children and four grandchildren. About the United States Mint Congress created the United States Mint in 1792, and the Mint became part of the Department of the Treasury in 1873. As the Nation’s sole manufacturer of legal tender coinage, the Mint is responsible for producing circulating coinage for the Nation to conduct its trade and commerce. The Mint also produces numismatic products, including proof, uncirculated, and commemorative coins; Congressional Gold Medals; silver and bronze medals; and silver and gold bullion coins. Its numismatic programs are self-sustaining and operate at no cost to taxpayers. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES: Visit https://www.usmint.gov/about for information about the United States Mint.

When the position of the director is vacant, the senior career (non-political) official of the mint serves as the acting director. Until the appointment of Ryder as director, the Mint had been without an official director since the resignation of Edmund C. Moy in 2011. Richard A. Peterson succeeded Moy. Peterson served between January 2011 and March 2017. The longest serving director was Nellie Ross. Ross, who had earlier been the first female governor in American history while serving the state of Wyoming, was director from 1933 until 1953. In July 2015, Matthew Rhett Jeppson was nominated by President Barack Obama to become the Mint's 39th director and was given the temporary title of principal deputy director. However, the nomination was never confirmed by the Senate. Jeppson stepped down as principal deputy director in January 2017, then replaced by acting principal deputy director David Motl.

56,30,"[""λίθος (líthos) 'stone') is a chemical element; it has symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. "", ""Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is silvery-white. In air it oxidizes to lithium oxide. Its melting point of 180.50 °C (453.65 K; 356.90 °F) and its boiling point of 1,342 °C (1,615 K; 2,448 °F) are each the highest of all the alkali metals while its density of 0.534 g/cm3 is the lowest. Lithium has a very low density (0.534 g/cm3), comparable with pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is more than 60% denser. Apart from helium and hydrogen, as a solid it is less dense than any other element as a liquid, being only two-thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium. Lithium floating in oil Lithium's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures. Lithium has a mass specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin, the highest of all solids. Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications. Isotopes Main article: Isotopes of lithium Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (95.15% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than hydrogen-1, deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s. The 6Li isotope is one of only five stable nuclides to have both an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons, the other four stable odd-odd nuclides being hydrogen-2, boron-10, nitrogen-14, and tantalum-180m.

Lepidolite and spodumene are other common minerals which contain lithium. Commercial quantities of these three minerals are found in a special igneous rock deposit that geologists call pegmatite. In pegmatites, magma cools so slowly that crystals have time to grow very large. Because lepidolite is a type of mica, its crystals grow into long thin sheets.

Lithium batteries are proving to be an effective and affordable alternative to traditional batteries, and also used in new battery applications.  More than 80% of lithium mined is used in batteries.  This use has recently increased rapidly spurring an increase in lithium mining to provide the lithium for batteries. Lithium is mixed with other light metals such as aluminum and magnesium to form strong, light-weight alloys (an alloy is a mixture of metals).

57,16,"[""The Job Safety Law of 1970: Its Passage Was Perilous Three decades ago Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to help protect the Nation's workers on the job, following a 3-year struggle. By Judson MacLaury On December 29, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed into law the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act, which gave the Federal Government the authority to set and enforce safety and health standards for most of the country's workers.1 This act was the result of a hard fought legislative battle which began in 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson unsuccessfully sought a similar measure. However, the roots of government regulation of workplace hazards date back to the late 19th century. State Factory Laws "", ""The labyrinth of State job safety and health legislation covered a wide range of workplace hazards but was badly flawed. There were too many holes in the piecemeal system and numerous hazards were left uncontrolled. The laws had to be amended often to cover new hazards. Many legislatures failed to provide adequate funds for enforcement. Inspectors, who were often political appointees, were not always given the legal right to enter workplaces. State with strong safety and health laws tended to lose industry to those with less stringent ones, which made States competitive and limited their legislative efforts. The Progressive Era and the growth of mass circulation newspapers and national magazines helped forge a national movement for workers' safety and health. In 1907, 362 coal miners were killed at Monongah, W. Va., in the worst U.S. mine disaster. This widely publicized tragedy shocked the Nation and led to the creation in 1910 of the U.S. Bureau of Mines to promote mine safety. That same year William B. Hard, a muckraking journalist, published an article in Everybody's Magazine titled, 'Making Steel and Killing Men,' based on his firsthand investigations of a Chicago mill.3 Hard estimated that every year, out of a work force of 10,000 workers, 1,200 were killed or seriously injured. He urged the steel industry to use its technical knowledge to reduce this casualty rate. U.S. Steel, spurred by mounting accident tolls, had already begun to collect accident statistics. Safety programs in subsidiaries dated back to the 1890's. In 1908, U.S. Steel formed a safety committee with instructions from the company president, Judge Elbert Gary, to cut the accident rate as much as possible. A highly successful 'safety first' movement developed from this which spilled over to other industries and led to the creation of the National Safety Council in 1915.4 "", ""Years before the Pittsburgh Survey, the idea of compensating injured workers from an insurance fund to which employers would contribute had gained a foothold in this country, though it was not at first promoted as a preventive measure. Prince Otto von Bismarck had initiated the first workers' compensation program in Germany in 1884, and the idea soon spread throughout Europe. In the United States, a few States tried to establish early compensation systems. Organized labor successfully opposed the concept, precisely because it was intended as a palliative, not a preventive measure. In 1908, Congress passed, with President Theodore Roosevelt's support, a limited workers' compensation law for Federal employees. Encouraged by this example, several States appointed study commissions. However, until the Pittsburgh Survey, compensation was treated mainly as a humanitarian measure. "", ""The Federal Government was relatively inactive, though not dormant, on safety and health until the era of workers' compensation. In 1790, the First Congress passed an ineffective merchant seaman's act which gave the crew of a ship at sea the right to order the vessel into the nearest port if a majority of the seamen plus the first mate believed it was unseaworthy.9 In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission partly because of the large numbers of railroad workers killed or injured in train wrecks. In 1893, at the urging of the commission and the railroad unions, Congress passed the 'coupler bill' which banned the notoriously dangerous link-and-pin method of coupling cars. "", ""Congress enacted three laws as part of Roosevelt's New Deal which augmented the Federal Government's role in protecting people on the job. The Social Security Act of 1935 allowed the U.S. Public Health Service to fund industrial health programs run by State health departments. This made the Public Health Service, which had begun doing industrial health studies in 1914, the national leader in this field. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which set a minimum wage and banned exploitative child labor, gave the Labor Department the power to bar workers under age 18 from dangerous occupations.

By Judson MacLaury On December 29, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed into law the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act, which gave the Federal Government the authority to set and enforce safety and health standards for most of the country's workers.1 This act was the result of a hard fought legislative battle which began in 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson unsuccessfully sought a similar measure. However, the roots of government regulation of workplace hazards date back to the late 19th century. State Factory Laws "", ""https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/osha\nThe labyrinth of State job safety and health legislation covered a wide range of workplace hazards but was badly flawed. There were too many holes in the piecemeal system and numerous hazards were left uncontrolled. The laws had to be amended often to cover new hazards. Many legislatures failed to provide adequate funds for enforcement. Inspectors, who were often political appointees, were not always given the legal right to enter workplaces. State with strong safety and health laws tended to lose industry to those with less stringent ones, which made States competitive and limited their legislative efforts. The Progressive Era and the growth of mass circulation newspapers and national magazines helped forge a national movement for workers' safety and health. In 1907, 362 coal miners were killed at Monongah, W. Va., in the worst U.S. mine disaster. This widely publicized tragedy shocked the Nation and led to the creation in 1910 of the U.S. Bureau of Mines to promote mine safety. That same year William B. Hard, a muckraking journalist, published an article in Everybody's Magazine titled, 'Making Steel and Killing Men,' based on his firsthand investigations of a Chicago mill.3 Hard estimated that every year, out of a work force of 10,000 workers, 1,200 were killed or seriously injured. He urged the steel industry to use its technical knowledge to reduce this casualty rate. U.S. Steel, spurred by mounting accident tolls, had already begun to collect accident statistics. Safety programs in subsidiaries dated back to the 1890's. In 1908, U.S. Steel formed a safety committee with instructions from the company president, Judge Elbert Gary, to cut the accident rate as much as possible. A highly successful 'safety first' movement developed from this which spilled over to other industries and led to the creation of the National Safety Council in 1915.4 "", ""https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/osha\nYears before the Pittsburgh Survey, the idea of compensating injured workers from an insurance fund to which employers would contribute had gained a foothold in this country, though it was not at first promoted as a preventive measure. Prince Otto von Bismarck had initiated the first workers' compensation program in Germany in 1884, and the idea soon spread throughout Europe. In the United States, a few States tried to establish early compensation systems. Organized labor successfully opposed the concept, precisely because it was intended as a palliative, not a preventive measure. In 1908, Congress passed, with President Theodore Roosevelt's support, a limited workers' compensation law for Federal employees. Encouraged by this example, several States appointed study commissions. However, until the Pittsburgh Survey, compensation was treated mainly as a humanitarian measure. "", ""https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/osha\nThe Federal Government was relatively inactive, though not dormant, on safety and health until the era of workers' compensation. In 1790, the First Congress passed an ineffective merchant seaman's act which gave the crew of a ship at sea the right to order the vessel into the nearest port if a majority of the seamen plus the first mate believed it was unseaworthy.9 In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission partly because of the large numbers of railroad workers killed or injured in train wrecks. In 1893, at the urging of the commission and the railroad unions, Congress passed the 'coupler bill' which banned the notoriously dangerous link-and-pin method of coupling cars. "", ""https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/osha\nCongress enacted three laws as part of Roosevelt's New Deal which augmented the Federal Government's role in protecting people on the job. The Social Security Act of 1935 allowed the U.S. Public Health Service to fund industrial health programs run by State health departments. This made the Public Health Service, which had begun doing industrial health studies in 1914, the national leader in this field. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which set a minimum wage and banned exploitative child labor, gave the Labor Department the power to bar workers under age 18 from dangerous occupations. The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936 allowed the department to ban contract work done under hazardous conditions.

Over the next five years, High Trees paid the reduced rate while the flats began to fill, and by 1945, the flats were back at full occupancy. Central London sued for payment of the full rental costs from June 1945 onward (i.e. for last two quarters of 1945). it was held by Denning J that; 'a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on'. Hence, central London property trust ltd will be estopped from claiming the full rent from 1940. since it made a promise to collect half price of the rent and the defendant believing so acted on the promise. "", 'High Trees House Ltd leased a block of flats in Battersea, London from Central London Property Trust Ltd. The agreement was made in 1937 and specified an annual ground rent of £2,500. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 led to a downturn in the rental market. High Trees struggled to find tenants for the property and approached Central London Property Trust in January 1940 to request that the rent be lowered. A reduction to £1,250 per year was agreed in writing, though the duration was not specified and no consideration was provided. By 1945, the building was returning to full occupancy. On 21 September 1945, Central London Property wrote to High Trees to request a return to the full rent of £2,500 and claiming arrears of £7,916 for the period since 1940. They then brought a test action to recover part of the debt for the two quarters which had elapsed since June 1945. Judgment Based on previous judgments as Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co, Denning J held that the full rent was payable from the time that the flats became fully occupied in mid-1945. However, he continued in an obiter statement that if Central London had tried to claim for the full rent from 1940 onwards, they would not have been able to. This was reasoned on the basis that if a party leads another party to believe that he will not enforce his strict legal rights, then the courts will prevent him from doing so at a later stage. Being obiter dicta and in a court of first instance this was doubly not a binding precedent, yet it essentially created the doctrine of promissory estoppel. ', 'The claimant let by deed a block a flats to the defendant for a term of 99 years in 1937. The rent was £2,500 a year. The subsequent chaos of WW2 meant that the defendant could only sublease some of the flats to tenants. This put them in danger of defaulting on the rent. The claimant told the defendant that they would reduce the rent to £1,250 a year to avoid this. In 1945, the claimant wrote to the defendant stating that rent would now be payable at the original rate. They also asked for back-payments covering the difference during the war period. The parties sought a declaration from the court as to what the defendant’s legal position was. Issue(s) Could the claimant insist on the defendant paying the full rent?Was the claimant entitled to back-payments? Decision ', ""By a lease under seal made on September 24, 1937, the plaintiffs, Central London Property Trust Ld., granted to the defendants, High Trees House Ld., a subsidiary of the plaintiff company, a tenancy of a block of flats for the term of ninety-nine years from September 29, 1937, at a ground rent of 2,500l. a year. The block of flats was a new one and had not been fully occupied at the beginning of the war owing to the absence of people from London. With war conditions prevailing, it was apparent to those responsible that the rent reserved under the lease could not be paid out of the profits of the flats and, accordingly, discussions took place between the directors of the two companies concerned, which were closely associated, and an arrangement was made between them which was put into writing. On January 3, 1940, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants in these terms, 'we confirm the arrangement made between us by which the ground rent should be reduced as from the commencement of the lease to 1,250l. per annum,' and on April 2, 1940, a confirmatory resolution to the same effect was passed by the plaintiff company.

"", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London_Property_Trust_Ltd_v_High_Trees_House_Ltd\nHigh Trees House Ltd leased a block of flats in Battersea, London from Central London Property Trust Ltd. The agreement was made in 1937 and specified an annual ground rent of £2,500. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 led to a downturn in the rental market. High Trees struggled to find tenants for the property and approached Central London Property Trust in January 1940 to request that the rent be lowered. A reduction to £1,250 per year was agreed in writing, though the duration was not specified and no consideration was provided. By 1945, the building was returning to full occupancy. On 21 September 1945, Central London Property wrote to High Trees to request a return to the full rent of £2,500 and claiming arrears of £7,916 for the period since 1940. They then brought a test action to recover part of the debt for the two quarters which had elapsed since June 1945. Judgment Based on previous judgments as Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co, Denning J held that the full rent was payable from the time that the flats became fully occupied in mid-1945. However, he continued in an obiter statement that if Central London had tried to claim for the full rent from 1940 onwards, they would not have been able to. This was reasoned on the basis that if a party leads another party to believe that he will not enforce his strict legal rights, then the courts will prevent him from doing so at a later stage. Being obiter dicta and in a court of first instance this was doubly not a binding precedent, yet it essentially created the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

The claimant told the defendant that they would reduce the rent to £1,250 a year to avoid this. In 1945, the claimant wrote to the defendant stating that rent would now be payable at the original rate. They also asked for back-payments covering the difference during the war period.

The block of flats was a new one and had not been fully occupied at the beginning of the war owing to the absence of people from London. With war conditions prevailing, it was apparent to those responsible that the rent reserved under the lease could not be paid out of the profits of the flats and, accordingly, discussions took place between the directors of the two companies concerned, which were closely associated, and an arrangement was made between them which was put into writing. On January 3, 1940, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants in these terms, 'we confirm the arrangement made between us by which the ground rent should be reduced as from the commencement of the lease to 1,250l. per annum,' and on April 2, 1940, a confirmatory resolution to the same effect was passed by the plaintiff company.

59,30,"[""λίθος (líthos) 'stone') is a chemical element; it has symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. "", ""Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is silvery-white. In air it oxidizes to lithium oxide. Its melting point of 180.50 °C (453.65 K; 356.90 °F) and its boiling point of 1,342 °C (1,615 K; 2,448 °F) are each the highest of all the alkali metals while its density of 0.534 g/cm3 is the lowest. Lithium has a very low density (0.534 g/cm3), comparable with pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is more than 60% denser. Apart from helium and hydrogen, as a solid it is less dense than any other element as a liquid, being only two-thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium. Lithium floating in oil Lithium's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures. Lithium has a mass specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin, the highest of all solids. Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications. Isotopes Main article: Isotopes of lithium Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (95.15% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than hydrogen-1, deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s. The 6Li isotope is one of only five stable nuclides to have both an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons, the other four stable odd-odd nuclides being hydrogen-2, boron-10, nitrogen-14, and tantalum-180m.

Lepidolite and spodumene are other common minerals which contain lithium. Commercial quantities of these three minerals are found in a special igneous rock deposit that geologists call pegmatite. In pegmatites, magma cools so slowly that crystals have time to grow very large. Because lepidolite is a type of mica, its crystals grow into long thin sheets.

60,29,"[""'Joy to the World' is a song written by Hoyt Axton and made famous by the band Three Dog Night. The song is also popularly known by its opening lyric, 'Jeremiah was a bullfrog'. Three Dog Night originally released the song on their fourth studio album, Naturally, in November 1970, and subsequently released an edited version of the song as a single in February 1971. The song, which has been described by members of Three Dog Night as a 'kid's song' and a 'silly song', topped the singles charts in North America, was certified gold by the RIAA, and has since been covered by multiple artists. Background and recording Some of the words are nonsensical. Axton wanted to persuade his record producers to record a new melody he had written, and the producers asked him to sing any words to the tune. A member of Three Dog Night said that the original lyrics to the song were 'Jeremiah was a prophet' but no one liked it.

"", ""The only song that appears in both The Big Chill (1983) and Forrest Gump (1994) is Three Dog Night’s exuberant 'Joy to the World,' whose delirious mash-up of Biblical allusions, anti-war rhetoric and free-love bawdiness made it a kind of consensus hit in culturally polarized times: in terms of sales and airplay, it was the biggest song of 1971. Where Three Dog Night was a pure El Lay band, 'Joy to the World' was written by an Oklahoman, Hoyt Axton, whose mother Mae actually co-wrote 'Heartbreak Hotel' for Elvis Presley—a coincidence that recalls the (obviously speculative) scene in Forrest Gump where the King is shown honing his craft in an Alabama boarding-house room. 'Joy to the World'’s appearance in Gump is relatively unimportant: it plays behind scenes of the hero practicing ping-pong diplomacy in front of an enormous mural of Chairman Mao—a bit of classic-rock patriotism. But its use as an overture in The Big Chill—sung hoarsely at bath time by a young child right before his Dad gets some bad news via telephone—is suggestive: the sound of a cozy, insular bubble bursting.

His words help us see our sin and help us confess that sin. Then, when we have done so, we should help him drink his wine singing joy to the world rather than wallow in self-pity. For there’s joy in the release from sin that Jesus provides. Not release just from guilt and wallowing in self-pity. Release from the fact that sin can define us at all. Sin is not how God sees us. God sees us as a reflection of himself, images of God. God sees us as beloved children, brothers and sisters of his own Son Jesus Christ. God sees us and says, in the words of Psalm 139, that we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made.' Jesus provides for that. One of the big things that happened on the cross was this: sin no longer defines who we are in God’s eyes.

In their seminal work on federal jurisdiction, Felix Frankfurter and Wilber Katz allude to a 'dynamic struggle' between federal and state power, the ebb and flow of competing, sometimes conflicting, spheres of federal and state power and influence. In many respects, the story of American government is the story of how that struggle has been resolved. The antecedents of American federalism trace to colonial days, when the concept of divided sovereign power began to take shape. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies declared themselves to be free and independent states. During the hostilities and at the War’s end, the newly formed states recognized that they needed to operate together to function adequately on the new national stage and to enter the world stage. "", 'In their Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay promoted state ratification of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 9, Hamilton attempted to assuage the concerns that the states would lose sovereignty under the new Constitution: So long as the separate organization of the members be not abolished . . . though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty . . . and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power.25 In Federalist No. 51, Hamilton argued that federalism would help limit the ability of the proposed new central government to abuse its powers: ', ""and eight years after ratification of the Articles of Confederation, which established a league of sovereign states, the nation repealed the Articles of Confederation and ratified a new Constitution creating the United States. Since its ratification the Constitution, which established a union of states under a federal system of governance, two questions have generated considerable debate: What is the nature of the union? What powers, privileges, duties, and responsibilities does the Constitution grant to the national government and reserve to the states and to the people? During the 208-year history of the Constitution the answers to these questions have been debated time and again and have shaped and been shaped by the nation's political, social and economic history. What is federalism? According to James Q. Wilson and John DiIulio, Jr., it is a system of government 'in which sovereignty is shared [between two or more levels of government] so that on some matters the national government is supreme and on others the states, regions, or provincial governments are supreme.1 There are three essential features that characterize a federal system of governance. First, there must be a provision for more than one level of government to act simultaneously on the same territory and on the same citizens. The American federal system is composed of a national government and the 50 states, both recognized by the Constitution. Local governments, creations of states, while not mentioned in the Constitution, are nevertheless key players in American federalism.

Two important aspects of the U.S. Constitution—federalism and the separation of powers—represent, in part, the framers’ efforts to divide governmental power.

Local governments, while not recognized in the Constitution, are used by states in conducting the activities of government. Under the traditional system of 'dual federalism,' which lasted from 1789 to 1937, there was a relatively clear division of federal power, with the national government limiting itself primarily to promoting commerce (buttressed by cases such as McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden), while the states did most of the governing. "", ""Faced with the very real problems of a weak central government, Congress issued a resolution in February 1787 calling for a convention to amend the Articles of Confederation.  But at the Philadelphia convention, which opened on May 25, 1787, delegates quickly began to consider an entirely new form of government, federalism, which shared power between the states and a more robust central government with truly national powers.After four months, the delegates drastically changed the relationship among the states and created a new national government, abandoning the Articles of Confederation.  This new government had executive and judicial powers, along with expanded legislative authority.  Unlike the Confederation, states in the new legislature would not be represented equally.  Instead, big states with large populations exercised more power in Congress.  Slaveholding states were allowed to count three-fifths of their enslaved population for representation and taxation purposes.  To count slaves fully would only have increased the political power of slave states.On September 17, 1787, the delegates approved and signed an entirely new Constitution for the United States of America.  Once approved by the people, the Constitution's federal system would create a unique solution to sharing power among the states and the national government.

The delegates who gathered in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787, first to revise the existing form of government and then to frame a new Constitution, debated the idea of a Congress made up of two houses. One house would be, in the words of Virginia’s George Mason, the 'grand depository of the democratic principle of government.' To counter this popular influence in the national government, James Madison of Virginia proposed another house that would be small, deliberative, and independent from the larger, more democratic house. This became the Senate. "", 'Federalism can be found in a number of areas in the US Constitution. It is perhaps most clear through the use of enumerated powers, clearly allocating responsibilities to the Federal Government and responsibilities to the State Governments. In addition to this, it is also shown through the concurrent and implied powers. Finally there are two significant parts of the Constitution that show federalism, namely the ‘Elastic Clause’ which allows Congress to make all laws that are necessary and proper, and the 10th amendment which guarantees states rights.

One house would be, in the words of Virginia’s George Mason, the 'grand depository of the democratic principle of government.' To counter this popular influence in the national government, James Madison of Virginia proposed another house that would be small, deliberative, and independent from the larger, more democratic house. This became the Senate.

It is spongy, about six to ten inches long, and is shaped like a flat pear or a fish extended horizontally across the abdomen. The wide part, called the head of the pancreas, is positioned toward the center of the abdomen. The head of the pancreas is located at the juncture where the stomach meets the first part of the small intestine. This is where the stomach empties partially digested food into the intestine, and the pancreas releases digestive enzymes into these contents. The central section of the pancreas is called the neck or body. The thin end is called the tail and extends to the left side. Several major blood vessels surround the pancreas, the superior mesenteric artery, the superior mesenteric vein, the portal vein and the celiac axis, supplying blood to the pancreas and other abdominal organs. ', ""In vertebrates, the gallbladder, also known as the cholecyst, is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine. In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and stores it. The bile is then released via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats. The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved – usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder (called a cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease. Structure The gallbladder is a hollow grey-blue organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the liver. In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 inches) in length and 4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter when fully distended. The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres (1.8 imperial fluid ounces). The gallbladder is shaped like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct. The gallbladder is divided into three sections: the fundus, body, and neck. The fundus is the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree. The gallbladder fossa, against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V. The cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct. At the junction of the neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct, there is an out-pouching of the gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as 'Hartmann's pouch'. "", 'The gallbladder develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. Early in development, the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. During the second week of embryogenesis, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract.

66,29,"[""'Joy to the World' is a song written by Hoyt Axton and made famous by the band Three Dog Night. The song is also popularly known by its opening lyric, 'Jeremiah was a bullfrog'. Three Dog Night originally released the song on their fourth studio album, Naturally, in November 1970, and subsequently released an edited version of the song as a single in February 1971. The song, which has been described by members of Three Dog Night as a 'kid's song' and a 'silly song', topped the singles charts in North America, was certified gold by the RIAA, and has since been covered by multiple artists. Background and recording Some of the words are nonsensical. Axton wanted to persuade his record producers to record a new melody he had written, and the producers asked him to sing any words to the tune. A member of Three Dog Night said that the original lyrics to the song were 'Jeremiah was a prophet' but no one liked it. "", ""December 2015  (18) November 2015  (19) October 2015  (19) September 2015  (4) A Six-Pack of Three Dog Night Written by Jim S. I’ve always liked Three Dog Night but entirely as a band I hear on the radio. Prior to doing this post, I couldn’t name one single album of theirs nor was I 100% certain I could name six tunes I dug. But I could and did. I will overlook 'Joy to the World' which is probably fun to sing at a wedding reception especially if you’re totally fucked-up. First, as always, a little history. I’m relying on Wikipedia and whatever else I can find because their website bio is less history and more 'ain’t we swell’ puff piece. Three Dog Night is an American rock band formed in 1967, with founding members consisting of vocalists Danny Hutton, Cory Wells, and Chuck Negron. This lineup was soon augmented by Jimmy Greenspoon (keyboards), Joe Schermie (bass), Michael Allsup (guitar), and Floyd Sneed (drums). "", ""The only song that appears in both The Big Chill (1983) and Forrest Gump (1994) is Three Dog Night’s exuberant 'Joy to the World,' whose delirious mash-up of Biblical allusions, anti-war rhetoric and free-love bawdiness made it a kind of consensus hit in culturally polarized times: in terms of sales and airplay, it was the biggest song of 1971. Where Three Dog Night was a pure El Lay band, 'Joy to the World' was written by an Oklahoman, Hoyt Axton, whose mother Mae actually co-wrote 'Heartbreak Hotel' for Elvis Presley—a coincidence that recalls the (obviously speculative) scene in Forrest Gump where the King is shown honing his craft in an Alabama boarding-house room. 'Joy to the World'’s appearance in Gump is relatively unimportant: it plays behind scenes of the hero practicing ping-pong diplomacy in front of an enormous mural of Chairman Mao—a bit of classic-rock patriotism. But its use as an overture in The Big Chill—sung hoarsely at bath time by a young child right before his Dad gets some bad news via telephone—is suggestive: the sound of a cozy, insular bubble bursting.

The three first came together in 1967 to create some recordings with Brian Wilson.  In those days they went under the name of Redwood. In 1968, the vocalists looked around for some musicians of their own and Three Dog Night was formed. The name Three Dog Night was suggested by the girlfriend of vocalist Danny Hutton.  She had read a magazine article about indigenous Australians.  It explained that on cold nights they would sleep in a hole in the ground while embracing a dingo (a native species of wild dog). On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs and if the night were freezing, it was a 'three dog night.'

His words help us see our sin and help us confess that sin. Then, when we have done so, we should help him drink his wine singing joy to the world rather than wallow in self-pity. For there’s joy in the release from sin that Jesus provides. Not release just from guilt and wallowing in self-pity. Release from the fact that sin can define us at all. Sin is not how God sees us. God sees us as a reflection of himself, images of God. God sees us as beloved children, brothers and sisters of his own Son Jesus Christ. God sees us and says, in the words of Psalm 139, that we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made.' Jesus provides for that. One of the big things that happened on the cross was this: sin no longer defines who we are in God’s eyes.

I’ve always liked Three Dog Night but entirely as a band I hear on the radio. Prior to doing this post, I couldn’t name one single album of theirs nor was I 100% certain I could name six tunes I dug. But I could and did. I will overlook 'Joy to the World' which is probably fun to sing at a wedding reception especially if you’re totally fucked-up. First, as always, a little history. I’m relying on Wikipedia and whatever else I can find because their website bio is less history and more 'ain’t we swell’ puff piece. Three Dog Night is an American rock band formed in 1967, with founding members consisting of vocalists Danny Hutton, Cory Wells, and Chuck Negron.

Released in 1971, Joy to the World sold five million copies. three dog night fax Three Dog Night is an American band primarily featuring the talents of three vocalists: Danny Hutton, Cory Wells and Chuck Negron.  The three first came together in 1967 to create some recordings with Brian Wilson.  In those days they went under the name of Redwood. In 1968, the vocalists looked around for some musicians of their own and Three Dog Night was formed. The name Three Dog Night was suggested by the girlfriend of vocalist Danny Hutton.  She had read a magazine article about indigenous Australians.  It explained that on cold nights they would sleep in a hole in the ground while embracing a dingo (a native species of wild dog). On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs and if the night were freezing, it was a 'three dog night.' Between 1969 and 1975, Three Dog Night scored 21 Billboard Top 40 hits, including three #1’s. The band introduced the world to many artists and songwriters by recording the works of people such as: Paul Williams, Hoyt Axton, Laura Nyro, Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, and Leo Sayer. The band is still together and recording.  They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000. joy to the world fax Joy to the World is one of the best-selling singles in history. Joy to the World was written by Hoyt Axton who also wrote Heartbreak Hotel, Elvis’ first #1 hit. "", ""https://tedgoshorn.org/2022/10/30/jeremiah-was-a-bullfrog-or-a-prophet/\nThree Dog Night got it right. We should befriend Jeremiah. His words help us see our sin and help us confess that sin. Then, when we have done so, we should help him drink his wine singing joy to the world rather than wallow in self-pity. For there’s joy in the release from sin that Jesus provides. Not release just from guilt and wallowing in self-pity. Release from the fact that sin can define us at all. Sin is not how God sees us. God sees us as a reflection of himself, images of God. God sees us as beloved children, brothers and sisters of his own Son Jesus Christ. God sees us and says, in the words of Psalm 139, that we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made.' Jesus provides for that. One of the big things that happened on the cross was this: sin no longer defines who we are in God’s eyes. God looks at us and says, just as he did to the woman at the well, 'Go, and sin no more…I forgive your iniquity and remember your sins no more.'

Boasting chart and sales records that remain virtually unmatched in popular music, THREE DOG NIGHT had 21 consecutive Top 40 hits, including 3 #1 singles, 11 Top 10’s, 18 straight Top 20’s, 7 million-selling singles and 12 straight RIAA Certified Gold LPs. The hits appeared on best selling charts in all genres (pop, rock and country). Its records continue to sell around the world, reaching beyond the borders of the U.S. into Japan, Canada, Holland, England, Germany, Spain and elsewhere. Tens of millions of THREE DOG NIGHT records have been sold through the years. Created in 1968 by Danny Hutton, THREE DOG NIGHT maintains an aggressive, year- round touring schedule of over 90 dates a year, performing their hit filled concerts for multi-generational audiences. The band’s now-famous name refers to native Australian hunters in the outback who huddled with their dogs for warmth on cold nights; the coldest being a 'three dog night'. The band recorded songs of the best and largely undiscovered new songwriters of its time including Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, Elton John, Laura Nyro, Paul Williams and Hoyt Axton among many others. The group’s eclectic taste, combined with its ability to recognize and record hits in a unique, distinctive, and appealing style, resulted in THREE DOG NIGHT dominating the charts for years. The band’s music transcends time, bringing together both new and longtime audiences alike. THREE DOG NIGHT demonstrates its eclectic song choices once again with the new material being recorded for an upcoming album release. One of the new tracks, 'Prayer of the Children' was discovered by Hutton who created an a cappella arrangement, so Three Dog Night Page 1 that for the first time in the history of THREE DOG NIGHT, the vocals of all six members of the band are featured.

67,25,"[""Diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian, and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale. Eyes vary in their visual acuity, the range of wavelengths they can detect, their sensitivity in no light, their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects, and whether they can discriminate colours. History of research The human eye, showing the iris and pupil In 1802, philosopher William Paley called it a miracle of 'design.' In 1859, Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species, that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance 'absurd in the highest possible degree'. However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible: "", ""Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors. Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classic paper that only a few hundred thousand generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates. Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through. All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory. Rate of evolution The first possible fossils of eyes found to date are from the Ediacaran period (about 555 million years ago), while the oldest certain fossilized eye is from a Schmidtiellus reetae fossil from 530 mya, collected in Saviranna in northern Estonia. The structure is similar to the compound eyes of modern-day dragonflies and bees, but with (~100) ommatidia spaced further apart, and without a lens. The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the 'Cambrian explosion'. One of the many hypotheses for 'causes' of the Cambrian explosion is the 'Light Switch' theory of Andrew Parker: it holds that the evolution of advanced eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution. Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision. The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate because the fossil record, particularly of the lower Cambrian, is poor. How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells can evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation, relative advantage to the organism, and natural selection. However, the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year, which is common in small animals. Even with these pessimistic values, the vertebrate eye could still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years.[note 1] Origins of the eye Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye. All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development. This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light-sensitive machinery – even if it was not a dedicated optical organ. However, even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells. Probably, photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion. Higher-level similarities – such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses – reflect the co-option of a more fundamental protein to a new function within the eye. A shared trait common to all light-sensitive organs are opsins. Opsins belong to a family of photo-sensitive proteins and fall into nine groups, which already existed in the urbilaterian, the last common ancestor of all bilaterally symmetrical animals. Additionally, the genetic toolkit for positioning eyes is shared by all animals: The PAX6 gene controls where eyes develop in animals ranging from octopuses to mice and fruit flies. Such high-level genes are, by implication, much older than many of the structures that they control today; they must originally have served a different purpose, before they were co-opted for eye development. Eyes and other sensory organs probably evolved before the brain: There is no need for an information-processing organ (brain) before there is information to process. A living example are cubozoan jellyfish that possess eyes comparable to vertebrate and cephalopod camera eyes despite lacking a brain. Stages of evolution "", ""Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation. Vision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes. However, how this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism's environment varies widely: eyes have a wide range of structures and forms, all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules. At a cellular level, there appear to be two main types of eyes, one possessed by the protostomes (molluscs, annelid worms and arthropods), the other by the deuterostomes (chordates and echinoderms). "", ""The basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules bound to each other and located in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein; and a chromophore, the pigment that absorbs light. Groups of such cells are termed 'eyespots', and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings. Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species. The planarian has 'cup' eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction. These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup, which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions, then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened. While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light, as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo-sensitive cells regardless of its direction, the 'cup' shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light's angle. Pit eyes, which had arisen by the Cambrian period, were seen in ancient snails,[clarification needed] and are found in some snails and other invertebrates living today, such as planaria. Planaria can slightly differentiate the direction and intensity of light because of their cup-shaped, heavily pigmented retina cells, which shield the light-sensitive cells from exposure in all directions except for the single opening for the light. However, this proto-eye is still much more useful for detecting the absence or presence of light than its direction; this gradually changes as the eye's pit deepens and the number of photoreceptive cells grows, allowing for increasingly precise visual information. When a photon is absorbed by the chromophore, a chemical reaction causes the photon's energy to be transduced into electrical energy and relayed, in higher animals, to the nervous system. These photoreceptor cells form part of the retina, a thin layer of cells that relays visual information, including the light and day-length information needed by the circadian rhythm system, to the brain. However, some jellyfish, such as Cladonema (Cladonematidae), have elaborate eyes but no brain. Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain. During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction. The nautilus eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera.

Planaria can slightly differentiate the direction and intensity of light because of their cup-shaped, heavily pigmented retina cells, which shield the light-sensitive cells from exposure in all directions except for the single opening for the light. However, this proto-eye is still much more useful for detecting the absence or presence of light than its direction; this gradually changes as the eye's pit deepens and the number of photoreceptive cells grows, allowing for increasingly precise visual information. When a photon is absorbed by the chromophore, a chemical reaction causes the photon's energy to be transduced into electrical energy and relayed, in higher animals, to the nervous system. These photoreceptor cells form part of the retina, a thin layer of cells that relays visual information, including the light and day-length information needed by the circadian rhythm system, to the brain. However, some jellyfish, such as Cladonema (Cladonematidae), have elaborate eyes but no brain. Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain. During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction. The nautilus eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera. ""]","[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye\n\x1b[1;31;60m[1] The basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules bound to each other and located in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein; and a chromophore, the pigment that absorbs light\x1b[0m. \x1b[1;31;60m[2] Groups of such cells are termed 'eyespots', and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times\x1b[0m. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings. Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species. The planarian has 'cup' eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction. These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup, which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions, then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened. While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light, as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo-sensitive cells regardless of its direction, the 'cup' shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light's angle.

The reaction occurs when the red blood cells that were given during the transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system. When red blood cells are destroyed, the process is called hemolysis.There are other types of transfusion reactions that do not cause hemolysis, such as febrile (causing fever) transfusion reactions.Causes "", 'Transfusion of ABO major-incompatible red blood cells (RBCs) can activate the complement system and can cause severe and even lethal acute hemolytic reactions. The activation of the complement system with formation of C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins) and the release of hemoglobin from the lysed RBCs are thought to mediate clinical signs like fever, hypotension, pain, and acute renal failure. Therapeutic inhibition of the complement cascade in case of ABO-incompatible RBC transfusion would be desirable to ameliorate the signs and symptoms and to improve the outcome of the reaction. Study design and methods: A patient with blood group B was erroneously transfused with a unit of group A2 RBCs. Within 1 hour after transfusion she received eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the complement component C5 and blocks its cleavage. Clinical and immunohematologic observations are reported here. Results: ', ""RBC transfusions are used to treat hemorrhage and to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Transfusion of RBCs should be based on the patient's clinical condition.4 Indications for RBC transfusion include acute sickle cell crisis (for stroke prevention), or acute blood loss of greater than 1,500 mL or 30 percent of blood volume.4 Patients with symptomatic anemia should be transfused if they cannot function without treating the anemia.4 Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, reduced exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, changes in mental status, muscle cramps, and angina or severe congestive heart failure. The 10/30 rule—transfusion when a patient has a hemoglobin level less than or equal to 10 g per dL (100 g per L) and a hematocrit level less than or equal to 30 percent—was used until the 1980s as the trigger to transfuse, regardless of the patient's clinical presentation.4,5 "", ""Hemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by immune destruction of transfused RBCs, which are attacked by the recipient's antibodies. The antibodies to the antigens of the ABO blood group or alloantibodies to other RBC antigens are produced after immunization through a previous transfusion or pregnancy. There are two categories of hemolytic transfusion reactions: acute and delayed. Nonimmune causes of acute reactions include bacterial overgrowth, improper storing, infusion with incompatible medications, and infusion of blood through lines containing hypotonic solutions or small-bore intravenous tubes.16,18,19 In acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, there is a destruction of the donor's RBCs within 24 hours of transfusion. Hemolysis may be intravascular or extravascular. The most common type is extravascular hemolysis, which occurs when donor RBCs coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) or complement are attacked in the liver or spleen.17 Intravascular hemolysis is a severe form of hemolysis caused by ABO antibodies. Symptoms of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions include fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, hypotension, diffuse bleeding, hemoglobinuria, oliguria, anuria, pain at the infusion site; and chest, back, and abdominal pain.19 Associated complications are clinically significant anemia, acute or exacerbated renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, need for dialysis, and death secondary to complications.18 The incidence of acute hemolytic reactions is approximately one to five per 50,000 transfusions.19 From 1996 to 2007, there were 213 ABO-incompatible RBC transfusions with 24 deaths.17 Systems using bar codes for blood and patient identification have decreased errors.17 ALLERGIC REACTIONS Allergic reactions range from mild (urticarial) to life threatening (anaphylactic). Urticarial allergic reactions are defined by hives or pruritus.20 Patients experiencing allergic transfusion reactions have been sensitized to the antigens in the donor unit. These antigens are soluble, and the associated reaction is dose-dependent. Allergic transfusion reactions occur in 1 to 3 percent of transfusions.16 "", 'Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when ABO-incompatible blood is transfused, resulting in recipient antibodies attaching to donor RBC antigens and forming an antigen-antibody complex. This antigen-antibody complex activates complement, resulting in intravascular RBC lysis with release of RBC stroma and free Hb. Immune system activation also results in bradykinin release (leading to hypotension) and mast cell activation (causing serotonin and histamine release). The net result may be shock, renal failure due to Hb precipitation in renal tubules, and DIC. Many signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction appear immediately and include fever, chest pain, anxiety, back pain, and dyspnea. Many are masked by general anesthesia, but clues to the diagnosis include fever, hypotension, hemoglobinuria, unexplained bleeding, or failure of Hct to increase after transfusion. The incidence of fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction in the US is approximately 1 of every 250,000 to 1,000,000 units transfused. Most reactions occur because of administrative errors, with most due to improper identification of the blood unit or patient. The importance of adhering to strict policies of checking blood and matching to the correct patient in the operating room cannot be overemphasized. ', 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are the most common transfusion reactions, occurring in approximately 1% of RBC transfusions and up to 30% of platelet transfusions. They occur when anti-leukocyte antibodies in a recipient react with white blood cells in a transfused blood product. Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, tachycardia, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Approach to treatment involves first stopping the transfusion and excluding an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction or bacterial contamination of the donor unit. Acetaminophen and meperidine may diminish fever and rigors. Once the diagnosis of FNHTR has been made, future reactions may be avoided or diminished by administering leukocyte-reduced blood products, premedicating at-risk patients with acetaminophen and hydrocortisone and administering the transfusion slowly. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) ', 'Cause: Patients may develop antibodies to red cell antigens. Antibodies can occur naturally, or may arise as a consequence of previous transfusion or pregnancy. A delayed haemolytic reaction occurs when a patient develops an antibody directed against an antigen on transfused red cells. The antibody may cause shortened red cell survival, with clinical features of fever, jaundice and lower than expected haemoglobin following transfusion. Most delayed haemolytic reactions produce few symptoms and may go unrecognised, however there are reports of serious consequences in critically ill patients. Prevention: An antibody screen is performed as part of pre-transfusion testing. When an antibody is detected, it is identified and appropriate antigen negative blood is provided. Sometimes antibodies fall below detectable limits and may not be detected by pretransfusion testing. Alloimmunisation Red Blood Cells ', 'A hemolytic reaction happens when the body attacks the donated RBCs. This happens if a person gets a blood type that their blood isn’t compatible with. Donated blood goes through a very careful matching process, so this reaction is very rare. If it does happen, it can cause chills, fever, kidney damage, and other serious symptoms.

It is spongy, about six to ten inches long, and is shaped like a flat pear or a fish extended horizontally across the abdomen. The wide part, called the head of the pancreas, is positioned toward the center of the abdomen. The head of the pancreas is located at the juncture where the stomach meets the first part of the small intestine. This is where the stomach empties partially digested food into the intestine, and the pancreas releases digestive enzymes into these contents. The central section of the pancreas is called the neck or body. The thin end is called the tail and extends to the left side. Several major blood vessels surround the pancreas, the superior mesenteric artery, the superior mesenteric vein, the portal vein and the celiac axis, supplying blood to the pancreas and other abdominal organs. ', ""In vertebrates, the gallbladder, also known as the cholecyst, is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine. In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and stores it. The bile is then released via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats. The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved – usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder (called a cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease. Structure The gallbladder is a hollow grey-blue organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the liver. In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 inches) in length and 4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter when fully distended. The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres (1.8 imperial fluid ounces). The gallbladder is shaped like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct. The gallbladder is divided into three sections: the fundus, body, and neck. The fundus is the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree. The gallbladder fossa, against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V. The cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct. At the junction of the neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct, there is an out-pouching of the gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as 'Hartmann's pouch'. "", 'The gallbladder develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. Early in development, the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. During the second week of embryogenesis, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. ', '15. Pancreas: 16. Accessory pancreatic duct, 17.

The Pancreas and Digestion ', ""The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen (see Image. The Gallbladder and Bile Ducts Laid Open). It measures approximately 7 cm to 10 cm in length and 4 cm in width. Even though the organ is small, it is a common cause of abdominal pain due to gallstones, which often require surgical removal of the organ. Anatomically, the gallbladder is located anteriorly on the undersurface of liver segments IV and V. There are many variants of the anatomy of the biliary system making exact knowledge of these anatomic possibilities crucial when performing gallbladder and biliary surgery. The gallbladder has an inferior peritoneal surface and a superior liver surface. It has no capsule however some authors describe an extension of the liver capsule (Glisson's capsule) covering the exposed surface of the body of the gallbladder. The gallbladder fundus is wide, and as it continues into the main body, it narrows in diameter. The gallbladder body tapers into the infundibulum, which then connects to the neck and cystic duct. At the distal portion of the gallbladder and into the cystic duct are spiral valves of Heister. These valves may be responsible to aide gallbladder emptying with neural and hormonal stimulation.

"", 'on May 30, 2018The gallbladder is a pear-shaped, hollow structure located under the liver and on the right side of the abdomen. Its primary function is to store and concentrate bile, a yellow-brown digestive enzyme produced by the liver. The gallbladder is part of the biliary tract.The gallbladder serves as a reservoir for bile while it’s not being used for digestion. The gallbladder’s absorbent lining concentrates the stored bile. When food enters the small intestine, a hormone called cholecystokinin is released, signaling the gallbladder to contract and secrete bile into the small intestine through the common bile duct.The bile helps the digestive process by breaking up fats. It also drains waste products from the liver into the duodenum, a part of the small intestine. An excess of cholesterol, bilirubin, or bile salts can cause gallstones to form. Gallstones are generally small, hard deposits inside the gallbladder that are formed when stored bile crystallizes.

These signs recommend a speed based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). These signs are turned on and off as needed. These are not speed limits, but police may enforce them through the basic rule law. Variable Speed Limit: Variable speed limit signs are black and white and say, 'speed limit.' These signs change the speed limit based on driving conditions like heavy traffic, poor weather or a slippery road (such as heavy rain, fog, ice or snow). Police may enforce these signs like any other speed limit sign.Variable speed signs, based on specific conditions, work to improve safety and reduce the chance of a collision by: Improving Line of Sight: In poor weather conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, or snow, slower speeds give drivers more time to react to obstacles or hazards that may be difficult to see.

You must obey all pavement markings unless you see a police officer or road worker redirecting traffic. Yellow MarkingsAre used to separate traffic moving in opposite directions (center line) and to mark the left edge of one-way roads and ramps, two-way left turn lanes, and painted medians. Solid yellow lineMarks the left edge of one-way roads and ramps. Broken yellow center lineIndicates a two-way road used for traffic traveling in opposite directions. Passing is allowed for both directions of travel. Double center line consisting of a solid yellow line and broken yellow lineIndicates where passing is allowed. A broken yellow line on your side of the lane indicates you are allowed to pass. A solid yellow line on your side of the lane indicates you are not allowed to pass. ', 'https://www.phoenix.gov/streets/safety-topics/speed-limit\nSpeed limits between 25 and 55 mph may be established on the basis of traffic engineering studies. These studies include roadway conditions, accident records and the prevailing speed of prudent drivers. If an unreasonably low speed is posted, most drivers will ignore the signs, while a few may try to stay within the posted speed limit. This causes real safety concerns because of the difference between faster and slower drivers. Setting unrealistically low speed limits... ... has two adverse effects. They make violators out of reasonable and otherwise law-abiding citizens. Most importantly, police enforcement is diminished, which plays a vital role in controlling the speed limit. Unrealistic speed limits create a difficult situation for the police and the community and citations are not upheld in court. Often the police will not return to the site to reinforce the law.

', ""New Earswick is a model village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire, England, near the River Foss, north of York and south of Haxby. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,812, reducing to 2,737 at the 2011 Census. The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority. History The village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, 'I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities'. The first 28 houses were designed between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new village. The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Hartrigg Oaks Complex The village had contemporaries such as Bournville, Saltaire, Port Sunlight and others. It presented a sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the 19th century, the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree's report of 1901, entitled Poverty: a study of town life. It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and insanitary housing. As a result of the report, Joseph Rowntree's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new 'garden' village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. "", 'Garden Village of New EarswickListenThe ‘garden village’ of New Earswick on the northern side of York influenced housing patterns in England and elsewhere for more than 60 years of the 20th century. It was built for Joseph Rowntree (1835-1925) the Quaker chocolate and cocoa manufacturer whose factory was nearby. Construction began in 1902 the year after the publication by Rowntree’s son, Seebohm Rowntree (1871-1954) of his social survey of York, Poverty: a study of town life. The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall. Many of the houses were built in cul-de-sacs which set an example that was copied by builders all over England in the 1920s and 30s. There are extensive open spaces and many trees. Bricks were made from local clay, and the site of the brickyard, which closed in the 1930s, is now a nature reserve.Enlarge mapShrink mapNavigateYour Location?Garden Village of New Earswick ', ""I have recently being doing some work at New Earswick in York, founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree and designed by the practice of Parker and Unwin. The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 and then over successive periods until the present day. What strikes me about the settlement, is how relevant it is to the needs of today, in creating a lovely place to live, set in a sylvan setting, with ample community facilities for the benefit of all. It is a wonderful place to explore on foot, walking down tree lined avenues free from cars and observing modest crafted homes, set behind manicured low hedges. A somewhat idyllic place to engage the fusion of day to day living and nature. It is important to understand the place of New Earswick within the wider Garden City Movement, which was a broader attempt to reform living conditions for 'workers' as a whole. The Garden City Movement developed in the context of attempts to reform low-income inner city housing in order to improve conditions for the poor. The first attempts came from industrialists such as Titus Salt and the Lever brothers, who developed housing for their workers within walking distance of their factories. The aim of garden cities was to create an urban planning model designed to promote healthier communities in response to problems encountered by rapid urbanisation. The intention was also to create communities with a balanced approach to living conditions, industry, agriculture and recreation.

', ""The Fundamental Rights in India enshrined in part III (Article 12–35) of the Constitution of India guarantee civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as citizens of India. These rights are known as 'fundamental' as they are the most essential for all-round development i.e., material, intellectual, moral and spiritual and protected by fundamental law of the land i.e. constitution. If the rights provided by Constitution especially the Fundamental rights are violated the Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue writs under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, respectively, directing the State Machinery for enforcement of the fundamental rights. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms where every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality and life. These rights apply universally to all citizens of India, irrespective of their race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to certain restrictions. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. Fundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and hence prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour.

These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may be imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences and defamation. The State is also empowered, in the interests of the general public to nationalize any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens. The freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are further sought to be protected by Articles 20–22. The scope of these articles, particularly with respect to the doctrine of due process, was heavily debated by the Constituent Assembly. It was argued, especially by Benegal Narsing Rau, that the incorporation of such a clause would hamper social legislation and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order, and therefore it ought to be excluded from the Constitution altogether. The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase 'due process' in favor of 'procedure established by law'. As a result, Article 21, which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by law, was, until 1978, construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action. However, in 1978, the Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action, holding that any law laying down a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable, and effectively reading due process into Article 21. In the same case, the Supreme Court also ruled that 'life' under Article 21 meant more than a mere 'animal existence'; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life 'meaningful, complete and worth living'. Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood, good health, clean environment, water, speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned.

', ""New Earswick is a model village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire, England, near the River Foss, north of York and south of Haxby. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,812, reducing to 2,737 at the 2011 Census. The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority. History The village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, 'I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities'. The first 28 houses were designed between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new village. The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Hartrigg Oaks Complex The village had contemporaries such as Bournville, Saltaire, Port Sunlight and others. It presented a sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the 19th century, the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree's report of 1901, entitled Poverty: a study of town life. It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and insanitary housing. As a result of the report, Joseph Rowntree's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new 'garden' village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. "", 'Garden Village of New EarswickListenThe ‘garden village’ of New Earswick on the northern side of York influenced housing patterns in England and elsewhere for more than 60 years of the 20th century. It was built for Joseph Rowntree (1835-1925) the Quaker chocolate and cocoa manufacturer whose factory was nearby. Construction began in 1902 the year after the publication by Rowntree’s son, Seebohm Rowntree (1871-1954) of his social survey of York, Poverty: a study of town life. The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall. Many of the houses were built in cul-de-sacs which set an example that was copied by builders all over England in the 1920s and 30s. There are extensive open spaces and many trees. Bricks were made from local clay, and the site of the brickyard, which closed in the 1930s, is now a nature reserve.Enlarge mapShrink mapNavigateYour Location?Garden Village of New Earswick ', ""I have recently being doing some work at New Earswick in York, founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree and designed by the practice of Parker and Unwin. The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 and then over successive periods until the present day. What strikes me about the settlement, is how relevant it is to the needs of today, in creating a lovely place to live, set in a sylvan setting, with ample community facilities for the benefit of all. It is a wonderful place to explore on foot, walking down tree lined avenues free from cars and observing modest crafted homes, set behind manicured low hedges. A somewhat idyllic place to engage the fusion of day to day living and nature. It is important to understand the place of New Earswick within the wider Garden City Movement, which was a broader attempt to reform living conditions for 'workers' as a whole. The Garden City Movement developed in the context of attempts to reform low-income inner city housing in order to improve conditions for the poor. The first attempts came from industrialists such as Titus Salt and the Lever brothers, who developed housing for their workers within walking distance of their factories. The aim of garden cities was to create an urban planning model designed to promote healthier communities in response to problems encountered by rapid urbanisation. The intention was also to create communities with a balanced approach to living conditions, industry, agriculture and recreation.

The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall. Many of the houses were built in cul-de-sacs which set an example that was copied by builders all over England in the 1920s and 30s. There are extensive open spaces and many trees. Bricks were made from local clay, and the site of the brickyard, which closed in the 1930s, is now a nature reserve.Enlarge mapShrink mapNavigateYour Location?Garden Village of New Earswick ', ""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/garden-villages-making-history-ric-blenkharn\nI have recently being doing some work at New Earswick in York, founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree and designed by the practice of Parker and Unwin. The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 and then over successive periods until the present day. What strikes me about the settlement, is how relevant it is to the needs of today, in creating a lovely place to live, set in a sylvan setting, with ample community facilities for the benefit of all. It is a wonderful place to explore on foot, walking down tree lined avenues free from cars and observing modest crafted homes, set behind manicured low hedges. A somewhat idyllic place to engage the fusion of day to day living and nature. It is important to understand the place of New Earswick within the wider Garden City Movement, which was a broader attempt to reform living conditions for 'workers' as a whole. The Garden City Movement developed in the context of attempts to reform low-income inner city housing in order to improve conditions for the poor. The first attempts came from industrialists such as Titus Salt and the Lever brothers, who developed housing for their workers within walking distance of their factories. The aim of garden cities was to create an urban planning model designed to promote healthier communities in response to problems encountered by rapid urbanisation. The intention was also to create communities with a balanced approach to living conditions, industry, agriculture and recreation. "", ""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/garden-villages-making-history-ric-blenkharn\nThe village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. The village had contemporaries such as Bournville, Saltaire and Port Sunlight. This was in sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the previous century, the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree's report of 1901, entitled Poverty: a study of town life. It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and insanitary housing. ""]","[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Earswick\nNew Earswick is a model village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire, England, near the River Foss, north of York and south of Haxby. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,812, reducing to 2,737 at the 2011 Census. The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and insanitary housing. As a result of the report, Joseph Rowntree's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new 'garden' village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City.

The office was created in 1773, with the title of Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William. The officer had direct control only over his presidency but supervised other East India Company officials in India. Complete authority over all of British territory in the Indian subcontinent was granted in 1833, and the official came to be known as the 'Governor-General of India'. "", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_India\nThe title of Viceroy was abandoned when British India was partitioned into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan, but the office of governor-general continued to exist in each country separately until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956, respectively. Until 1858, the governor-general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, to whom he was responsible. Thereafter, he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British Government; the Secretary of State for India, a member of the British Cabinet, was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of their powers. After 1947, the sovereign continued to appoint the governor-general but thereafter did so on the advice of the government of the newly independent Dominion of India. The governor-general served at the pleasure of the sovereign, though the practice was to have them serve five-year terms. A governor-general could have their commission rescinded; and if one was removed, or left, a provisional governor-general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen. The first governor-general in India (of Bengal) was Warren Hastings, the first official governor-general of British India was Lord William Bentinck, and the first governor-general of the Dominion of India was Lord Mountbatten. History Warren Hastings, the first governor-general of Fort William from 1773 to 1785. Lord William Bentinck, the first governor general of India from 1834 – 1835 ', ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_India\nAfter the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British East India Company's territories in India were put under the direct control of the sovereign. The Government of India Act 1858 vested the power to appoint the governor-general in the sovereign. The governor-general, in turn, had the power to appoint all lieutenant governors in India, subject to the sovereign's approval. India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947, but governors-general continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written. \x1b[95m[1] Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, remained governor-general of India for ten months after independence\x1b[0m, but the two nations were otherwise headed by native governors-general.

Lord Mountbatten addressing the Chamber of Princes as Crown Representative in the 1940s "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_India\nWhile the governor-general thus became the controller of foreign policy in India, he was not the explicit head of British India. That status came only with the Charter Act 1833, which granted him 'superintendence, direction and control of the whole civil and military Government' of all of British India. The act also granted legislative powers to the governor-general and council. in 1835, Lord William Bentinck became the first governor general of India. After 1858, the governor-general (now usually known as the viceroy) functioned as the chief administrator of India and as the sovereign's representative. India was divided into numerous provinces, each under the head of a governor, lieutenant governor or chief commissioner or administrator. Governors were appointed by the British government, to whom they were directly responsible; lieutenant governors, chief commissioners, and administrators, however, were appointed by and were subordinate to the viceroy. The viceroy also oversaw the most powerful princely rulers: the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja (Scindia) of Gwalior, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Gaekwad (Gaekwar) Maharaja of Baroda. The remaining princely rulers were overseen either by the Rajputana Agency and Central India Agency, which were headed by representatives of the viceroy or by provincial authorities. "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_India\nThe governor-general was styled Excellency and enjoyed precedence over all other government officials in India. He was referred to as 'His Excellency' and addressed as 'Your Excellency'. From 1858 to 1947, the governor-general was known as the viceroy of India (from the French roi, meaning 'king'), and wives of Viceroys were known as Vicereines (from the French reine, meaning 'queen'). The Vicereine was referred to as 'Her Excellency' and was also addressed as 'Your Excellency'. Neither title was employed while the Sovereign was in India. However, the only British sovereign to visit India during the period of British rule was George V, who attended the Delhi Durbar in 1911 with his wife, Mary.[citation needed] When the Order of the Star of India was founded in 1861, the viceroy was made its grand master ex officio. The viceroy was also made the ex officio grand master of the Order of the Indian Empire upon its foundation in 1877. Most governors-general and viceroys were peers. Frequently, a viceroy who was already a peer would be granted a peerage of higher rank, as with the granting of a marquessate to Lord Reading and an earldom and later a marquessate to Freeman Freeman-Thomas. Of those viceroys who were not peers, Sir John Shore was a baronet, and Lord William Bentinck was entitled to the courtesy title 'lord' because he was the son of a duke. Only the first and last governors-general – Warren Hastings and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari – as well as some provisional governors-general, had no honorific titles at all.

An ‘escape from empire’ had to be contrived. The ‘Transfer of Power’ negotiations included leaders of the Muslim League, the Congress, and representatives of the British Cabinet (pictured here with Gandhi). After months of efforts to reach a rapprochement between the Congress and the League, it became clear that the Congress was not willing to recognise the League as the representative of India’s Muslims or grant the safeguards it demanded on their behalf. Lord Louis Mountbatten, sent out to oversee the handover of power, decided that instead of taking two years to organise the partition process, as was originally envisaged, he would wrap it up in under six months.

These rights are known as 'fundamental' as they are the most essential for all-round development i.e., material, intellectual, moral and spiritual and protected by fundamental law of the land i.e. constitution. If the rights provided by Constitution especially the Fundamental rights are violated the Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue writs under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, respectively, directing the State Machinery for enforcement of the fundamental rights. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms where every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality and life. These rights apply universally to all citizens of India, irrespective of their race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to certain restrictions. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. Fundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and hence prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour. They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions.

Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may be imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences and defamation. The State is also empowered, in the interests of the general public to nationalize any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens. The freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are further sought to be protected by Articles 20–22. The scope of these articles, particularly with respect to the doctrine of due process, was heavily debated by the Constituent Assembly. It was argued, especially by Benegal Narsing Rau, that the incorporation of such a clause would hamper social legislation and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order, and therefore it ought to be excluded from the Constitution altogether. The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase 'due process' in favor of 'procedure established by law'. As a result, Article 21, which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by law, was, until 1978, construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action. However, in 1978, the Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action, holding that any law laying down a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable, and effectively reading due process into Article 21. In the same case, the Supreme Court also ruled that 'life' under Article 21 meant more than a mere 'animal existence'; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life 'meaningful, complete and worth living'. Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood, good health, clean environment, water, speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned. The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the Fundamental Rights under Article 21A by the 86th Constitutional amendment of 2002.

""]","[""The Fundamental Rights in India enshrined in part III (Article 12–35) of the Constitution of India guarantee civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as citizens of India. These rights are known as 'fundamental' as they are the most essential for all-round development i.e., material, intellectual, moral and spiritual and protected by fundamental law of the land i.e. constitution. If the rights provided by Constitution especially the Fundamental rights are violated the Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue writs under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, respectively, directing the State Machinery for enforcement of the fundamental rights. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms where every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality and life. These rights apply universally to all citizens of India, irrespective of their race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to certain restrictions. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. Fundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and hence prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour.

The reaction occurs when the red blood cells that were given during the transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system. When red blood cells are destroyed, the process is called hemolysis.There are other types of transfusion reactions that do not cause hemolysis, such as febrile (causing fever) transfusion reactions.Causes "", 'Transfusion of ABO major-incompatible red blood cells (RBCs) can activate the complement system and can cause severe and even lethal acute hemolytic reactions. The activation of the complement system with formation of C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins) and the release of hemoglobin from the lysed RBCs are thought to mediate clinical signs like fever, hypotension, pain, and acute renal failure. Therapeutic inhibition of the complement cascade in case of ABO-incompatible RBC transfusion would be desirable to ameliorate the signs and symptoms and to improve the outcome of the reaction. Study design and methods: A patient with blood group B was erroneously transfused with a unit of group A2 RBCs. Within 1 hour after transfusion she received eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the complement component C5 and blocks its cleavage. Clinical and immunohematologic observations are reported here. Results: ', ""RBC transfusions are used to treat hemorrhage and to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Transfusion of RBCs should be based on the patient's clinical condition.4 Indications for RBC transfusion include acute sickle cell crisis (for stroke prevention), or acute blood loss of greater than 1,500 mL or 30 percent of blood volume.4 Patients with symptomatic anemia should be transfused if they cannot function without treating the anemia.4 Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, reduced exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, changes in mental status, muscle cramps, and angina or severe congestive heart failure. The 10/30 rule—transfusion when a patient has a hemoglobin level less than or equal to 10 g per dL (100 g per L) and a hematocrit level less than or equal to 30 percent—was used until the 1980s as the trigger to transfuse, regardless of the patient's clinical presentation.4,5 "", ""Hemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by immune destruction of transfused RBCs, which are attacked by the recipient's antibodies. The antibodies to the antigens of the ABO blood group or alloantibodies to other RBC antigens are produced after immunization through a previous transfusion or pregnancy. There are two categories of hemolytic transfusion reactions: acute and delayed. Nonimmune causes of acute reactions include bacterial overgrowth, improper storing, infusion with incompatible medications, and infusion of blood through lines containing hypotonic solutions or small-bore intravenous tubes.16,18,19 In acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, there is a destruction of the donor's RBCs within 24 hours of transfusion. Hemolysis may be intravascular or extravascular. The most common type is extravascular hemolysis, which occurs when donor RBCs coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) or complement are attacked in the liver or spleen.17 Intravascular hemolysis is a severe form of hemolysis caused by ABO antibodies. Symptoms of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions include fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, hypotension, diffuse bleeding, hemoglobinuria, oliguria, anuria, pain at the infusion site; and chest, back, and abdominal pain.19 Associated complications are clinically significant anemia, acute or exacerbated renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, need for dialysis, and death secondary to complications.18 The incidence of acute hemolytic reactions is approximately one to five per 50,000 transfusions.19 From 1996 to 2007, there were 213 ABO-incompatible RBC transfusions with 24 deaths.17 Systems using bar codes for blood and patient identification have decreased errors.17 ALLERGIC REACTIONS Allergic reactions range from mild (urticarial) to life threatening (anaphylactic). Urticarial allergic reactions are defined by hives or pruritus.20 Patients experiencing allergic transfusion reactions have been sensitized to the antigens in the donor unit. These antigens are soluble, and the associated reaction is dose-dependent. Allergic transfusion reactions occur in 1 to 3 percent of transfusions.16 "", 'Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when ABO-incompatible blood is transfused, resulting in recipient antibodies attaching to donor RBC antigens and forming an antigen-antibody complex. This antigen-antibody complex activates complement, resulting in intravascular RBC lysis with release of RBC stroma and free Hb. Immune system activation also results in bradykinin release (leading to hypotension) and mast cell activation (causing serotonin and histamine release). The net result may be shock, renal failure due to Hb precipitation in renal tubules, and DIC. Many signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction appear immediately and include fever, chest pain, anxiety, back pain, and dyspnea. Many are masked by general anesthesia, but clues to the diagnosis include fever, hypotension, hemoglobinuria, unexplained bleeding, or failure of Hct to increase after transfusion. The incidence of fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction in the US is approximately 1 of every 250,000 to 1,000,000 units transfused. Most reactions occur because of administrative errors, with most due to improper identification of the blood unit or patient. The importance of adhering to strict policies of checking blood and matching to the correct patient in the operating room cannot be overemphasized. ', 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are the most common transfusion reactions, occurring in approximately 1% of RBC transfusions and up to 30% of platelet transfusions. They occur when anti-leukocyte antibodies in a recipient react with white blood cells in a transfused blood product. Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, tachycardia, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Approach to treatment involves first stopping the transfusion and excluding an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction or bacterial contamination of the donor unit. Acetaminophen and meperidine may diminish fever and rigors. Once the diagnosis of FNHTR has been made, future reactions may be avoided or diminished by administering leukocyte-reduced blood products, premedicating at-risk patients with acetaminophen and hydrocortisone and administering the transfusion slowly. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) ', 'Cause: Patients may develop antibodies to red cell antigens. Antibodies can occur naturally, or may arise as a consequence of previous transfusion or pregnancy. A delayed haemolytic reaction occurs when a patient develops an antibody directed against an antigen on transfused red cells. The antibody may cause shortened red cell survival, with clinical features of fever, jaundice and lower than expected haemoglobin following transfusion. Most delayed haemolytic reactions produce few symptoms and may go unrecognised, however there are reports of serious consequences in critically ill patients. Prevention: An antibody screen is performed as part of pre-transfusion testing. When an antibody is detected, it is identified and appropriate antigen negative blood is provided. Sometimes antibodies fall below detectable limits and may not be detected by pretransfusion testing. Alloimmunisation Red Blood Cells ', 'A hemolytic reaction happens when the body attacks the donated RBCs. This happens if a person gets a blood type that their blood isn’t compatible with. Donated blood goes through a very careful matching process, so this reaction is very rare. If it does happen, it can cause chills, fever, kidney damage, and other serious symptoms. Symptoms can happen during the blood transfusion or in the next several hours. A delayed hemolytic reaction can also happen. This can happen even if your child received the right blood type. This may take days or weeks to happen. It may not cause any symptoms, but it can cause your child’s RBC count to be lower. Too much blood in the body (transfusion overload).

Perplexing discoveries have ignited explorers’ imaginations: a flat stone inscribed in code; a flood tunnel draining from a man-made beach; a torn scrap of parchment; stone markers forming a huge cross. Swaths of the island were bulldozed looking for answers; excavation attempts have claimed two lives.

The office was created in 1773, with the title of Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William. The officer had direct control only over his presidency but supervised other East India Company officials in India. Complete authority over all of British territory in the Indian subcontinent was granted in 1833, and the official came to be known as the 'Governor-General of India'. "", 'The title of Viceroy was abandoned when British India was partitioned into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan, but the office of governor-general continued to exist in each country separately until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956, respectively. Until 1858, the governor-general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, to whom he was responsible. Thereafter, he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British Government; the Secretary of State for India, a member of the British Cabinet, was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of their powers. After 1947, the sovereign continued to appoint the governor-general but thereafter did so on the advice of the government of the newly independent Dominion of India. The governor-general served at the pleasure of the sovereign, though the practice was to have them serve five-year terms. A governor-general could have their commission rescinded; and if one was removed, or left, a provisional governor-general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen. The first governor-general in India (of Bengal) was Warren Hastings, the first official governor-general of British India was Lord William Bentinck, and the first governor-general of the Dominion of India was Lord Mountbatten.

The Government of India Act 1858 vested the power to appoint the governor-general in the sovereign. The governor-general, in turn, had the power to appoint all lieutenant governors in India, subject to the sovereign's approval. India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947, but governors-general continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, remained governor-general of India for ten months after independence, but the two nations were otherwise headed by native governors-general.

The act also granted legislative powers to the governor-general and council. in 1835, Lord William Bentinck became the first governor general of India. After 1858, the governor-general (now usually known as the viceroy) functioned as the chief administrator of India and as the sovereign's representative. India was divided into numerous provinces, each under the head of a governor, lieutenant governor or chief commissioner or administrator. Governors were appointed by the British government, to whom they were directly responsible; lieutenant governors, chief commissioners, and administrators, however, were appointed by and were subordinate to the viceroy. The viceroy also oversaw the most powerful princely rulers: the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja (Scindia) of Gwalior, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Gaekwad (Gaekwar) Maharaja of Baroda. The remaining princely rulers were overseen either by the Rajputana Agency and Central India Agency, which were headed by representatives of the viceroy or by provincial authorities.

From 1858 to 1947, the governor-general was known as the viceroy of India (from the French roi, meaning 'king'), and wives of Viceroys were known as Vicereines (from the French reine, meaning 'queen'). The Vicereine was referred to as 'Her Excellency' and was also addressed as 'Your Excellency'. Neither title was employed while the Sovereign was in India. However, the only British sovereign to visit India during the period of British rule was George V, who attended the Delhi Durbar in 1911 with his wife, Mary.[citation needed] When the Order of the Star of India was founded in 1861, the viceroy was made its grand master ex officio. The viceroy was also made the ex officio grand master of the Order of the Indian Empire upon its foundation in 1877. Most governors-general and viceroys were peers. Frequently, a viceroy who was already a peer would be granted a peerage of higher rank, as with the granting of a marquessate to Lord Reading and an earldom and later a marquessate to Freeman Freeman-Thomas. Of those viceroys who were not peers, Sir John Shore was a baronet, and Lord William Bentinck was entitled to the courtesy title 'lord' because he was the son of a duke.

The reaction occurs when the red blood cells that were given during the transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system. When red blood cells are destroyed, the process is called hemolysis.There are other types of transfusion reactions that do not cause hemolysis, such as febrile (causing fever) transfusion reactions.Causes "", 'Transfusion of ABO major-incompatible red blood cells (RBCs) can activate the complement system and can cause severe and even lethal acute hemolytic reactions. The activation of the complement system with formation of C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins) and the release of hemoglobin from the lysed RBCs are thought to mediate clinical signs like fever, hypotension, pain, and acute renal failure. Therapeutic inhibition of the complement cascade in case of ABO-incompatible RBC transfusion would be desirable to ameliorate the signs and symptoms and to improve the outcome of the reaction. Study design and methods: A patient with blood group B was erroneously transfused with a unit of group A2 RBCs. Within 1 hour after transfusion she received eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the complement component C5 and blocks its cleavage. Clinical and immunohematologic observations are reported here. Results: ', ""RBC transfusions are used to treat hemorrhage and to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Transfusion of RBCs should be based on the patient's clinical condition.4 Indications for RBC transfusion include acute sickle cell crisis (for stroke prevention), or acute blood loss of greater than 1,500 mL or 30 percent of blood volume.4 Patients with symptomatic anemia should be transfused if they cannot function without treating the anemia.4 Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, reduced exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, changes in mental status, muscle cramps, and angina or severe congestive heart failure. The 10/30 rule—transfusion when a patient has a hemoglobin level less than or equal to 10 g per dL (100 g per L) and a hematocrit level less than or equal to 30 percent—was used until the 1980s as the trigger to transfuse, regardless of the patient's clinical presentation.4,5 "", ""Hemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by immune destruction of transfused RBCs, which are attacked by the recipient's antibodies. The antibodies to the antigens of the ABO blood group or alloantibodies to other RBC antigens are produced after immunization through a previous transfusion or pregnancy. There are two categories of hemolytic transfusion reactions: acute and delayed. Nonimmune causes of acute reactions include bacterial overgrowth, improper storing, infusion with incompatible medications, and infusion of blood through lines containing hypotonic solutions or small-bore intravenous tubes.16,18,19 In acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, there is a destruction of the donor's RBCs within 24 hours of transfusion. Hemolysis may be intravascular or extravascular. The most common type is extravascular hemolysis, which occurs when donor RBCs coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) or complement are attacked in the liver or spleen.17 Intravascular hemolysis is a severe form of hemolysis caused by ABO antibodies. Symptoms of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions include fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, hypotension, diffuse bleeding, hemoglobinuria, oliguria, anuria, pain at the infusion site; and chest, back, and abdominal pain.19 Associated complications are clinically significant anemia, acute or exacerbated renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, need for dialysis, and death secondary to complications.18 The incidence of acute hemolytic reactions is approximately one to five per 50,000 transfusions.19 From 1996 to 2007, there were 213 ABO-incompatible RBC transfusions with 24 deaths.17 Systems using bar codes for blood and patient identification have decreased errors.17 ALLERGIC REACTIONS Allergic reactions range from mild (urticarial) to life threatening (anaphylactic). Urticarial allergic reactions are defined by hives or pruritus.20 Patients experiencing allergic transfusion reactions have been sensitized to the antigens in the donor unit. These antigens are soluble, and the associated reaction is dose-dependent. Allergic transfusion reactions occur in 1 to 3 percent of transfusions.16 "", 'Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when ABO-incompatible blood is transfused, resulting in recipient antibodies attaching to donor RBC antigens and forming an antigen-antibody complex. This antigen-antibody complex activates complement, resulting in intravascular RBC lysis with release of RBC stroma and free Hb. Immune system activation also results in bradykinin release (leading to hypotension) and mast cell activation (causing serotonin and histamine release). The net result may be shock, renal failure due to Hb precipitation in renal tubules, and DIC. Many signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction appear immediately and include fever, chest pain, anxiety, back pain, and dyspnea. Many are masked by general anesthesia, but clues to the diagnosis include fever, hypotension, hemoglobinuria, unexplained bleeding, or failure of Hct to increase after transfusion. The incidence of fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction in the US is approximately 1 of every 250,000 to 1,000,000 units transfused. Most reactions occur because of administrative errors, with most due to improper identification of the blood unit or patient. The importance of adhering to strict policies of checking blood and matching to the correct patient in the operating room cannot be overemphasized. ', 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are the most common transfusion reactions, occurring in approximately 1% of RBC transfusions and up to 30% of platelet transfusions. They occur when anti-leukocyte antibodies in a recipient react with white blood cells in a transfused blood product. Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, tachycardia, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Approach to treatment involves first stopping the transfusion and excluding an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction or bacterial contamination of the donor unit. Acetaminophen and meperidine may diminish fever and rigors. Once the diagnosis of FNHTR has been made, future reactions may be avoided or diminished by administering leukocyte-reduced blood products, premedicating at-risk patients with acetaminophen and hydrocortisone and administering the transfusion slowly. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) ', 'Cause: Patients may develop antibodies to red cell antigens. Antibodies can occur naturally, or may arise as a consequence of previous transfusion or pregnancy. A delayed haemolytic reaction occurs when a patient develops an antibody directed against an antigen on transfused red cells. The antibody may cause shortened red cell survival, with clinical features of fever, jaundice and lower than expected haemoglobin following transfusion. Most delayed haemolytic reactions produce few symptoms and may go unrecognised, however there are reports of serious consequences in critically ill patients. Prevention: An antibody screen is performed as part of pre-transfusion testing. When an antibody is detected, it is identified and appropriate antigen negative blood is provided. Sometimes antibodies fall below detectable limits and may not be detected by pretransfusion testing. Alloimmunisation Red Blood Cells ', 'A hemolytic reaction happens when the body attacks the donated RBCs. This happens if a person gets a blood type that their blood isn’t compatible with. Donated blood goes through a very careful matching process, so this reaction is very rare. If it does happen, it can cause chills, fever, kidney damage, and other serious symptoms. Symptoms can happen during the blood transfusion or in the next several hours. A delayed hemolytic reaction can also happen. This can happen even if your child received the right blood type. This may take days or weeks to happen. It may not cause any symptoms, but it can cause your child’s RBC count to be lower. Too much blood in the body (transfusion overload). Transfusion overload may happen if a person gets more blood than needed. It can cause shortness of breath and other symptoms. The symptoms usually happen within a few hours to a day. It’s more common in people with heart problems.

Within 1 hour after transfusion she received eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the complement component C5 and blocks its cleavage. Clinical and immunohematologic observations are reported here. Results: ', ""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2011/0315/p719.html\nRBC transfusions are used to treat hemorrhage and to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Transfusion of RBCs should be based on the patient's clinical condition.4 Indications for RBC transfusion include acute sickle cell crisis (for stroke prevention), or acute blood loss of greater than 1,500 mL or 30 percent of blood volume.4 Patients with symptomatic anemia should be transfused if they cannot function without treating the anemia.4 Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, reduced exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, changes in mental status, muscle cramps, and angina or severe congestive heart failure. The 10/30 rule—transfusion when a patient has a hemoglobin level less than or equal to 10 g per dL (100 g per L) and a hematocrit level less than or equal to 30 percent—was used until the 1980s as the trigger to transfuse, regardless of the patient's clinical presentation.4,5 "", ""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2011/0315/p719.html\nHemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by immune destruction of transfused RBCs, which are attacked by the recipient's antibodies. The antibodies to the antigens of the ABO blood group or alloantibodies to other RBC antigens are produced after immunization through a previous transfusion or pregnancy. There are two categories of hemolytic transfusion reactions: acute and delayed. Nonimmune causes of acute reactions include bacterial overgrowth, improper storing, infusion with incompatible medications, and infusion of blood through lines containing hypotonic solutions or small-bore intravenous tubes.16,18,19 \x1b[1;31;60m[1] In acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, there is a destruction of the donor's RBCs within 24 hours of transfusion\x1b[0m. Hemolysis may be intravascular or extravascular. The most common type is extravascular hemolysis, which occurs when donor RBCs coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) or complement are attacked in the liver or spleen.17 Intravascular hemolysis is a severe form of hemolysis caused by ABO antibodies. Symptoms of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions include fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, hypotension, diffuse bleeding, hemoglobinuria, oliguria, anuria, pain at the infusion site; and chest, back, and abdominal pain.19 Associated complications are clinically significant anemia, acute or exacerbated renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, need for dialysis, and death secondary to complications.18 The incidence of acute hemolytic reactions is approximately one to five per 50,000 transfusions.19 From 1996 to 2007, there were 213 ABO-incompatible RBC transfusions with 24 deaths.17 Systems using bar codes for blood and patient identification have decreased errors.17 ALLERGIC REACTIONS Allergic reactions range from mild (urticarial) to life threatening (anaphylactic). Urticarial allergic reactions are defined by hives or pruritus.20 Patients experiencing allergic transfusion reactions have been sensitized to the antigens in the donor unit. These antigens are soluble, and the associated reaction is dose-dependent. Allergic transfusion reactions occur in 1 to 3 percent of transfusions.16 "", 'https://www.medstarhealth.org/news-and-publications/articles-and-research-reports/complications-of-blood-transfusion\n\x1b[102m[2] Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when ABO-incompatible blood is transfused, resulting in recipient antibodies attaching to donor RBC antigens and forming an antigen-antibody complex\x1b[0m. This antigen-antibody complex activates complement, resulting in \x1b[102m[3] intravascular RBC lysis with release of RBC stroma and free Hb\x1b[0m. Immune system activation also results in bradykinin release (leading to hypotension) and mast cell activation (causing serotonin and histamine release). The net result may be shock, renal failure due to Hb precipitation in renal tubules, and DIC. Many signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction appear immediately and include fever, chest pain, anxiety, back pain, and dyspnea. Many are masked by general anesthesia, but clues to the diagnosis include fever, hypotension, hemoglobinuria, unexplained bleeding, or failure of Hct to increase after transfusion. The incidence of fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction in the US is approximately 1 of every 250,000 to 1,000,000 units transfused. Most reactions occur because of administrative errors, with most due to improper identification of the blood unit or patient. The importance of adhering to strict policies of checking blood and matching to the correct patient in the operating room cannot be overemphasized. ', 'https://www.medstarhealth.org/news-and-publications/articles-and-research-reports/complications-of-blood-transfusion\nFebrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are the most common transfusion reactions, occurring in approximately 1% of RBC transfusions and up to 30% of platelet transfusions. They occur when anti-leukocyte antibodies in a recipient react with white blood cells in a transfused blood product. Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, tachycardia, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Approach to treatment involves first stopping the transfusion and excluding an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction or bacterial contamination of the donor unit. Acetaminophen and meperidine may diminish fever and rigors. Once the diagnosis of FNHTR has been made, future reactions may be avoided or diminished by administering leukocyte-reduced blood products, premedicating at-risk patients with acetaminophen and hydrocortisone and administering the transfusion slowly. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) ', 'https://www.rch.org.au/bloodtrans/adverse_effects/Adverse_effects_of_transfusion/\nCause: Patients may develop antibodies to red cell antigens. Antibodies can occur naturally, or may arise as a consequence of previous transfusion or pregnancy. A delayed haemolytic reaction occurs when a patient develops an antibody directed against an antigen on transfused red cells. The antibody may cause shortened red cell survival, with clinical features of fever, jaundice and lower than expected haemoglobin following transfusion. Most delayed haemolytic reactions produce few symptoms and may go unrecognised, however there are reports of serious consequences in critically ill patients. Prevention: An antibody screen is performed as part of pre-transfusion testing. When an antibody is detected, it is identified and appropriate antigen negative blood is provided. Sometimes antibodies fall below detectable limits and may not be detected by pretransfusion testing. Alloimmunisation Red Blood Cells ', 'https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=161&contentid=101\nA hemolytic reaction happens when the body attacks the donated RBCs. This happens if a person gets a blood type that their blood isn’t compatible with. Donated blood goes through a very careful matching process, so this reaction is very rare. If it does happen, it can cause chills, fever, kidney damage, and other serious symptoms. Symptoms can happen during the blood transfusion or in the next several hours. A delayed hemolytic reaction can also happen. This can happen even if your child received the right blood type. This may take days or weeks to happen. It may not cause any symptoms, but it can cause your child’s RBC count to be lower. Too much blood in the body (transfusion overload). Transfusion overload may happen if a person gets more blood than needed. It can cause shortness of breath and other symptoms. The symptoms usually happen within a few hours to a day.

"", ""‘Wade in the Water’ originated in the southern US in the mid-1800s, as a spiritual sung by enslaved African-Americans. In those communities, spirituals were more than just expressions of religious devotion. Some spirituals would be sung to alert freedom-seekers when it was safest to escape, without slaveholders ('masters') knowing that information was being communicated.  The lyrics of ‘Wade in the Water’ reference the Biblical story of the Israelites crossing the river Jordan, but the lyrics also remind those seeking freedom to walk in the rivers along their journey, so that tracking dogs and slave-catchers could not follow their footprints or their scent. ‘Wade in the Water’ became one of the best-known spirituals in the African-American community, but it wasn’t more broadly known until it was performed by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. This a capella group was formed at Fisk University in Nashville, established in 1867 to educate freed men and women. In 1871, the Singers were sent on a US tour to raise money for the financially struggling university. That November, they appeared at a national convention of ministers, where, according to their website, '[a]fter a few standard ballads the chorus sang spirituals and other songs associated with slavery. It was one of the first public performances of the secret music African-Americans sang in the fields and behind closed doors for generations.' Further tours by the Singers, including trips to Europe and Australia, and the publication of the song’s music and lyrics in the early 1900s took ‘Wade in the Water’ to even larger national and international audiences. The song was first recorded in ‘25 by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers, and was performed and recorded by many other gospel and spiritual singing groups in the early part of the 20th century, in addition to being a popular hymn in African-American churches. But it gradually became part of popular music as well. At the dawn of the 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained momentum in the US, there was a revival of interest in traditional folk music and in African-American culture. That made ‘Wade in the Water’ part of the soundtrack to that turbulent decade – both as a vocal number and as an instrumental. "", ""'Wade in the Water' entered the soul-jazz repertory in the late 1950s. When musicians took to quoting the first bars of the melody while soloing on other tunes, they were alluding to the song’s coded past life, using it as a signifier to the hip and racially conscious. The first modern jazz recording was a swaggering arrangement by Johnny Griffin’s Big Soul Band in 1960. By 1965, Graham Bond had hold of the song: the album version was short, but live it could take 10 minutes before Jack Bruce on bass and drummer Ginger Baker slammed in with gritty R&B and a template for heavy rock trio Cream. ArtsThe Life of a Song: Wade in the Water A year later the opening brass fanfare, driving tambourine, soul-stirring handclap and joyful piano of the Ramsey Lewis Trio’s million-selling version became a longstanding club classic and a northern soul staple. "", ""The song 'Wade In The Water' is a traditional African American spiritual with deep historical roots. The lyrics convey a message of deliverance and redemption, using the metaphor of water as a medium for change and divine intervention. The repeated line 'God's gonna trouble the water' suggests that God will stir the waters of life, creating a path to freedom or a transformational challenge that must be faced. The reference to the children dressed in red 'must be the ones that Moses led' alludes to the biblical story of the Exodus, where Moses leads the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, which is a powerful symbol of liberation and hope for the African American slaves who originally sang this song.The spiritual is also believed to have had a practical application during the era of the Underground Railroad, where coded messages within the song provided guidance to escaping slaves. The instruction to 'wade in the water' could have been a directive to avoid being tracked by scent dogs. The mention of walking down the highway with 'nowhere to go' reflects the uncertainty and peril faced by those seeking freedom, yet the song remains resolute in its encouragement to keep moving forward, trusting in divine providence.The enduring legacy of 'Wade In The Water' lies in its ability to inspire and uplift. It has been interpreted and recorded by numerous artists over the years, each bringing their own perspective to this powerful anthem. The song's themes of struggle, faith, and the quest for freedom resonate just as strongly today as they did in the past, making it a timeless piece of musical heritage. "", ""With that background, let us explore the use of Scripture in this spiritual and some theological themes these passages might represent. The refrain of 'Wade in the Water' is based upon the narrative of John 5:2-9. It is the story of the pool by the Sheep Gate—Bethzatha in Hebrew. A portion of this passage follows: 'Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

That November, they appeared at a national convention of ministers, where, according to their website, '[a]fter a few standard ballads the chorus sang spirituals and other songs associated with slavery. It was one of the first public performances of the secret music African-Americans sang in the fields and behind closed doors for generations.' Further tours by the Singers, including trips to Europe and Australia, and the publication of the song’s music and lyrics in the early 1900s took ‘Wade in the Water’ to even larger national and international audiences. The song was first recorded in ‘25 by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers, and was performed and recorded by many other gospel and spiritual singing groups in the early part of the 20th century, in addition to being a popular hymn in African-American churches. But it gradually became part of popular music as well. At the dawn of the 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained momentum in the US, there was a revival of interest in traditional folk music and in African-American culture. That made ‘Wade in the Water’ part of the soundtrack to that turbulent decade – both as a vocal number and as an instrumental. "", ""'Wade in the Water' entered the soul-jazz repertory in the late 1950s. When musicians took to quoting the first bars of the melody while soloing on other tunes, they were alluding to the song’s coded past life, using it as a signifier to the hip and racially conscious. The first modern jazz recording was a swaggering arrangement by Johnny Griffin’s Big Soul Band in 1960.

"", ""The song 'Wade In The Water' is a traditional African American spiritual with deep historical roots. The lyrics convey a message of deliverance and redemption, using the metaphor of water as a medium for change and divine intervention. The repeated line 'God's gonna trouble the water' suggests that God will stir the waters of life, creating a path to freedom or a transformational challenge that must be faced. The reference to the children dressed in red 'must be the ones that Moses led' alludes to the biblical story of the Exodus, where Moses leads the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, which is a powerful symbol of liberation and hope for the African American slaves who originally sang this song.The spiritual is also believed to have had a practical application during the era of the Underground Railroad, where coded messages within the song provided guidance to escaping slaves.

The lyrics to 'Wade in the Water' were first co-published in 1901 in New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers by Frederick J. Work and his brother, John Wesley Work Jr., an educator at the historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, Fisk University. Work Jr. (1871–1925)—who is also known as John Work II—spent thirty years collecting, promoting, and reviving the songcraft of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers, which included being a member and director of the Fisk Jubilee Quartet. The Sunset Four Jubilee Singers made the first commercial recording of 'Wade in the Water' in 1925—released by Paramount Records. W. E. B. Du Bois called this genre of songs the Sorrow Songs. 'Wade in the Water' is associated with songs of the Underground Railroad. Fisk Jubilee Singers "", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_in_the_Water\nThe full mixed choir became too expensive to tour, and was replaced by John Work II's male quartet. The quartet received 'widespread acclaim' and eventually made a series of best-selling recordings for Victor in December 1909, February 1911, for Edison in December 1911, for Columbia is October 1915 and February 1916, and Starr in 1916.:\u200a253 In the year that Work died, 1925, the first commercial recording of the song—performed by the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers—was released by Paramount Records. In his 1925 book, Crisis, W. E. B. Du Bois mentioned 'Wade in the Water' as performed by the Norfolk Jubilee Quartet. DuBois wrote that 'You'll never tire of the melodious rich blended voices of the Norfolk Jubilee Quartet, Sunset Four, and Harrod's Jubilee Singers.':\u200a155,\u200a259 Lyrics The lyrics were first published in 1901 in New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

Perplexing discoveries have ignited explorers’ imaginations: a flat stone inscribed in code; a flood tunnel draining from a man-made beach; a torn scrap of parchment; stone markers forming a huge cross. Swaths of the island were bulldozed looking for answers; excavation attempts have claimed two lives. Theories abound as to what’s hidden on Oak Island–pirates’ treasure, Marie Antoinette’s lost jewels, the Holy Grail, proof that Sir Francis Bacon was the true author of Shakespeare’s plays–yet to this day, the Money Pit remains an enigma.

87,30,"[""λίθος (líthos) 'stone') is a chemical element; it has symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. "", ""Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is silvery-white. In air it oxidizes to lithium oxide. Its melting point of 180.50 °C (453.65 K; 356.90 °F) and its boiling point of 1,342 °C (1,615 K; 2,448 °F) are each the highest of all the alkali metals while its density of 0.534 g/cm3 is the lowest. Lithium has a very low density (0.534 g/cm3), comparable with pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is more than 60% denser. Apart from helium and hydrogen, as a solid it is less dense than any other element as a liquid, being only two-thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium. Lithium floating in oil Lithium's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures. Lithium has a mass specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin, the highest of all solids. Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications. Isotopes Main article: Isotopes of lithium Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (95.15% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than hydrogen-1, deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s. The 6Li isotope is one of only five stable nuclides to have both an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons, the other four stable odd-odd nuclides being hydrogen-2, boron-10, nitrogen-14, and tantalum-180m.

The first plan was laid out by the architects Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, who later went on to design Letchworth Garden City among many other garden city-inspired schemes. Like Letchworth, New Earswick offered low-density building, limited to ten houses per acre, with ample green space and soft landscaping. Many of the streets were named for the trees planted throughout the village: Chestnut Grove, Rowan Place and Lime Tree Avenue. The street picture at Poplar Grove, New Earswick ', 'After World War I, the village made use of government subsidies under the 1919 and later Housing Acts. Then under the direction of Barry Parker, the architectural style shifted away from Arts and Crafts and towards a Neo-Georgian form that had become popular in suburban estates. These later designs featured hipped roofs and omitted many of the ornamental features that characterised the early part of the village, partly to minimise building costs. The years after World War II marked a partial return to the earlier styles of housing, leaving three historically distinct areas in the landscape. Interwar houses Cherry Tree Avenue, New Earswick ', 'Today, the village is a designated conservation area and almost all of its pre-war houses are Grade II listed. This reflects the role that the architects’ designs would later have on the first mass council housing after World War I, through Unwin’s role as a government advisor. However, it remains a significant community in its own right, long after its lessons in architecture and planning were realised at Letchworth.

', ""New Earswick is a model village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire, England, near the River Foss, north of York and south of Haxby. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,812, reducing to 2,737 at the 2011 Census. The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority. History The village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, 'I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities'. The first 28 houses were designed between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new village. The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Hartrigg Oaks Complex The village had contemporaries such as Bournville, Saltaire, Port Sunlight and others. It presented a sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the 19th century, the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree's report of 1901, entitled Poverty: a study of town life. It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and insanitary housing. As a result of the report, Joseph Rowntree's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new 'garden' village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. "", 'Garden Village of New EarswickListenThe ‘garden village’ of New Earswick on the northern side of York influenced housing patterns in England and elsewhere for more than 60 years of the 20th century. It was built for Joseph Rowntree (1835-1925) the Quaker chocolate and cocoa manufacturer whose factory was nearby. Construction began in 1902 the year after the publication by Rowntree’s son, Seebohm Rowntree (1871-1954) of his social survey of York, Poverty: a study of town life. The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall. Many of the houses were built in cul-de-sacs which set an example that was copied by builders all over England in the 1920s and 30s. There are extensive open spaces and many trees. Bricks were made from local clay, and the site of the brickyard, which closed in the 1930s, is now a nature reserve.Enlarge mapShrink mapNavigateYour Location?Garden Village of New Earswick ', ""I have recently being doing some work at New Earswick in York, founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree and designed by the practice of Parker and Unwin. The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 and then over successive periods until the present day. What strikes me about the settlement, is how relevant it is to the needs of today, in creating a lovely place to live, set in a sylvan setting, with ample community facilities for the benefit of all. It is a wonderful place to explore on foot, walking down tree lined avenues free from cars and observing modest crafted homes, set behind manicured low hedges. A somewhat idyllic place to engage the fusion of day to day living and nature. It is important to understand the place of New Earswick within the wider Garden City Movement, which was a broader attempt to reform living conditions for 'workers' as a whole. The Garden City Movement developed in the context of attempts to reform low-income inner city housing in order to improve conditions for the poor. The first attempts came from industrialists such as Titus Salt and the Lever brothers, who developed housing for their workers within walking distance of their factories. The aim of garden cities was to create an urban planning model designed to promote healthier communities in response to problems encountered by rapid urbanisation. The intention was also to create communities with a balanced approach to living conditions, industry, agriculture and recreation.

Many of the streets were named for the trees planted throughout the village: Chestnut Grove, Rowan Place and Lime Tree Avenue. The street picture at Poplar Grove, New Earswick ', 'https://artsandcraftstours.com/new-earswick-an-interesting-experiment-near-york/\nAfter World War I, the village made use of government subsidies under the 1919 and later Housing Acts. Then under the direction of Barry Parker, the architectural style shifted away from Arts and Crafts and towards a Neo-Georgian form that had become popular in suburban estates. These later designs featured hipped roofs and omitted many of the ornamental features that characterised the early part of the village, partly to minimise building costs. The years after World War II marked a partial return to the earlier styles of housing, leaving three historically distinct areas in the landscape. Interwar houses Cherry Tree Avenue, New Earswick ', 'https://artsandcraftstours.com/new-earswick-an-interesting-experiment-near-york/\nToday, the village is a designated conservation area and almost all of its pre-war houses are Grade II listed. This reflects the role that the architects’ designs would later have on the first mass council housing after World War I, through Unwin’s role as a government advisor. However, it remains a significant community in its own right, long after its lessons in architecture and planning were realised at Letchworth. New Earswick continues to evolve today under the trust’s stewardship, adapting to suit the changing needs of the community with improved accommodation for older people and the introduction of eco-homes.

According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,812, reducing to 2,737 at the 2011 Census. The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Hartrigg Oaks Complex The village had contemporaries such as Bournville, Saltaire, Port Sunlight and others. It presented a sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the 19th century, the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree's report of 1901, entitled Poverty: a study of town life. It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and insanitary housing. As a result of the report, Joseph Rowntree's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new 'garden' village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. "", 'https://www.erih.net/i-want-to-go-there/site/garden-village-of-new-earswick\nGarden Village of New EarswickListenThe ‘garden village’ of New Earswick on the northern side of York influenced housing patterns in England and elsewhere for more than 60 years of the 20th century. It was built for Joseph Rowntree (1835-1925) the Quaker chocolate and cocoa manufacturer whose factory was nearby. Construction began in 1902 the year after the publication by Rowntree’s son, Seebohm Rowntree (1871-1954) of his social survey of York, Poverty: a study of town life. The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall. Many of the houses were built in cul-de-sacs which set an example that was copied by builders all over England in the 1920s and 30s. There are extensive open spaces and many trees. Bricks were made from local clay, and the site of the brickyard, which closed in the 1930s, is now a nature reserve.Enlarge mapShrink mapNavigateYour Location?Garden Village of New Earswick ', ""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/garden-villages-making-history-ric-blenkharn\nI have recently being doing some work at New Earswick in York, founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree and designed by the practice of Parker and Unwin. The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 and then over successive periods until the present day. What strikes me about the settlement, is how relevant it is to the needs of today, in creating a lovely place to live, set in a sylvan setting, with ample community facilities for the benefit of all. It is a wonderful place to explore on foot, walking down tree lined avenues free from cars and observing modest crafted homes, set behind manicured low hedges. A somewhat idyllic place to engage the fusion of day to day living and nature. It is important to understand the place of New Earswick within the wider Garden City Movement, which was a broader attempt to reform living conditions for 'workers' as a whole. The Garden City Movement developed in the context of attempts to reform low-income inner city housing in order to improve conditions for the poor. The first attempts came from industrialists such as Titus Salt and the Lever brothers, who developed housing for their workers within walking distance of their factories. The aim of garden cities was to create an urban planning model designed to promote healthier communities in response to problems encountered by rapid urbanisation. The intention was also to create communities with a balanced approach to living conditions, industry, agriculture and recreation.

"", ""https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/like-a-boss/\nlike a boss Meaning & Origin | Slang by Dictionary.com libtard litty Examples Origin Usage Slang dictionary like a boss What does like a boss mean? To do something like a boss is to do it with stylish confidence or authority. This can be applied, tongue in cheek, even to fairly mundane tasks. Where does like a boss come from? Funny Or Die The word boss, borrowed from the Dutch, has been with American English language since the mid-1600s. Boss has long meant, and continues to mean, a 'person in charge,' especially used, of course, in professional contexts. Boss has also long been a slang term for 'excellent,' with evidence reaching back to the 1880s. Boss took off, though, as a youth slang term for 'superlative' and the like ('That new song is boss') in the 1960s. Ice Cube’s 1993 song 'Really Doe' may be one of the earliest recorded uses of the expression. On that track, Ice Cube raps: 'Out like a boss, with a half-pint of sauce / Got the shit sewed up like Betsy Ross.' Rappers Das EFX and Goodie Mob also used the line like a boss in 1995 and 1999 tracks, respectively. In 2001, Houston rapper, Slim Thug proclaimed 'I’m the boss, when I’m flossing my Boss like a boss,' (the Boss he’s flossing, or showing off, possibly refers to a car, the Boss Mustang) on a collaboration with fellow Houston rapper E.S.G. titled 'I’m the Boss.' Slim Thug went on to record a track called 'Like a Boss' in 2005, featuring the rapper listing all the things he does like a boss in a call-and-response style. This inspired a viral video and song by Saturday Night Live’s Andy Samberg, which greatly popularized the phrase. \x1b[102m[4] Andy Samberg’s comedy music group, The Lonely Island, parodied Slim Thug’s rap on their own song 'Like a Boss' in 2009\x1b[0m. The song was released on their album Incredibad in February, with a video starring Samberg and Seth Rogan which debuted on Saturday Night Live that April. In the video, Samberg plays an office manager receiving his review from a superior played by Rogan. Samberg begins by describing normal managerial duties, like calling his corporate office and approving memos (repeatedly interjected with like a boss), but then moves on to describing a failed attempt to hit on an employee, a downward spiral of self-destructive behaviors, and finally, absurd actions like turning into a jet and flying into the sun. \x1b[102m[5] Google searches for like a boss spiked in April 2009, showing a surge of interest in the phrase following the SNL sketch\x1b[0m. That June, a website, instantboss.org, that plays the like a boss refrain from the sketch, appeared. SEE MORE EXAMPLES Who uses like a boss? As a meme and hashtag or as a comment in everyday conversation, like a boss conveys a sense of confidence, pride, style, and skill in the way a person has performed some action, e.g. 'I wrote that term paper like a boss.' Echoing Samberg’s song, like a boss is often used as a humorous tag phrase: 'I did the laundry…like a boss.'

', ""New Earswick is a model village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire, England, near the River Foss, north of York and south of Haxby. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,812, reducing to 2,737 at the 2011 Census. The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority. History The village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, 'I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities'. The first 28 houses were designed between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new village. The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Hartrigg Oaks Complex The village had contemporaries such as Bournville, Saltaire, Port Sunlight and others. It presented a sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the 19th century, the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree's report of 1901, entitled Poverty: a study of town life. It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and insanitary housing. As a result of the report, Joseph Rowntree's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new 'garden' village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. "", 'Garden Village of New EarswickListenThe ‘garden village’ of New Earswick on the northern side of York influenced housing patterns in England and elsewhere for more than 60 years of the 20th century. It was built for Joseph Rowntree (1835-1925) the Quaker chocolate and cocoa manufacturer whose factory was nearby. Construction began in 1902 the year after the publication by Rowntree’s son, Seebohm Rowntree (1871-1954) of his social survey of York, Poverty: a study of town life. The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall. Many of the houses were built in cul-de-sacs which set an example that was copied by builders all over England in the 1920s and 30s. There are extensive open spaces and many trees. Bricks were made from local clay, and the site of the brickyard, which closed in the 1930s, is now a nature reserve.Enlarge mapShrink mapNavigateYour Location?Garden Village of New Earswick ', ""I have recently being doing some work at New Earswick in York, founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree and designed by the practice of Parker and Unwin. The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 and then over successive periods until the present day. What strikes me about the settlement, is how relevant it is to the needs of today, in creating a lovely place to live, set in a sylvan setting, with ample community facilities for the benefit of all. It is a wonderful place to explore on foot, walking down tree lined avenues free from cars and observing modest crafted homes, set behind manicured low hedges. A somewhat idyllic place to engage the fusion of day to day living and nature. It is important to understand the place of New Earswick within the wider Garden City Movement, which was a broader attempt to reform living conditions for 'workers' as a whole. The Garden City Movement developed in the context of attempts to reform low-income inner city housing in order to improve conditions for the poor. The first attempts came from industrialists such as Titus Salt and the Lever brothers, who developed housing for their workers within walking distance of their factories. The aim of garden cities was to create an urban planning model designed to promote healthier communities in response to problems encountered by rapid urbanisation. The intention was also to create communities with a balanced approach to living conditions, industry, agriculture and recreation.

91,10,"[""The Governor-General of India (1833 to 1950, from 1858 to 1947 the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, commonly shortened to Viceroy of India) was the representative of the monarch of the United Kingdom in their capacity as the Emperor/Empress of India and after Indian independence in 1947, the representative of the Monarch of India. The office was created in 1773, with the title of Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William. The officer had direct control only over his presidency but supervised other East India Company officials in India. Complete authority over all of British territory in the Indian subcontinent was granted in 1833, and the official came to be known as the 'Governor-General of India'. "", 'The title of Viceroy was abandoned when British India was partitioned into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan, but the office of governor-general continued to exist in each country separately until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956, respectively. Until 1858, the governor-general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, to whom he was responsible. Thereafter, he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British Government; the Secretary of State for India, a member of the British Cabinet, was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of their powers. After 1947, the sovereign continued to appoint the governor-general but thereafter did so on the advice of the government of the newly independent Dominion of India.

The office was created in 1773, with the title of Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William.

Until 1858, the governor-general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, to whom he was responsible. Thereafter, he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British Government; the Secretary of State for India, a member of the British Cabinet, was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of their powers.

It is spongy, about six to ten inches long, and is shaped like a flat pear or a fish extended horizontally across the abdomen. The wide part, called the head of the pancreas, is positioned toward the center of the abdomen. The head of the pancreas is located at the juncture where the stomach meets the first part of the small intestine. This is where the stomach empties partially digested food into the intestine, and the pancreas releases digestive enzymes into these contents. The central section of the pancreas is called the neck or body. The thin end is called the tail and extends to the left side. Several major blood vessels surround the pancreas, the superior mesenteric artery, the superior mesenteric vein, the portal vein and the celiac axis, supplying blood to the pancreas and other abdominal organs. ', ""In vertebrates, the gallbladder, also known as the cholecyst, is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine. In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and stores it. The bile is then released via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats. The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved – usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder (called a cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease. Structure The gallbladder is a hollow grey-blue organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the liver. In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 inches) in length and 4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter when fully distended. The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres (1.8 imperial fluid ounces). The gallbladder is shaped like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct. The gallbladder is divided into three sections: the fundus, body, and neck. The fundus is the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree. The gallbladder fossa, against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V. The cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct. At the junction of the neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct, there is an out-pouching of the gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as 'Hartmann's pouch'. "", 'The gallbladder develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. Early in development, the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. During the second week of embryogenesis, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. ', '15. Pancreas: 16. Accessory pancreatic duct, 17.

By Judson MacLaury On December 29, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed into law the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act, which gave the Federal Government the authority to set and enforce safety and health standards for most of the country's workers.1 This act was the result of a hard fought legislative battle which began in 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson unsuccessfully sought a similar measure. However, the roots of government regulation of workplace hazards date back to the late 19th century. State Factory Laws "", ""The labyrinth of State job safety and health legislation covered a wide range of workplace hazards but was badly flawed. There were too many holes in the piecemeal system and numerous hazards were left uncontrolled. The laws had to be amended often to cover new hazards. Many legislatures failed to provide adequate funds for enforcement. Inspectors, who were often political appointees, were not always given the legal right to enter workplaces. State with strong safety and health laws tended to lose industry to those with less stringent ones, which made States competitive and limited their legislative efforts. The Progressive Era and the growth of mass circulation newspapers and national magazines helped forge a national movement for workers' safety and health. In 1907, 362 coal miners were killed at Monongah, W. Va., in the worst U.S. mine disaster. This widely publicized tragedy shocked the Nation and led to the creation in 1910 of the U.S. Bureau of Mines to promote mine safety. That same year William B. Hard, a muckraking journalist, published an article in Everybody's Magazine titled, 'Making Steel and Killing Men,' based on his firsthand investigations of a Chicago mill.3 Hard estimated that every year, out of a work force of 10,000 workers, 1,200 were killed or seriously injured. He urged the steel industry to use its technical knowledge to reduce this casualty rate. U.S. Steel, spurred by mounting accident tolls, had already begun to collect accident statistics. Safety programs in subsidiaries dated back to the 1890's. In 1908, U.S. Steel formed a safety committee with instructions from the company president, Judge Elbert Gary, to cut the accident rate as much as possible. A highly successful 'safety first' movement developed from this which spilled over to other industries and led to the creation of the National Safety Council in 1915.4 "", ""Years before the Pittsburgh Survey, the idea of compensating injured workers from an insurance fund to which employers would contribute had gained a foothold in this country, though it was not at first promoted as a preventive measure.

In the United States, a few States tried to establish early compensation systems. Organized labor successfully opposed the concept, precisely because it was intended as a palliative, not a preventive measure. In 1908, Congress passed, with President Theodore Roosevelt's support, a limited workers' compensation law for Federal employees.

Music video Holloway Sanatorium steps, which feature in the video The music video for 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' was directed by Russell Mulcahy and was filmed at the Holloway Sanatorium, a large Victorian Gothic hospital near Virginia Water, Surrey, England. The surrealist video features Tyler clad in white, dreaming or fantasizing about students in a boys' boarding school. Young men are seen dancing and participating in various school activities and singing in a choir. The video received two nominations at the Billboard Video Music Awards in 1983 for Best Performance by a Female and Most Effective Use of Symbolism.

Due to the conditions during the beginning of World War II occupancy rates were drastically lower than normal. In January 1940, to ameliorate the situation the parties made an agreement in writing to reduce rent by half. However, neither party stipulated the period for which this reduced rental was to apply. Over the next five years, High Trees paid the reduced rate while the flats began to fill, and by 1945, the flats were back at full occupancy. Central London sued for payment of the full rental costs from June 1945 onward (i.e. for last two quarters of 1945). it was held by Denning J that; 'a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on'. Hence, central London property trust ltd will be estopped from claiming the full rent from 1940. since it made a promise to collect half price of the rent and the defendant believing so acted on the promise. "", 'High Trees House Ltd leased a block of flats in Battersea, London from Central London Property Trust Ltd. The agreement was made in 1937 and specified an annual ground rent of £2,500. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 led to a downturn in the rental market. High Trees struggled to find tenants for the property and approached Central London Property Trust in January 1940 to request that the rent be lowered. A reduction to £1,250 per year was agreed in writing, though the duration was not specified and no consideration was provided. By 1945, the building was returning to full occupancy. On 21 September 1945, Central London Property wrote to High Trees to request a return to the full rent of £2,500 and claiming arrears of £7,916 for the period since 1940. They then brought a test action to recover part of the debt for the two quarters which had elapsed since June 1945. Judgment Based on previous judgments as Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co, Denning J held that the full rent was payable from the time that the flats became fully occupied in mid-1945. However, he continued in an obiter statement that if Central London had tried to claim for the full rent from 1940 onwards, they would not have been able to. This was reasoned on the basis that if a party leads another party to believe that he will not enforce his strict legal rights, then the courts will prevent him from doing so at a later stage. Being obiter dicta and in a court of first instance this was doubly not a binding precedent, yet it essentially created the doctrine of promissory estoppel. ', 'The claimant let by deed a block a flats to the defendant for a term of 99 years in 1937. The rent was £2,500 a year. The subsequent chaos of WW2 meant that the defendant could only sublease some of the flats to tenants. This put them in danger of defaulting on the rent. The claimant told the defendant that they would reduce the rent to £1,250 a year to avoid this. In 1945, the claimant wrote to the defendant stating that rent would now be payable at the original rate. They also asked for back-payments covering the difference during the war period. The parties sought a declaration from the court as to what the defendant’s legal position was. Issue(s) Could the claimant insist on the defendant paying the full rent?Was the claimant entitled to back-payments? Decision ', ""By a lease under seal made on September 24, 1937, the plaintiffs, Central London Property Trust Ld., granted to the defendants, High Trees House Ld., a subsidiary of the plaintiff company, a tenancy of a block of flats for the term of ninety-nine years from September 29, 1937, at a ground rent of 2,500l. a year. The block of flats was a new one and had not been fully occupied at the beginning of the war owing to the absence of people from London. With war conditions prevailing, it was apparent to those responsible that the rent reserved under the lease could not be paid out of the profits of the flats and, accordingly, discussions took place between the directors of the two companies concerned, which were closely associated, and an arrangement was made between them which was put into writing. On January 3, 1940, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants in these terms, 'we confirm the arrangement made between us by which the ground rent should be reduced as from the commencement of the lease to 1,250l. per annum,' and on April 2, 1940, a confirmatory resolution to the same effect was passed by the plaintiff company.

"", 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London_Property_Trust_Ltd_v_High_Trees_House_Ltd\nHigh Trees House Ltd leased a block of flats in Battersea, London from Central London Property Trust Ltd. The agreement was made in 1937 and specified an annual ground rent of £2,500. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 led to a downturn in the rental market. High Trees struggled to find tenants for the property and approached Central London Property Trust in January 1940 to request that the rent be lowered. A reduction to £1,250 per year was agreed in writing, though the duration was not specified and no consideration was provided. By 1945, the building was returning to full occupancy. On 21 September 1945, Central London Property wrote to High Trees to request a return to the full rent of £2,500 and claiming arrears of £7,916 for the period since 1940. They then brought a test action to recover part of the debt for the two quarters which had elapsed since June 1945. Judgment Based on previous judgments as Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co, Denning J held that the full rent was payable from the time that the flats became fully occupied in mid-1945. However, he continued in an obiter statement that if Central London had tried to claim for the full rent from 1940 onwards, they would not have been able to. This was reasoned on the basis that if a party leads another party to believe that he will not enforce his strict legal rights, then the courts will prevent him from doing so at a later stage. Being obiter dicta and in a court of first instance this was doubly not a binding precedent, yet it essentially created the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

The rent was £2,500 a year. The subsequent chaos of WW2 meant that the defendant could only sublease some of the flats to tenants. This put them in danger of defaulting on the rent. The claimant told the defendant that they would reduce the rent to £1,250 a year to avoid this. In 1945, the claimant wrote to the defendant stating that rent would now be payable at the original rate. They also asked for back-payments covering the difference during the war period. The parties sought a declaration from the court as to what the defendant’s legal position was. Issue(s) Could the claimant insist on the defendant paying the full rent?Was the claimant entitled to back-payments? Decision ', ""https://vlex.co.uk/vid/central-london-property-trust-802942509\nBy a lease under seal made on September 24, 1937, the plaintiffs, Central London Property Trust Ld., granted to the defendants, High Trees House Ld., a subsidiary of the plaintiff company, a tenancy of a block of flats for the term of ninety-nine years from September 29, 1937, at a ground rent of 2,500l. a year. The block of flats was a new one and had not been fully occupied at the beginning of the war owing to the absence of people from London. With war conditions prevailing, it was apparent to those responsible that the rent reserved under the lease could not be paid out of the profits of the flats and, accordingly, discussions took place between the directors of the two companies concerned, which were closely associated, and an arrangement was made between them which was put into writing. On January 3, 1940, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants in these terms, 'we confirm the arrangement made between us by which the ground rent should be reduced as from the commencement of the lease to 1,250l. per annum,' and on April 2, 1940, a confirmatory resolution to the same effect was passed by the plaintiff company.

African American pilots (about 1,000 aviators) and civilians in supporting operational roles (more than 15,000 persons) were involved in the efforts. By the end of the war, the Tuskegee Airmen had completed 1,578 combat missions, and the airmen received some of the highest honors in the Army Air Corps. The 99th Fighter Squadron (formerly known as the 99th Pursuit Squadron) would combine with the 100th, 301st and 302nd to form the 332nd Fighter Group. In 1998 Congress established the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Site. This lesson’s purpose is to connect students to the history of the place and the voices of servicemembers who trained there. ']","[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen\nA group of 271 enlisted men began training in aircraft ground support trades at Chanute Field in March 1941 until they were transferred to bases in Alabama in July 1941. The skills being taught were so technical that setting up segregated classes was deemed impossible. This small number of enlisted men became the core of other black squadrons forming at Tuskegee Fields in Alabama. While the enlisted men were in training, five black youths were admitted to the Officers Training School (OTS) at Chanute Field as aviation cadets. Specifically, Elmer D. Jones, Dudley Stevenson, and James Johnson of Washington, DC; Nelson Brooks of Illinois, and William R. Thompson of Pittsburgh, PA successfully completed OTS and were commissioned as the first Black Army Air Corps Officers. In June 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was transferred to Tuskegee, Alabama, and remained the only black flying unit in the country, but did not yet have pilots. \x1b[95m[1] The famous airmen were actually trained at five airfields surrounding Tuskegee University (formerly Tuskegee Institute)--Griel, Kennedy, Moton, Shorter, and Tuskegee Army Air Fields\x1b[0m. The flying unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men and was backed by an entire service arm. On 19 July 1941, thirteen individuals made up the first class of aviation cadets (42-C) when they entered preflight training at Tuskegee Institute. After primary training at Moton Field, they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field, about 10 miles (16 km) to the west for conversion training onto operational types. Consequently, Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training (basic, advanced, and transition) at a single location. Initial planning called for 500 personnel in residence at a time. By mid-1942, over six times that many were stationed at Tuskegee, even though only two squadrons were training there. War Bonds poster featuring a Tuskegee Airman Tuskegee Army Airfield was similar to already-existing airfields reserved for training white pilots, such as Maxwell Field, only 40 miles (64 km) distant. African-American contractor McKissack and McKissack, Inc. was in charge of the contract. The company's 2,000 workmen, the Alabama Works Progress Administration, and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months. The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057. The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis Jr., one of only two black line officers then serving. During training, Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison. Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee. However, he was transferred on 12 January 1942, reputedly because of his insistence that his African-American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local white civilians. His successor, Colonel Frederick Kimble, then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield. Contrary to new Army regulations, Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama, a policy that was resented by the airmen. Later that year, the Air Corps replaced Kimble. His replacement had been the director of training at Tuskegee Army Airfield, Major Noel F. Parrish. Counter to the prevalent racism of the day, Parrish was fair and open-minded and petitioned Washington to allow the Tuskegee Airmen to serve in combat.

99,25,"[""Diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian, and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale. Eyes vary in their visual acuity, the range of wavelengths they can detect, their sensitivity in no light, their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects, and whether they can discriminate colours. History of research The human eye, showing the iris and pupil In 1802, philosopher William Paley called it a miracle of 'design.' In 1859, Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species, that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance 'absurd in the highest possible degree'. However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible: "", ""Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors. Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classic paper that only a few hundred thousand generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates. Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through. All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory. Rate of evolution The first possible fossils of eyes found to date are from the Ediacaran period (about 555 million years ago), while the oldest certain fossilized eye is from a Schmidtiellus reetae fossil from 530 mya, collected in Saviranna in northern Estonia. The structure is similar to the compound eyes of modern-day dragonflies and bees, but with (~100) ommatidia spaced further apart, and without a lens. The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the 'Cambrian explosion'. One of the many hypotheses for 'causes' of the Cambrian explosion is the 'Light Switch' theory of Andrew Parker: it holds that the evolution of advanced eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution. Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision. The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate because the fossil record, particularly of the lower Cambrian, is poor. How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells can evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation, relative advantage to the organism, and natural selection. However, the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year, which is common in small animals. Even with these pessimistic values, the vertebrate eye could still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years.[note 1] Origins of the eye Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye. All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development. This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light-sensitive machinery – even if it was not a dedicated optical organ. However, even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells. Probably, photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion. Higher-level similarities – such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses – reflect the co-option of a more fundamental protein to a new function within the eye. A shared trait common to all light-sensitive organs are opsins. Opsins belong to a family of photo-sensitive proteins and fall into nine groups, which already existed in the urbilaterian, the last common ancestor of all bilaterally symmetrical animals. Additionally, the genetic toolkit for positioning eyes is shared by all animals: The PAX6 gene controls where eyes develop in animals ranging from octopuses to mice and fruit flies. Such high-level genes are, by implication, much older than many of the structures that they control today; they must originally have served a different purpose, before they were co-opted for eye development. Eyes and other sensory organs probably evolved before the brain: There is no need for an information-processing organ (brain) before there is information to process. A living example are cubozoan jellyfish that possess eyes comparable to vertebrate and cephalopod camera eyes despite lacking a brain. Stages of evolution "", ""Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation. Vision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes. However, how this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism's environment varies widely: eyes have a wide range of structures and forms, all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules. At a cellular level, there appear to be two main types of eyes, one possessed by the protostomes (molluscs, annelid worms and arthropods), the other by the deuterostomes (chordates and echinoderms). "", ""The basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules bound to each other and located in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein; and a chromophore, the pigment that absorbs light. Groups of such cells are termed 'eyespots', and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings. Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species. The planarian has 'cup' eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction. These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup, which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions, then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened. While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light, as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo-sensitive cells regardless of its direction, the 'cup' shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light's angle. Pit eyes, which had arisen by the Cambrian period, were seen in ancient snails,[clarification needed] and are found in some snails and other invertebrates living today, such as planaria. Planaria can slightly differentiate the direction and intensity of light because of their cup-shaped, heavily pigmented retina cells, which shield the light-sensitive cells from exposure in all directions except for the single opening for the light. However, this proto-eye is still much more useful for detecting the absence or presence of light than its direction; this gradually changes as the eye's pit deepens and the number of photoreceptive cells grows, allowing for increasingly precise visual information. When a photon is absorbed by the chromophore, a chemical reaction causes the photon's energy to be transduced into electrical energy and relayed, in higher animals, to the nervous system. These photoreceptor cells form part of the retina, a thin layer of cells that relays visual information, including the light and day-length information needed by the circadian rhythm system, to the brain. However, some jellyfish, such as Cladonema (Cladonematidae), have elaborate eyes but no brain. Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain. During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction. The nautilus eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera.
