The gallbladder generally sits at the midline of the right (larger) lobe of the liver.\nMedical professionals can palpate the gallbladder when the patient is lying on the back or side. Without special knowledge, it's hard for the patient to locate the gallbladder even if it's enlarged.\nWhen to See a Doctor for Gallbladder Issues\n"", ""\x1b[92m[1] The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen (see Image.\x1b[0m The Gallbladder and Bile Ducts Laid Open). It measures approximately 7 cm to 10 cm in length and 4 cm in width. Even though the organ is small, it is a common cause of abdominal pain due to gallstones, which often require surgical removal of the organ. Anatomically, the gallbladder is located anteriorly on the undersurface of liver segments IV and V. There are many variants of the anatomy of the biliary system making exact knowledge of these anatomic possibilities crucial when performing gallbladder and biliary surgery. The gallbladder has an inferior peritoneal surface and a superior liver surface. It has no capsule however some authors describe an extension of the liver capsule (Glisson's capsule) covering the exposed surface of the body of the gallbladder. The gallbladder fundus is wide, and as it continues into the main body, it narrows in diameter. The gallbladder body tapers into the infundibulum, which then connects to the neck and cystic duct. At the distal portion of the gallbladder and into the cystic duct are spiral valves of Heister. These valves may be responsible to aide gallbladder emptying with neural and hormonal stimulation. In most people, there is an inferior outpouching of the gallbladder infundibulum or neck called Hartmann's Pouch. Occasionally there is a paucity located at the top of the gallbladder fundus. This is called a Phrygian cap and has no pathologic or surgical significance.\n"", 'In vertebrates, the gallbladder, also known as the cholecyst, is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine. In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. \x1b[92m[8] It receives bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and stores it.\x1b[0m The bile is then released via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats.\n', 'What Are GallstonesGallstones are small, hard deposits of cholesterol and bile salts that form inside the gallbladder or other parts of the biliary tract, disrupting normal bile flow. \x1b[92m[5] The gallbladder is a tiny organ on the right side of your abdomen, just below your liver.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[11] Its main role is to store and concentrate bile, a digestive liquid produced in the liver.\x1b[0m When gallstones are present in the gallbladder, it is called cholelithiasis. Meanwhile, choledocholithiasis develops when stones form in the common bile duct. Gallstones can form outside the gallbladder. The liver, pancreas, and surrounding bile ducts are other areas where gallstones are sometimes found.They range in size and number, and can cause complications if left untreated. For example, blocked bile ducts can lead to severe or life-threatening infection of the pancreas, liver, or the bile ducts themselves.\n', '20. Jejunum\n21–22. Right and left kidneys\nThe front border of the liver has been lifted up (brown arrow).\nThe main functions of the gallbladder are to store and concentrate bile, also called gall, needed for the digestion of fats in food. \x1b[92m[15] Produced by the liver, bile flows through small vessels into the larger hepatic ducts and ultimately through the cystic duct (parts of the biliary tree) into the gallbladder, where it is stored.\x1b[0m At any one time, 30 to 60 millilitres (1.0 to 2.0\xa0US\xa0fl\xa0oz) of bile is stored within the gallbladder.\n', ""which emulsifies and aids the breakdown of dietary fat. \x1b[92m[6] The gallbladder, a small hollow pouch that sits just under the right lobe of liver, stores and concentrates the bile produced by the liver, which is later excreted to the duodenum to help with digestion.\x1b[0m The liver's highly specialized tissue, consisting mostly of hepatocytes, regulates a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex organic molecules, many of which are necessary for normal vital functions. Estimates regarding the organ's total number of functions vary, but is generally cited as being around 500. For this reason, the liver has sometimes been described as the body's chemical factory.\n"", ""\x1b[92m[14] The gallbladder's main function is to store bile, a fluid that helps with digestion.\x1b[0m This muscular organ also concentrates and releases bile into the digestive system. When bile is needed, the gallbladder contracts, forcing the fluid through a tube called the cystic duct.\n\x1b[92m[7] The gallbladder is located just below the liver on the right side of the body.\x1b[0m Bile, which is also known as 'gall,' is produced in the liver and passed into the gallbladder for storage. This is where the gallbladder gets its name.\nGallbladder Function\nThere are several important functions of the gallbladder, which include:\nTo store and concentrate bile\nTo respond to intestinal hormones (such as cholecystokinin) to empty and refill its bile stores\nTo contribute to regulating the composition of bile (the percentage of water, bile salts and more)\nTo control the flow of bile into the small intestine\nTo contract, secreting bile into the biliary tract and duodenum (the first section of the small intestine)\nWhat Is Bile?\n"", ""The liver makes bile, which helps the body absorb fat.

It’s found below the stomach.\nEnzymes and bile travel through small pathways (called ducts) into the small intestine, where they help to break down food.\nUndigested food and some water travels to the large intestine through a muscular ring called the ileocecal (ill-ee-oh-SEE-kul) valve. This valve prevents food from returning to the small intestine. By the time food reaches the large intestine, the work of absorbing nutrients is nearly finished.\nThe large intestine: The large intestine's main job is to remove water from the undigested matter and form solid waste (poop) to be excreted. The large intestine includes three parts:\n"", 'The liver is a dark reddish brown, wedge-shaped organ with two lobes of unequal size and shape. A human liver normally weighs approximately 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) and has a width of about 15 centimetres (6 inches). There is considerable size variation between individuals, with the standard reference range for men being 970–1,860 grams (2.14–4.10\xa0lb) and for women 600–1,770\xa0g (1.32–3.90\xa0lb). It is both the heaviest internal organ and the largest gland in the human body. \x1b[92m[3] It is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity, resting just below the diaphragm, to the right of the stomach, and overlying the gallbladder.\x1b[0m\n', 'When gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it’s known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis.

The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it’s needed.\nWhat causes\xa0gallstones?\nGallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones.\n', 'Situated in the back of the nose where the nasal passages meet the mouth and throat, adenoids are similar to tonsils. They can also become inflamed, infected, and swollen. So when the tonsils are removed, the adenoids are generally removed at the same time. The combined procedure is called tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. As is true for the tonsils, other lymphoid tissue takes over when the adenoids are gone.\n\x1b[92m[0] Gallbladder\nThe gallbladder sits just under the liver in the upper right part of the abdomen.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[12] It stores bile made in the liver and releases it into the digestive tract when needed to help digest fatty foods.\x1b[0m The gallbladder may need to be removed (a cholecystectomy) if it becomes inflamed, a condition called cholecystitis. Most often this occurs due to infection or gallstones, which are a hardened collection of bile. In some cases, rest and antibiotics can control gallbladder inflammation so removal can be delayed or even avoided.\nUterus\n', ""The gallbladder is a small pear-shaped organ. \x1b[92m[9] It sits beneath the liver and stores bile until it is needed by the digestive system.\x1b[0m Bile is a greenish-yellow digestive fluid. It's produced by the liver to help in digesting fat.\nCancer occurs when cells in the body (in this case gallbladder cells) divide without control or order. Normally, cells divide in a regulated manner. If cells keep dividing uncontrollably when new cells are not needed, a mass of tissue forms, called a growth or tumor. The term cancer refers to malignant tumors. This means they can invade nearby tissue and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor means it won't spread.\nWho's at Risk for Gallbladder Cancer?\nA risk factor is something that increases your chance of getting a disease or condition. Risk factors include:\nSex: female\nHaving gallstones or chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, including calcification of the gallbladder (porcelain gallbladder)\n"", 'yellowing skin and eyes,\ndark or tea-colored urine, and\nlight or clay-colored bowel movements.\nWhat Is the Gallbladder?\nYour gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ. \x1b[92m[2] It is located in your upper right abdomen, below your liver.\x1b[0m The main job of your gallbladder is to store bile (also called gall), made by your liver. Bile helps your body digest fats and vitamins.\nEvery time you eat, your gallbladder releases bile. The bile then flows down into your small intestine through tubes called ducts. If something blocks the gallbladder duct or the ducts coming from the liver, you may feel pain in the middle or right side of your belly.\nGallstones are the top causes of gallbladder pain.\nWhat Are Gallstones or Gallbladder Stones?\nGallstones are hard particles that develop in the gallbladder.

The primary uses for lithium are in batteries, ceramics, glass, metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, and polymers (U.S. Geological Survey, 2019). \x1b[92m[2] Lithium has excellent electrical conductivity and low density (lithium metal will float on water), making it an ideal component for battery manufacturing.\x1b[0m Lithium is traded in three primary forms: mineral concentrates, mineral compounds (from brines), and refined metal (electrolysis from lithium chloride). Lithium mineralogy is diverse; it occurs in a variety of pegmatite minerals such as spodumene, lepidolite, amblygonite, and in the clay mineral hectorite. Current global production of lithium is dominated by pegmatite and closed-basin brine deposits, but there are significant resources in lithium-bearing clay minerals, oilfield brines, and geothermal brines (Bradley and others, 2017).\n', 'Late in the 20th century, lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid and 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon. \x1b[92m[1] Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, differ from lithium metal batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[0] Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.\x1b[0m\n', '\x1b[92m[4] The most important use of lithium is in rechargeable batteries for mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and electric vehicles.\x1b[0m Lithium is also used in some non-rechargeable batteries for things like heart pacemakers, toys and clocks.Lithium metal is made into alloys with aluminium and magnesium, improving their strength and making them lighter. A magnesium-lithium alloy is used for armour plating. Aluminium-lithium alloys are used in aircraft, bicycle frames and high-speed trains.Lithium oxide is used in special glasses and glass ceramics. Lithium chloride is one of the most hygroscopic materials known, and is used in air conditioning and industrial drying systems (as is lithium bromide). Lithium stearate is used as an all-purpose and high-temperature lubricant. Lithium carbonate is used in drugs to treat manic depression, although its action on the brain is still not fully understood. Lithium hydride is used as a means of storing hydrogen for use as a fuel.\nBiological role\n', '\x1b[92m[3] Lithium is a highly reactive metal that is used to make energy-dense rechargeable batteries for electronics, such as laptops, cell phones, electric vehicles, and grid storage.\x1b[0m Demand for lithium-ion batteries has grown significantly in recent years, driving global exploration, and enabling new lithium projects to be considered. Batteries accounted for 80% of total demand in 2022.\nAlso used in glass products, lithium increases the durability, corrosion resistance, and thermal resistance for use at extreme temperatures. It is used in such items as glass-ceramic stovetops, glass containers, specialty glass, and fibreglass. Because of its natural properties, lithium contributes to improved process productivity and energy savings in glassmaking.\nLithium is a critical mineral for the energy transition and net-zero emissions will require greater reliance on both new and recycled sources of lithium for batteries.\nLithium, global uses, 2022\nText version\n', '\x1b[92m[6] LithiumLithium is a very light alkali element that is a critical component in the manufacture of batteries for the automotive industry.\x1b[0m It is an essential and strategic raw material for meeting the challenge of the energy transition.

Early eyes[edit] The basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules bound to each other and located in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein; and a chromophore, the pigment that absorbs light. Groups of such cells are termed 'eyespots', and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. \x1b[92m[2] These eyespots permit animals to gain only a basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings\x1b[0m.[24] Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system.

According to evolutionary biologists, it would have taken less than half a million years for the most rudimentary eye to evolve into a complex 'camera' eye like ours.The first step is to evolve light-sensitive cells. This appears to be a trivial matter. Many single-celled organisms have eyespots made of light-sensitive pigments. \x1b[92m[3] Some can even swim towards or away from light. Such rudimentary light-sensing abilities confer an obvious survival advantage.\x1b[0mThe next step was for multicellular organisms to concentrate their light-sensitive cells into a single location.
