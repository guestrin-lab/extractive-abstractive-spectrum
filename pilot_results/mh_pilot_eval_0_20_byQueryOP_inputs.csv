The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries. In 2012, the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States, with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018. It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening. Adherents, often referred to as 'Latter-day Saints' or, less formally, 'Mormons', view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion. Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ, though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts: the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets. Because of some of the doctrinal differences, Catholic, Orthodox, and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity. Under the doctrine of continuing revelation, Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day 'prophet, seer, and revelator' and that Jesus Christ, under the direction of God the Father, leads the church by revealing his will to its president. Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives. The president heads a hierarchical structure with various levels reaching down to local congregations. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead local congregations. Male members, beginning in January of the year they reach age 12, may be ordained to the priesthood, provided they are living the standards of the church. Women are not ordained to the priesthood but do occupy leadership roles in some church organizations. Both men and women may serve as missionaries and the church maintains a large missionary program that proselytizes and conducts humanitarian services worldwide. Faithful members adhere to church laws of sexual purity, health, fasting, and Sabbath observance, and contribute ten percent of their income to the church in tithing. The church also teaches about sacred ordinances through which adherents make covenants with God, including baptism, confirmation, the sacrament (holy communion), priesthood ordination, endowment, and celestial marriage (marriage blessings which extend beyond mortality)—all of which are of great significance to church members.

The film went on to become a classic of the genre, and was described in 2010 by 'The Guardian' as 'one of the most influential films ever made.' Hooper subsequently directed the horror film 'Eaten Alive' (1977), followed by the 1979 miniseries 'Salem's Lot', an adaptation of the novel by Stephen King. Following this, Hooper signed on to direct 'The Funhouse' (1981), a major studio slasher film distributed by Universal Pictures. The following year, he directed the supernatural thriller 'Poltergeist', written and produced by Steven Spielberg. In the mid-1980s, Hooper directed two science fiction horror films: 'Lifeforce' (1985) and 'Invaders from Mars' (1986), followed by 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2' (1986), a big-budget sequel to his original film. The 1990s saw Hooper directing various horror and sci-fi projects, including 'Spontaneous Combustion' (1990), which he also co-wrote; the television anthology film 'Body Bags' (1993); and 'The Mangler' (1995), another adaptation of a Stephen King story. Hooper directed several projects throughout the 2000s, including the monster film 'Crocodile' (2000), an episode of the sci-fi miniseries 'Taken' (2002), and two episodes of 'Masters of Horror' (2005–2006). He died in 2017 at the age of 74 of natural causes.

Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial.

Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel.

9,51,Snippet,"[""Alexander  (1760 – 1780) was a Georgian royal prince ('batonishvili') of the Bagrationi dynasty of the Kingdom of Imereti and the only son of King Solomon I of Imereti by his second wife Mariam née Dadiani. In 1778, Alexander led a revolt against his own father, which gained support from many influential noble families, such as the Nizharadze, and the catholicos Maxim II Abashidze. Solomon emerged victorious, forcing many of the rebels into exile in the neighboring Georgian kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti, whose ruler Heraclius II had indicated sympathy to the attempted coup. Alexander eventually reconciled with Solomon, but died before his father, leaving the issue of succession unclear and open to rivaling claims, after Solomon's death in 1784, from Solomon's cousin David II, his nephew David (Solomon II), and George. The latter was Alexander's natural son of his marriage (1779) with Princess Darejan née Tsulukidze, which was not recognized as legitimate by the church. Alexander had no issue of his previous marriages with Salome, a daughter of Prince George of Georgia (the future king George XII; January 3, 1777), and with a daughter of Prince Paata Abashidze (1778). "", ""Solomon I, 'the Great',  (1735 – April 23, 1784), of the Bagrationi Dynasty, was King of Imereti (western Georgia) from 1752 to 1765 and again from 1767 until his death in 1784. Solomon was a son of Alexander V of Imereti by his second wife Tamar née Abashidze and succeeded upon his father's death in 1752. He immediately launched a series of stringent measures against the renegade nobles and slave trade from which they profited in conjunction with the Ottoman authorities. In 1752, the aristocratic opposition staged a coup, but Solomon quickly regained the crown and began a program of reforms aimed at stabilizing the kingdom torn apart by chronic civil wars. The Ottomans, which saw Imereti as the sphere of their influence, sent in an army, but Solomon succeeded in mobilizing his nobles around him and defeated the invaders at the Battle of Khresili in 1757. The same year, he forged an alliance with his kinsman, Heraclius II, who ruled in eastern Georgia. He defeated two more Ottoman invasions (20,000 strong and 13,000 strong). The Ottoman instigated invasion of North Caucasus tribes, one of which succeeded, while second one was thwarted. Briefly, Ottomans took Kutaisi in 1765 and placed his cousin, Teimuraz on the throne. In 1767, Solomon managed to stage a comeback, and freed Imereti of Turks again. Next year, another Russo-Turkish broke out, and in May 1769, Solomon traveled to Tbilisi to meet with Heraclius II.

The British Film Institute cited Hooper as one of the most influential horror filmmakers of all time. Born in Austin, Texas, Hooper's feature film debut was the independent 'Eggshells' (1969), which he co-wrote with Kim Henkel. The two reunited to co-write ' The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (1974), which Hooper also directed. The film went on to become a classic of the genre, and was described in 2010 by 'The Guardian' as 'one of the most influential films ever made.' Hooper subsequently directed the horror film 'Eaten Alive' (1977), followed by the 1979 miniseries 'Salem's Lot', an adaptation of the novel by Stephen King. Following this, Hooper signed on to direct 'The Funhouse' (1981), a major studio slasher film distributed by Universal Pictures. The following year, he directed the supernatural thriller 'Poltergeist', written and produced by Steven Spielberg. In the mid-1980s, Hooper directed two science fiction horror films: 'Lifeforce' (1985) and 'Invaders from Mars' (1986), followed by 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2' (1986), a big-budget sequel to his original film. The 1990s saw Hooper directing various horror and sci-fi projects, including 'Spontaneous Combustion' (1990), which he also co-wrote; the television anthology film 'Body Bags' (1993); and 'The Mangler' (1995), another adaptation of a Stephen King story. Hooper directed several projects throughout the 2000s, including the monster film 'Crocodile' (2000), an episode of the sci-fi miniseries 'Taken' (2002), and two episodes of 'Masters of Horror' (2005–2006). He died in 2017 at the age of 74 of natural causes.

15,47,Paraphrased,"[""The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often informally known as the LDS Church or Mormon Church, is a nontrinitarian, Christian restorationist church that considers itself to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries. In 2012, the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States, with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018. It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening. Adherents, often referred to as 'Latter-day Saints' or, less formally, 'Mormons', view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion. Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ, though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts: the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets. Because of some of the doctrinal differences, Catholic, Orthodox, and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity. Under the doctrine of continuing revelation, Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day 'prophet, seer, and revelator' and that Jesus Christ, under the direction of God the Father, leads the church by revealing his will to its president. Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives. The president heads a hierarchical structure with various levels reaching down to local congregations. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead local congregations. Male members, beginning in January of the year they reach age 12, may be ordained to the priesthood, provided they are living the standards of the church. Women are not ordained to the priesthood but do occupy leadership roles in some church organizations. Both men and women may serve as missionaries and the church maintains a large missionary program that proselytizes and conducts humanitarian services worldwide. Faithful members adhere to church laws of sexual purity, health, fasting, and Sabbath observance, and contribute ten percent of their income to the church in tithing. The church also teaches about sacred ordinances through which adherents make covenants with God, including baptism, confirmation, the sacrament (holy communion), priesthood ordination, endowment, and celestial marriage (marriage blessings which extend beyond mortality)—all of which are of great significance to church members.

The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries. In 2012, the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States, with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018. It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening. Adherents, often referred to as 'Latter-day Saints' or, less formally, 'Mormons', view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion. Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ, though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts: the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets. Because of some of the doctrinal differences, Catholic, Orthodox, and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity. Under the doctrine of continuing revelation, Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day 'prophet, seer, and revelator' and that Jesus Christ, under the direction of God the Father, leads the church by revealing his will to its president. Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives. The president heads a hierarchical structure with various levels reaching down to local congregations. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead local congregations. Male members, beginning in January of the year they reach age 12, may be ordained to the priesthood, provided they are living the standards of the church. Women are not ordained to the priesthood but do occupy leadership roles in some church organizations. Both men and women may serve as missionaries and the church maintains a large missionary program that proselytizes and conducts humanitarian services worldwide. Faithful members adhere to church laws of sexual purity, health, fasting, and Sabbath observance, and contribute ten percent of their income to the church in tithing. The church also teaches about sacred ordinances through which adherents make covenants with God, including baptism, confirmation, the sacrament (holy communion), priesthood ordination, endowment, and celestial marriage (marriage blessings which extend beyond mortality)—all of which are of great significance to church members.

His films contain overlapping continuity( i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores( typically composed by Michel Legrand) and motifs like teenaged love, labor rights, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality.

A guitar virtuoso known for his genre-crossing work, falsetto singing voice and flamboyant stage appearances, Prince is regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time. His innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk, rock, R&B, new wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop. Prince pioneered the late 1970s Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre drawing from synth-pop and new wave. Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song, 'Funk Machine', at the age of seven. He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album 'For You' in 1978. Followed with his next four albums — 'Prince' (1979), 'Dirty Mind' (1980), 'Controversy' (1981), and '1999' (1982)—Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released 'Purple Rain', the soundtrack album to his successful film debut of the same name. It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the 'Billboard' 200. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last to receive the award. Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album 'Sign o' the Times' (1987). He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros., Prince changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol , also known as the 'Love Symbol', and began releasing new albums at a faster rate in order to quickly meet a contractually required quota and therefore release himself from further obligations to the record label. He released five records between 1994 and 1996 before he signed with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as 'Prince' again. He subsequently released 16 albums, including 'Musicology' (2004), which was his most successful album of the 2000s. His final album, 'Hit n Run Phase Two', was first released on the Tidal streaming service in 2015. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Prince sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was also honored with special awards including the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Award for Achievement and of Merit, and the 'Billboard' Icon Award.

Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song, 'Funk Machine', at the age of seven. He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album 'For You' in 1978. Followed with his next four albums — 'Prince' (1979), 'Dirty Mind' (1980), 'Controversy' (1981), and '1999' (1982)—Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released 'Purple Rain', the soundtrack album to his successful film debut of the same name. It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the 'Billboard' 200. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last to receive the award. Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album 'Sign o' the Times' (1987). He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros., Prince changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol , also known as the 'Love Symbol', and began releasing new albums at a faster rate in order to quickly meet a contractually required quota and therefore release himself from further obligations to the record label. He released five records between 1994 and 1996 before he signed with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as 'Prince' again. He subsequently released 16 albums, including 'Musicology' (2004), which was his most successful album of the 2000s. His final album, 'Hit n Run Phase Two', was first released on the Tidal streaming service in 2015. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Prince sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was also honored with special awards including the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Award for Achievement and of Merit, and the 'Billboard' Icon Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016. 'Rolling Stone' ranked Prince at No. 27 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

It was number one in the UK in 1959 and 2005 as a double A side single. "", ""Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the 'King of Rock and Roll' or simply 'the King'. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

40,47,Abstractive,"[""The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often informally known as the LDS Church or Mormon Church, is a nontrinitarian, Christian restorationist church that considers itself to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries. In 2012, the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States, with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018. It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening. Adherents, often referred to as 'Latter-day Saints' or, less formally, 'Mormons', view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion. Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ, though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts: the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets. Because of some of the doctrinal differences, Catholic, Orthodox, and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity. Under the doctrine of continuing revelation, Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day 'prophet, seer, and revelator' and that Jesus Christ, under the direction of God the Father, leads the church by revealing his will to its president. Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives. The president heads a hierarchical structure with various levels reaching down to local congregations. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead local congregations. Male members, beginning in January of the year they reach age 12, may be ordained to the priesthood, provided they are living the standards of the church. Women are not ordained to the priesthood but do occupy leadership roles in some church organizations. Both men and women may serve as missionaries and the church maintains a large missionary program that proselytizes and conducts humanitarian services worldwide. Faithful members adhere to church laws of sexual purity, health, fasting, and Sabbath observance, and contribute ten percent of their income to the church in tithing. The church also teaches about sacred ordinances through which adherents make covenants with God, including baptism, confirmation, the sacrament (holy communion), priesthood ordination, endowment, and celestial marriage (marriage blessings which extend beyond mortality)—all of which are of great significance to church members.

45,51,Paraphrased,"[""Alexander  (1760 – 1780) was a Georgian royal prince ('batonishvili') of the Bagrationi dynasty of the Kingdom of Imereti and the only son of King Solomon I of Imereti by his second wife Mariam née Dadiani. In 1778, Alexander led a revolt against his own father, which gained support from many influential noble families, such as the Nizharadze, and the catholicos Maxim II Abashidze. Solomon emerged victorious, forcing many of the rebels into exile in the neighboring Georgian kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti, whose ruler Heraclius II had indicated sympathy to the attempted coup. Alexander eventually reconciled with Solomon, but died before his father, leaving the issue of succession unclear and open to rivaling claims, after Solomon's death in 1784, from Solomon's cousin David II, his nephew David (Solomon II), and George. The latter was Alexander's natural son of his marriage (1779) with Princess Darejan née Tsulukidze, which was not recognized as legitimate by the church. Alexander had no issue of his previous marriages with Salome, a daughter of Prince George of Georgia (the future king George XII; January 3, 1777), and with a daughter of Prince Paata Abashidze (1778). "", ""Solomon I, 'the Great',  (1735 – April 23, 1784), of the Bagrationi Dynasty, was King of Imereti (western Georgia) from 1752 to 1765 and again from 1767 until his death in 1784. Solomon was a son of Alexander V of Imereti by his second wife Tamar née Abashidze and succeeded upon his father's death in 1752. He immediately launched a series of stringent measures against the renegade nobles and slave trade from which they profited in conjunction with the Ottoman authorities. In 1752, the aristocratic opposition staged a coup, but Solomon quickly regained the crown and began a program of reforms aimed at stabilizing the kingdom torn apart by chronic civil wars. The Ottomans, which saw Imereti as the sphere of their influence, sent in an army, but Solomon succeeded in mobilizing his nobles around him and defeated the invaders at the Battle of Khresili in 1757. The same year, he forged an alliance with his kinsman, Heraclius II, who ruled in eastern Georgia. He defeated two more Ottoman invasions (20,000 strong and 13,000 strong). The Ottoman instigated invasion of North Caucasus tribes, one of which succeeded, while second one was thwarted. Briefly, Ottomans took Kutaisi in 1765 and placed his cousin, Teimuraz on the throne. In 1767, Solomon managed to stage a comeback, and freed Imereti of Turks again. Next year, another Russo-Turkish broke out, and in May 1769, Solomon traveled to Tbilisi to meet with Heraclius II. The two kings decided to request five Russian regiments and join the war with the Ottoman Empire in exchange of the guarantee that Georgian interests would be protected in the final Russo-Turkish peace deal.

In 1778, Alexander led a revolt against his own father, which gained support from many influential noble families, such as the Nizharadze, and the catholicos Maxim II Abashidze. Solomon emerged victorious, forcing many of the rebels into exile in the neighboring Georgian kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti, whose ruler Heraclius II had indicated sympathy to the attempted coup. Alexander eventually reconciled with Solomon, but died before his father, leaving the issue of succession unclear and open to rivaling claims, after Solomon's death in 1784, from Solomon's cousin David II, his nephew David (Solomon II), and George. The latter was Alexander's natural son of his marriage (1779) with Princess Darejan née Tsulukidze, which was not recognized as legitimate by the church. Alexander had no issue of his previous marriages with Salome, a daughter of Prince George of Georgia (the future king George XII; January 3, 1777), and with a daughter of Prince Paata Abashidze (1778).

Solomon was a son of Alexander V of Imereti by his second wife Tamar née Abashidze and succeeded upon his father's death in 1752. He immediately launched a series of stringent measures against the renegade nobles and slave trade from which they profited in conjunction with the Ottoman authorities. In 1752, the aristocratic opposition staged a coup, but Solomon quickly regained the crown and began a program of reforms aimed at stabilizing the kingdom torn apart by chronic civil wars. The Ottomans, which saw Imereti as the sphere of their influence, sent in an army, but Solomon succeeded in mobilizing his nobles around him and defeated the invaders at the Battle of Khresili in 1757. The same year, he forged an alliance with his kinsman, Heraclius II, who ruled in eastern Georgia. He defeated two more Ottoman invasions (20,000 strong and 13,000 strong). The Ottoman instigated invasion of North Caucasus tribes, one of which succeeded, while second one was thwarted. Briefly, Ottomans took Kutaisi in 1765 and placed his cousin, Teimuraz on the throne. In 1767, Solomon managed to stage a comeback, and freed Imereti of Turks again. Next year, another Russo-Turkish broke out, and in May 1769, Solomon traveled to Tbilisi to meet with Heraclius II. The two kings decided to request five Russian regiments and join the war with the Ottoman Empire in exchange of the guarantee that Georgian interests would be protected in the final Russo-Turkish peace deal.

"", ""Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, dancer, actor, and filmmaker. A guitar virtuoso known for his genre-crossing work, falsetto singing voice and flamboyant stage appearances, Prince is regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time. His innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk, rock, R&B, new wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop. Prince pioneered the late 1970s Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre drawing from synth-pop and new wave. Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song, 'Funk Machine', at the age of seven. He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album 'For You' in 1978. Followed with his next four albums — 'Prince' (1979), 'Dirty Mind' (1980), 'Controversy' (1981), and '1999' (1982)—Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released 'Purple Rain', the soundtrack album to his successful film debut of the same name. It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the 'Billboard' 200. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last to receive the award. Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album 'Sign o' the Times' (1987).

His innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk, rock, R&B, new wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop. Prince pioneered the late 1970s Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre drawing from synth-pop and new wave. Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song, 'Funk Machine', at the age of seven. He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album 'For You' in 1978. Followed with his next four albums — 'Prince' (1979), 'Dirty Mind' (1980), 'Controversy' (1981), and '1999' (1982)—Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released 'Purple Rain', the soundtrack album to his successful film debut of the same name. It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the 'Billboard' 200. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last to receive the award. Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album 'Sign o' the Times' (1987). He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros., Prince changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol , also known as the 'Love Symbol', and began releasing new albums at a faster rate in order to quickly meet a contractually required quota and therefore release himself from further obligations to the record label. He released five records between 1994 and 1996 before he signed with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as 'Prince' again. He subsequently released 16 albums, including 'Musicology' (2004), which was his most successful album of the 2000s. His final album, 'Hit n Run Phase Two', was first released on the Tidal streaming service in 2015. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Prince sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

He was also honored with special awards including the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Award for Achievement and of Merit, and the 'Billboard' Icon Award.

Major festival awards include Golden Lion at 69th Venice International Film Festival for' Pietà', Silver Lion for Best Director at 61st Venice International Film Festival for' 3- Iron', Silver bear for Best Director at 54th Berlin International Film Festival for' Samaria' and Un Certain Regard prize at 2011 Cannes Film Festival for' Arirang'.

Two of his films served as official submissions for Academy award for best foreign language film as South Korean entries. He has given scripts to several of his former assistant directors including Juhn Jai-hong(' Beautiful' and' Poongsan') and Jang Hoon(' Rough Cut'). "", ""Under the Cherry Moon\n\x1b[92m[3] Under the Cherry Moon is a 1986 American musical film directed by and starring Prince in his directorial debut\x1b[0m. The film also stars former The Time member Jerome Benton, Steven Berkoff, Kristin Scott Thomas( in her feature film debut), and Francesca Annis. The film was a critical and commercial failure, winning five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, tying with' Howard the Duck'. But, despite that, its soundtrack album, entitled' Parade', went platinum, selling over a million copies. "", ""Prince (musician)\n\x1b[1;31;60m[4] Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, dancer, actor, and filmmaker\x1b[0m. A guitar virtuoso known for his genre-crossing work, falsetto singing voice and flamboyant stage appearances, Prince is regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time. His innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk, rock, R&B, new wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop. Prince pioneered the late 1970s Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre drawing from synth-pop and new wave. Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song, 'Funk Machine', at the age of seven. He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album 'For You' in 1978. Followed with his next four albums — 'Prince' (1979), 'Dirty Mind' (1980), 'Controversy' (1981), and '1999' (1982)—Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released 'Purple Rain', the soundtrack album to his successful film debut of the same name. It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the 'Billboard' 200. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last to receive the award. Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album 'Sign o' the Times' (1987). He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros., Prince changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol , also known as the 'Love Symbol', and began releasing new albums at a faster rate in order to quickly meet a contractually required quota and therefore release himself from further obligations to the record label. He released five records between 1994 and 1996 before he signed with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as 'Prince' again. He subsequently released 16 albums, including 'Musicology' (2004), which was his most successful album of the 2000s. His final album, 'Hit n Run Phase Two', was first released on the Tidal streaming service in 2015. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Prince sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was also honored with special awards including the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Award for Achievement and of Merit, and the 'Billboard' Icon Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016. 'Rolling Stone' ranked Prince at No. 27 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries. In 2012, the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States, with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018. It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening. Adherents, often referred to as 'Latter-day Saints' or, less formally, 'Mormons', view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion. Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ, though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts: the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets. Because of some of the doctrinal differences, Catholic, Orthodox, and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity. Under the doctrine of continuing revelation, Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day 'prophet, seer, and revelator' and that Jesus Christ, under the direction of God the Father, leads the church by revealing his will to its president. Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives. The president heads a hierarchical structure with various levels reaching down to local congregations. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead local congregations. Male members, beginning in January of the year they reach age 12, may be ordained to the priesthood, provided they are living the standards of the church. Women are not ordained to the priesthood but do occupy leadership roles in some church organizations. Both men and women may serve as missionaries and the church maintains a large missionary program that proselytizes and conducts humanitarian services worldwide. Faithful members adhere to church laws of sexual purity, health, fasting, and Sabbath observance, and contribute ten percent of their income to the church in tithing. The church also teaches about sacred ordinances through which adherents make covenants with God, including baptism, confirmation, the sacrament (holy communion), priesthood ordination, endowment, and celestial marriage (marriage blessings which extend beyond mortality)—all of which are of great significance to church members.

The British Film Institute cited Hooper as one of the most influential horror filmmakers of all time. Born in Austin, Texas, Hooper's feature film debut was the independent 'Eggshells' (1969), which he co-wrote with Kim Henkel. The two reunited to co-write ' The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (1974), which Hooper also directed. The film went on to become a classic of the genre, and was described in 2010 by 'The Guardian' as 'one of the most influential films ever made.' Hooper subsequently directed the horror film 'Eaten Alive' (1977), followed by the 1979 miniseries 'Salem's Lot', an adaptation of the novel by Stephen King. Following this, Hooper signed on to direct 'The Funhouse' (1981), a major studio slasher film distributed by Universal Pictures. The following year, he directed the supernatural thriller 'Poltergeist', written and produced by Steven Spielberg. In the mid-1980s, Hooper directed two science fiction horror films: 'Lifeforce' (1985) and 'Invaders from Mars' (1986), followed by 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2' (1986), a big-budget sequel to his original film. The 1990s saw Hooper directing various horror and sci-fi projects, including 'Spontaneous Combustion' (1990), which he also co-wrote; the television anthology film 'Body Bags' (1993); and 'The Mangler' (1995), another adaptation of a Stephen King story. Hooper directed several projects throughout the 2000s, including the monster film 'Crocodile' (2000), an episode of the sci-fi miniseries 'Taken' (2002), and two episodes of 'Masters of Horror' (2005–2006).

A guitar virtuoso known for his genre-crossing work, falsetto singing voice and flamboyant stage appearances, Prince is regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time. His innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk, rock, R&B, new wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop. Prince pioneered the late 1970s Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre drawing from synth-pop and new wave. Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song, 'Funk Machine', at the age of seven. He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album 'For You' in 1978. Followed with his next four albums — 'Prince' (1979), 'Dirty Mind' (1980), 'Controversy' (1981), and '1999' (1982)—Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released 'Purple Rain', the soundtrack album to his successful film debut of the same name. It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the 'Billboard' 200. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last to receive the award. Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album 'Sign o' the Times' (1987). He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros., Prince changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol , also known as the 'Love Symbol', and began releasing new albums at a faster rate in order to quickly meet a contractually required quota and therefore release himself from further obligations to the record label. He released five records between 1994 and 1996 before he signed with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as 'Prince' again. He subsequently released 16 albums, including 'Musicology' (2004), which was his most successful album of the 2000s. His final album, 'Hit n Run Phase Two', was first released on the Tidal streaming service in 2015. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Prince sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was also honored with special awards including the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Award for Achievement and of Merit, and the 'Billboard' Icon Award.

Followed with his next four albums — 'Prince' (1979), 'Dirty Mind' (1980), 'Controversy' (1981), and '1999' (1982)—Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released 'Purple Rain', the soundtrack album to his successful film debut of the same name. It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the 'Billboard' 200. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last to receive the award. Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album 'Sign o' the Times' (1987). He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros., Prince changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol , also known as the 'Love Symbol', and began releasing new albums at a faster rate in order to quickly meet a contractually required quota and therefore release himself from further obligations to the record label. He released five records between 1994 and 1996 before he signed with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as 'Prince' again. He subsequently released 16 albums, including 'Musicology' (2004), which was his most successful album of the 2000s. His final album, 'Hit n Run Phase Two', was first released on the Tidal streaming service in 2015. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Prince sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was also honored with special awards including the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Award for Achievement and of Merit, and the 'Billboard' Icon Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016. 'Rolling Stone' ranked Prince at No. 27 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

"", ""Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the 'King of Rock and Roll' or simply 'the King'. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

In 1778, Alexander led a revolt against his own father, which gained support from many influential noble families, such as the Nizharadze, and the catholicos Maxim II Abashidze. Solomon emerged victorious, forcing many of the rebels into exile in the neighboring Georgian kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti, whose ruler Heraclius II had indicated sympathy to the attempted coup. Alexander eventually reconciled with Solomon, but died before his father, leaving the issue of succession unclear and open to rivaling claims, after Solomon's death in 1784, from Solomon's cousin David II, his nephew David (Solomon II), and George. The latter was Alexander's natural son of his marriage (1779) with Princess Darejan née Tsulukidze, which was not recognized as legitimate by the church. Alexander had no issue of his previous marriages with Salome, a daughter of Prince George of Georgia (the future king George XII; January 3, 1777), and with a daughter of Prince Paata Abashidze (1778). "", ""Solomon I, 'the Great',  (1735 – April 23, 1784), of the Bagrationi Dynasty, was King of Imereti (western Georgia) from 1752 to 1765 and again from 1767 until his death in 1784. Solomon was a son of Alexander V of Imereti by his second wife Tamar née Abashidze and succeeded upon his father's death in 1752. He immediately launched a series of stringent measures against the renegade nobles and slave trade from which they profited in conjunction with the Ottoman authorities. In 1752, the aristocratic opposition staged a coup, but Solomon quickly regained the crown and began a program of reforms aimed at stabilizing the kingdom torn apart by chronic civil wars. The Ottomans, which saw Imereti as the sphere of their influence, sent in an army, but Solomon succeeded in mobilizing his nobles around him and defeated the invaders at the Battle of Khresili in 1757. The same year, he forged an alliance with his kinsman, Heraclius II, who ruled in eastern Georgia. He defeated two more Ottoman invasions (20,000 strong and 13,000 strong). The Ottoman instigated invasion of North Caucasus tribes, one of which succeeded, while second one was thwarted. Briefly, Ottomans took Kutaisi in 1765 and placed his cousin, Teimuraz on the throne. In 1767, Solomon managed to stage a comeback, and freed Imereti of Turks again. Next year, another Russo-Turkish broke out, and in May 1769, Solomon traveled to Tbilisi to meet with Heraclius II. The two kings decided to request five Russian regiments and join the war with the Ottoman Empire in exchange of the guarantee that Georgian interests would be protected in the final Russo-Turkish peace deal. The Russians sent a small force under General Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben, but the general's rudeness and condescension alienated the Georgians; Totleben was quickly recalled from Georgia. After the war was over, Solomon was able to force his autonomist vassals, princes of Mingrelia and Guria, into submission, and continued antagonizing the Ottoman hegemony in the region. Ottomans had no choice but to sign a treaty with Imereti, by which Imeterti was no longer Ottoman vassal, slave trade was not even mentioned, with symbolic tribute of 60 women annually (did not stipulate them to be Georgians, and Solomon never honored this clause anyway). He crushed the Ottoman-sponsored insurrection in Abkhazia in 1779, and made a series of forays into the Turkish-controlled southwestern historic Georgian lands.

In 1778, Alexander led a revolt against his own father, which gained support from many influential noble families, such as the Nizharadze, and the catholicos Maxim II Abashidze. Solomon emerged victorious, forcing many of the rebels into exile in the neighboring Georgian kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti, whose ruler Heraclius II had indicated sympathy to the attempted coup. Alexander eventually reconciled with Solomon, but died before his father, leaving the issue of succession unclear and open to rivaling claims, after Solomon's death in 1784, from Solomon's cousin David II, his nephew David (Solomon II), and George. The latter was Alexander's natural son of his marriage (1779) with Princess Darejan née Tsulukidze, which was not recognized as legitimate by the church. Alexander had no issue of his previous marriages with Salome, a daughter of Prince George of Georgia (the future king George XII; January 3, 1777), and with a daughter of Prince Paata Abashidze (1778). "", ""Solomon I, 'the Great',  (1735 – April 23, 1784), of the Bagrationi Dynasty, was King of Imereti (western Georgia) from 1752 to 1765 and again from 1767 until his death in 1784. Solomon was a son of Alexander V of Imereti by his second wife Tamar née Abashidze and succeeded upon his father's death in 1752. He immediately launched a series of stringent measures against the renegade nobles and slave trade from which they profited in conjunction with the Ottoman authorities. In 1752, the aristocratic opposition staged a coup, but Solomon quickly regained the crown and began a program of reforms aimed at stabilizing the kingdom torn apart by chronic civil wars. The Ottomans, which saw Imereti as the sphere of their influence, sent in an army, but Solomon succeeded in mobilizing his nobles around him and defeated the invaders at the Battle of Khresili in 1757. The same year, he forged an alliance with his kinsman, Heraclius II, who ruled in eastern Georgia. He defeated two more Ottoman invasions (20,000 strong and 13,000 strong). The Ottoman instigated invasion of North Caucasus tribes, one of which succeeded, while second one was thwarted. Briefly, Ottomans took Kutaisi in 1765 and placed his cousin, Teimuraz on the throne. In 1767, Solomon managed to stage a comeback, and freed Imereti of Turks again. Next year, another Russo-Turkish broke out, and in May 1769, Solomon traveled to Tbilisi to meet with Heraclius II. The two kings decided to request five Russian regiments and join the war with the Ottoman Empire in exchange of the guarantee that Georgian interests would be protected in the final Russo-Turkish peace deal. The Russians sent a small force under General Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben, but the general's rudeness and condescension alienated the Georgians; Totleben was quickly recalled from Georgia. After the war was over, Solomon was able to force his autonomist vassals, princes of Mingrelia and Guria, into submission, and continued antagonizing the Ottoman hegemony in the region. Ottomans had no choice but to sign a treaty with Imereti, by which Imeterti was no longer Ottoman vassal, slave trade was not even mentioned, with symbolic tribute of 60 women annually (did not stipulate them to be Georgians, and Solomon never honored this clause anyway). He crushed the Ottoman-sponsored insurrection in Abkhazia in 1779, and made a series of forays into the Turkish-controlled southwestern historic Georgian lands.

In 1778, Alexander led a revolt against his own father, which gained support from many influential noble families, such as the Nizharadze, and the catholicos Maxim II Abashidze. Solomon emerged victorious, forcing many of the rebels into exile in the neighboring Georgian kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti, whose ruler Heraclius II had indicated sympathy to the attempted coup. Alexander eventually reconciled with Solomon, but died before his father, leaving the issue of succession unclear and open to rivaling claims, after Solomon's death in 1784, from Solomon's cousin David II, his nephew David (Solomon II), and George. The latter was Alexander's natural son of his marriage (1779) with Princess Darejan née Tsulukidze, which was not recognized as legitimate by the church.

Solomon was a son of Alexander V of Imereti by his second wife Tamar née Abashidze and succeeded upon his father's death in 1752. He immediately launched a series of stringent measures against the renegade nobles and slave trade from which they profited in conjunction with the Ottoman authorities. In 1752, the aristocratic opposition staged a coup, but Solomon quickly regained the crown and began a program of reforms aimed at stabilizing the kingdom torn apart by chronic civil wars. The Ottomans, which saw Imereti as the sphere of their influence, sent in an army, but Solomon succeeded in mobilizing his nobles around him and defeated the invaders at the Battle of Khresili in 1757. The same year, he forged an alliance with his kinsman, Heraclius II, who ruled in eastern Georgia. He defeated two more Ottoman invasions (20,000 strong and 13,000 strong). The Ottoman instigated invasion of North Caucasus tribes, one of which succeeded, while second one was thwarted. Briefly, Ottomans took Kutaisi in 1765 and placed his cousin, Teimuraz on the throne. In 1767, Solomon managed to stage a comeback, and freed Imereti of Turks again. Next year, another Russo-Turkish broke out, and in May 1769, Solomon traveled to Tbilisi to meet with Heraclius II. The two kings decided to request five Russian regiments and join the war with the Ottoman Empire in exchange of the guarantee that Georgian interests would be protected in the final Russo-Turkish peace deal. The Russians sent a small force under General Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben, but the general's rudeness and condescension alienated the Georgians; Totleben was quickly recalled from Georgia. After the war was over, Solomon was able to force his autonomist vassals, princes of Mingrelia and Guria, into submission, and continued antagonizing the Ottoman hegemony in the region. Ottomans had no choice but to sign a treaty with Imereti, by which Imeterti was no longer Ottoman vassal, slave trade was not even mentioned, with symbolic tribute of 60 women annually (did not stipulate them to be Georgians, and Solomon never honored this clause anyway). He crushed the Ottoman-sponsored insurrection in Abkhazia in 1779, and made a series of forays into the Turkish-controlled southwestern historic Georgian lands.

94,58,Abstractive,"[""'I Got Stung' is a 1958 song recorded by Elvis Presley and released as a single written by Aaron Schroeder and David Hill and published by Elvis Presley's company Gladys Music, Inc.. It was number one in the UK in 1959 and 2005 as a double A side single. "", ""Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the 'King of Rock and Roll' or simply 'the King'. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel', was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in 'Love Me Tender'. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special 'Elvis', which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 'Aloha from Hawaii'. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.
