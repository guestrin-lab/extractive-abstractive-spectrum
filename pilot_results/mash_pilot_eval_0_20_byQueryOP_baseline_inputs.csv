They may occur anywhere within the pancreatic gland. This video shows a laparoscopic pancreatectomy for insulinoma in a 52-year-old man with a BMI of 25.\nLaparoscopic pancreatectomy for insulinoma\nB Dallemagne, S Perretta, L Soler, J Marescaux\n13 years ago\n2.5K\n27\nSurgical intervention\n14:02\nAbstract\nLaparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy for a recurrent GIST\n', 'An insulinoma is a rare tumor of the pancreas. It\'s made of calls called beta islet cells, the same ones in the pancreas the make insulin and control your blood sugar. Normally, your pancreas makes more insulin when your blood sugar is high and less when your blood sugar is low. But an insulinoma constantly makes insulin, even when your blood sugar gets too low. You might hear an insulinoma called a ""neuroendocrine tumor"" because it starts in special cells in your body called neuroendocrine cells. These tumors are usually small (less than an inch), and almost all of them are not cancer. In most cases, surgery can cure them. Because insulomas make too much insulin, they can cause symptoms of low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia. You might have: Confusion Sweating Weakness Anxiety A fast heartbeat Headache Vision changes Personality changes Irritability Lack of muscle coordination Blurred vision Lethargy Seizure Hypoglycemia can be dangerous. If your blood sugar drops very low, you could faint or go into a coma. Hypoglycemia is common in people with diabetes. It often happens because they took too much of their medicine, missed a meal, or got more exercise than usual, all of which can lower blood sugar. An insulinoma can also cause hypoglycemia when you haven\'t eaten in a while, but it can happen at any time. It\'s not clear why some people get insulinomas. Women are slightly more likely to have them than men, and most people get them between ages 40 and 60. You\'re also more likely to have an insulinoma if you have certain genetic diseases, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: When tumors grow in glands that make hormones Von Hippel- Lindau syndrome: When tumors and cysts grow in many organs throughout the body Neurofibromatosis type 1 : Noncancerous tumors in the nerves and skin Tuberous sclerosis : Noncancerous tumors that grow in organs like your brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, and lungs It can be tough for doctors to diagnose an insulinoma. Its symptoms are the same as other common health problems. It may take time before your doctor can find it. You\'ll get tests like: Blood tests and suppression test. To find out if you have an insulinoma, your doctor will test your blood sugar, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during a 72-hour rest. This will confirm that: You have symptoms of low blood sugar, especially after not eating or heavy exercise Your blood sugar is actually low when you have those symptoms Your symptoms go away after your blood sugar goes up To do that, they will watch what happens to your blood sugar after you fast for a day to two. You may need to stay in the hospital during this time, and you won\'t be able to eat or drink anything except water. The doctor will test your blood to see if you have both low blood sugar and a high insulin level. Imaging test. You may also get an imaging test such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI so your doctor can see where the tumor is. The main treatment for an insulinoma is surgery to remove the tumor. Most of the time, that will cure you. The type of surgery you get depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Surgeons can usually remove just the insulinoma from the surface of the pancreas. Other times, the surgeon may need to remove part of the pancreas connected to the tumor. But this is less common. \x1b[92m[1] You might be able to have laparoscopic surgery to remove an insulinoma.\x1b[0m In this operation, doctors make several smaller cuts in your body instead of one large one. They use special instruments to do the surgery. That means you\'ll have less pain as you heal, stay fewer days in the hospital, and can return to normal life more quickly. Most people won\'t need any more treatment after surgery. If your doctor thinks surgery won\'t work for you, you can try other treatments to manage low blood sugar. You might take medicine and eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. Cancerous insulinomas are rare, and they need different treatment. If your doctor can\'t remove the whole tumor, you may need to take medicine to prevent low blood sugar. You may also need chemotherapy. Depending on the type of tumor you have, another treatment option is getting a radioactive medicine called lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( Lutathera). You get this medicine through an IV. This drug attaches itself to part of the tumor cell, and the radiation from the drug damages the cell.']",Can you get laparoscopic surgery for an insulinoma?,"Yes, laparoscopic surgery is a viable option for removing an insulinoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas that produces excess insulin [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m.

Diabetic neuropathy occurs when nerves in your legs and feet become damaged, which prevents you from feeling heat, cold, or pain. The problem with diabetic neuropathy is that a cut or sore on the foot may go unnoticed and the cut may eventually become infected. This condition is also a main cause of foot ulcers. Additionally, Peripheral vascular disease also affects blood flow in the body. Poor blood flow will cause sores and cuts to take longer to heal. \x1b[92m[4] Infections that don’t heal do to poor blood flow can potentially cause ulcers or gangrene.There are certain foot problems that are more commonly found in people with diabetes such as Athlete’s foot, calluses, corns, blisters, bunions, foot ulcers, ingrown toenails, and plantar warts.\x1b[0m These conditions can lead to infection and serious complications such as amputation.

Once a day, check your feet, too. Why? \x1b[92m[2] Diabetes can cause poor blood flow to your feet, so small cuts or sores don't heal as well, and they can take longer to recover.\x1b[0m If your blood sugar isn't well-controlled, you can also have poor or no feeling in your feet. You might not even realize you have a minor injury. Diabetes can also dry the skin on your feet and make your heels crack. The big risk is infection. Germs or fungus can get into small cuts or cracks. If you think you've gotten an infection, tell your doctor right away. Early treatment can prevent it from spreading. And that makes you more likely to avoid bigger problems. Some people with diabetes who get major infections even have to get surgery to remove part or all of an affected limb. So, check your feet carefully each day. Keep your skin clean and moisturized, avoid injuries, and protect your feet to prevent small cuts, corns, calluses, blisters, or injuries. Set a specific time each day to do this check. Use good light so you can spot any problems. If it's hard for you to lean over or see your foot, ask someone to help you. Look at your feet, toes, and heels for any cuts, sores, bruises, calluses, blisters, scrapes, scratches, or skin color changes. Check between your toes for cuts or fungus that might cause athlete's foot. Look at your toenails to spot any changes. Watch for dry, cracking skin on your feet, toes, and heels. Wear thick, soft socks to protect your feet as you walk. Don't use socks with seams that might rub against your skin and cause blisters. Wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes. Shoes that are too tight or too loose may lead to blisters. Don't go barefoot. You don't want to step on rocks, tacks, or small pieces of glass that could cut your feet. Wear slippers at home. Make sure the insides of your socks and shoes are clean and free from small pebbles or debris that could cut your feet. Keep your feet clean. Don't soak them for a long time. This can dry your skin. Dry your feet well after a shower or bath. Make sure you dry between your toes. After you bathe and towel your feet, moisturize your skin. Rub lotion or petroleum jelly into your skin and heels to keep them from drying and cracking. Don't put lotion or jelly between your toes, though -- this can lead to an infection. In winter, cold weather and central heating can dry out your skin. Take extra care to moisturize your feet and keep them warm. Wear socks to bed if you get cold. Don't let the corners of your toenails grow into the skin. This could cause an ingrown toenail. File your toenails with an emery board. You can also have a nail technician or your podiatrist trim and file them regularly. If you get pedicures at a nail salon, bring your own nail tools. Don't use anything sharp to clean under your toenails or to remove calluses. You don't want to accidentally get a cut that could let an infection set in. You can use a pumice stone to gently smooth your heels after taking a shower or bath. Don't rub too harshly. Exercise regularly to keep your blood flow healthy. Watch your blood sugar levels and follow your diet as your doctor directs. If you keep your blood sugar and weight under control, you may have fewer foot problems. Don't smoke. Smoking can narrow your blood vessels and raise your chance of getting foot problems. Also, note any cuts, scratches, scrapes, blisters, corns, or calluses, even if they're small. Let your doctor or podiatrist know in case you need medical treatment. Look for any redness, swelling, or drainage that could be a sign of an infection. If you think an infection is starting, get medical attention. Watch for foot sores called ulcers. They often develop on the balls of your feet or the bottoms of your toes. Tell your doctor if you think you have one. Nails that seem thicker, yellow, changed in shape, striped, or not growing normally could be a sign of an injury or infection. If your foot, ankle, or toe is swollen, red, hot to the touch, changed in shape or size, or hurts during normal movement, you may have a sprain or fracture. Call your doctor or seek medical treatment right away. Damage to your nerves, called diabetic neuropathy, can raise your chance of having a serious condition called Charcot foot, which causes a change in the shape of the foot. \x1b[92m[0] Call your doctor if you have minor foot problems like bunions, hammertoe, plantar warts, or athlete's foot, a fungal infection.\x1b[0m Treat these issues before they become more serious. If you spot a wart, corn, or callus on your foot, don't try to treat it yourself with over-the-counter pads or liquids. Don't try to cut it off your skin. Ask your podiatrist or doctor to remove it safely.""]","What should I do if I have diabetes and have minor foot problems like bunions, hammertoe, plantar warts, or athlete's foot?","If you have diabetes and encounter minor foot problems such as bunions, hammertoes, plantar warts, or athlete's foot, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional immediately [92m[0][0m.

A PET scan is a test used to give doctors and their patients more information about how the cells in the body are functioning. A PET scan is done by injecting a small amount of radioactive material (known as a tracer) into a patient's vein, usually in the arm. The tracer sends out small, positively charged particles (positrons) that interact with negatively charged particles (electrons) in your body. The PET scanner is able to detect the product of this interaction and uses it to make an image. The PET scan shows the brain's use of oxygen or sugar (glucose). For patients with epilepsy, a PET scan is used to localize the part of the brain that is causing the seizure activity. However, doctors may request a PET scan for many different reasons. Aside from potential problems in the brain and spinal cord, the test can also be used to diagnose heart problems as well as certain kinds of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, colon, and prostate cancers and lymphoma. \x1b[92m[6] Before undergoing the PET procedure, be sure to tell your doctor of any medication -- prescription or non-prescription -- that you are taking, along with any herbal drugs or supplements you may be using.\x1b[0m It is also very important that you tell the doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, since the PET scan can be harmful to an unborn child. As the test is about to begin, you will be asked to take off clothing that is covering the area of the body to be tested. Depending on the area of your body being tested, you may be asked to undress completely and put on a hospital gown. You will also be asked to remove any dentures, jewelry, or metal objects during the scan, because these items may affect the reading. A PET scan usually lasts 45-60 minutes. You will be asked to lie down on a flat table that is next to a scanner computer and a camera. You will then be given the tracer through an IV. After that, the PET scanner, a doughnut-shaped instrument, will move in circles around you. As this is happening, the camera will take pictures of patterns left by the tracer chemical inside your body. After the PET scan is finished, you will likely be asked to drink a lot of water or liquids during the next day in order to get rid of or flush the tracer chemical from your system. Because radiation is part of the test, there is a very small risk that cells or tissue may have received some damage following the PET procedure. However, the radiation levels from the tracer that is sent throughout the body are very low. In addition, following the scan, patients may find that their arm is a little bit sore or that they experience redness where the IV was placed in the arm. PET scans are usually more extensive and detailed than similar tests that are available. Despite this, test results can usually be given to the patient a day or two after the scan.""]",How do I prepare for a positron emission tomography (PET) scan?,"To prepare for a PET scan, follow your doctor's instructions closely, which may include fasting for a certain period, typically 4-6 hours before the scan, while you may be allowed to drink water [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m.

In fact, dogs bite about 4.7 million Americans every year, half of them children between ages 5 and 9. One out of every five of those bites causes an injury that requires medical attention, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Children are also more likely than adults to be injured by a dog bite. Although strays or other strange dogs can bite, most of the time people are actually bitten by a dog they know, which could be a friend's dog or even the family pet. To prevent dog bites: When choosing a dog for a family pet, pick one with a good temperament. Stay away from any dogs you don't know. Never leave young children alone with a dog -- especially an unfamiliar one. Don't try to play with any dog that is eating or feeding her puppies. Whenever you approach a dog, do so slowly,and give the dog the chance to approach you. If a dog becomes aggressive, do not run away or scream. Stay calm, move slowly, and don't make eye contact with the dog. \x1b[92m[5] Although you can provide first aid for a dog bite at home, it's very important to see a doctor, especially if an unfamiliar dog bit you, the bite is deep, you can't stop the bleeding, or there are any signs of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus).\x1b[0m Dog bites can cause infections that need to be treated with antibiotics. To care for a dog bite injury at home: Place a clean towel over the injury to stop any bleeding. Try to keep the injured area elevated. \x1b[92m[0] Wash the bite carefully with soap and water.\x1b[0m Apply a sterile bandage to the wound. Apply antibiotic ointment to the injury every day to prevent infection. When you visit the doctor, be prepared to answer a few questions, including: Do you know the owner of the dog? If so, is the dog up to date on all vaccinations, including rabies? Did the bite occur because the dog was provoked, or was the dog unprovoked? What health conditions do you have? People with diabetes, liver disease, illnesses that suppress the immune system, and other health conditions may be at greater risk for a more severe infection. Your doctor will examine the injury to see whether the bite was deep enough to damage muscles, tendons, nerves, or bones. Then the doctor will thoroughly clean the bite wound to remove any dirt or bacteria, and may also remove dead tissues from the wound. Sometimes, sutures are used to close a dog bite wound; however, this practice is controversial. Although suturing the injury can reduce scarring, it also can increase the risk of infection. Whether the injury is closed may depend on its location. For example, dog bites on the face may be sutured to prevent visible scars. Very deep wounds that cause a great deal of damage may require plastic surgery. Your doctor will also take measures to prevent infection. It's rare for dogs in the U. S. to have rabies, but if the dog's health status is unknown, or the dog tests positive for rabies, you will need to get a rabies vaccine. ( Bear in mind that the dog would have to be euthanized and their brain tested for rabies.) The doctor will also make sure that you are up to date on your tetanus shot. You may need to take antibiotics for seven to 14 days to prevent or treat an infection. The doctor may ask you to come back in one to three days to have the injury rechecked. If you did not know the dog that bit you, make sure to report the bite to your local animal control office or police.""]",How do you care for a dog bite ?,"To care for a dog bite, first, wash the wound with soap and water to remove saliva and debris [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m.

Be sure to have sunglasses, a hat, and comfortable lighting within easy access so that you can minimize the burden of photophobia.\n', 'Photophobia literally means ""fear of light."" If you have photophobia, you\'re not actually afraid of light, but you are very sensitive to it. The sun or bright indoor light can be uncomfortable, even painful. Photophobia isn\'t a condition -- it\'s a symptom of another problem. Migraine headaches, dry eyes, and swelling inside your eye are commonly linked to light sensitivity. It can cause pain whenever you\'re in bright sunlight or indoor light. You might want to blink or close your eyes. Some people also get headaches. Photophobia is linked to the connection between cells in your eyes that detect light and a nerve that goes to your head. Migraines are the most common cause of light sensitivity. Up to 80% of people who get them have photophobia along with their headaches. Many of those people are light sensitive even when they don\'t have a headache. Other types of headaches can cause photophobia, too. People who get tension and cluster headaches also say they\'re uncomfortable around bright light. \x1b[92m[4] A few brain conditions can cause photophobia, including: Meningitis (swelling of the protective coverings of your brain and spinal cord) Serious brain injury Supranuclear palsy (a brain disorder that causes problems with balance, walking, and eye movement) Tumors in your pituitary gland Some eye diseases cause this symptom, including: Dry eye Uveitis (swelling of the inside of your eye) Keratitis (swelling of your cornea, the clear layer that covers the colored part of your eye) Iritis (swelling of the colored ring around your pupil) Cataracts (cloudy coverings over the lenses of your eyes) Corneal abrasion (a scratch on your cornea) Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear tissue that sits over the white part of your eye) Damage to your retina, the light-sensitive layer in the back of your eye Blepharospasm (a condition that makes your eyelids close uncontrollably) Photophobia may also affect some people who have these mental health conditions: Agoraphobia (a fear of being in public places) Anxiety Bipolar disorder Depression Panic disorder You can also get photophobia after you have LASIK or other surgery to fix vision problems.\x1b[0m Certain wavelengths of light -- like the blue light your computer and smartphone give off -- cause the most sensitivity. Some medicines can also cause photophobia, including: Antibiotics, such as doxycycline and tetracycline. Furosemide ( Lasix): This keeps your body from holding on to too much fluid. It\'s used to treat congestive heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, and other conditions. Quinine ( Qualaquin): This is a drug used to treat malaria. \x1b[92m[3] If you think you have photophobia, see your eye doctor.\x1b[0m She\'ll ask about your symptoms and any medical conditions you have. Then she\'ll check the health of your eyes and possibly your brain. Tests your doctor might use include: Slit-lamp eye exam. She\'ll use a special microscope with a light to examine your eyes. MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of your eyes. Exam of the tear film. This checks the amount of tears you make to see if you have dry eyes. The best way to ease photophobia is to treat the condition or stop taking the medicine that\'s causing it. If you\'re still affected by it, tinted glasses may help. Some people have found relief from rose-colored lenses called FL-41. But tinted lenses aren\'t for everyone.

39,20,41,"['If you exhibit any symptoms of\xa0perimenopause, birth control\xa0pills may assist in alleviating them. As menopause approaches, estrogen levels will begin to decline. However, this decline will not be consistent, as estrogen levels fluctuate greatly during perimenopause. The birth control pill’s synthetic hormones conceal the normal decline in hormone levels that occurs in the years preceding menopause. Therefore, birth control pills may help alleviate some perimenopause symptoms.\n\x1b[92m[2] In addition to reducing the severity and frequency of irregular bleeding and hot flashes, birth control pills may also prevent bone density loss caused by the natural decline in estrogen levels.\x1b[0m In addition, birth control pills may reduce perimenopausal symptoms such as brain fog, anxiety, and depression.\nBest Birth Control for Perimenopause\n', '\x1b[92m[3] The hormones in birth control pills regulate your period.\x1b[0m While on the pill, most women will have their period on a regular schedule.

Eventually, your periods will stop altogether.\nBirth control pills can also help lessen PMS symptoms like period cramps, bloating, headaches, fatigue and mood swings.\nAre there any benefits to taking birth control pills during perimenopause or menopause?\nOral hormonal contraceptives like the pill are often the best birth control option for perimenopause symptoms.\nThe biggest benefit of taking birth control pills during perimenopause or menopause is that it keeps you from getting pregnant. You have a chance of getting pregnant as long as you’re still getting your period. Birth control pills are 99% effective at preventing pregnancy when taken as directed.\n', ""These are some frequently asked questions and answers about menopause to discuss with your doctor. While hot flashes (or flushes) are very common in perimenopause, not all women experience them, and not all flashes are of the same intensity. Hot flashes can be as mild as a light blush or severe enough to wake you from a sound sleep and be associated with perspiration (called night sweats). Most hot flashes last 30 seconds to five minutes. They usually disappear within a few years after menopause, but in some women they can continue for decades. You will know for sure that you have experienced menopause when you have not had your period for an entire year. Until you have gone one year without a period, you should still use birth control if you do not want to become pregnant. After menopause, you should continue to practice safe sex techniques by using latex condoms to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections. It is common in perimenopause to be given medications to regulate cycles and a common medication given is the lower dose birth control pill. \x1b[92m[0] Compared to regular birth control pills, the lower dose of estrogen in very-low-dose pills may be safer for perimenopausal women.\x1b[0m ( Perimenopause typically begins several years before your final period.) While regular birth control pills contain 30 to 50 micrograms of estrogen, these low-dose pills contain only 0.3 to 0.45 micrograms and can be increased as needed. \x1b[92m[1] In addition to preventing pregnancy, the pills can often regulate heavy or irregular menstrual periods and may provide protection from ovarian and uterine cancer.\x1b[0m The pills may also prevent bone loss, which can lead to osteoporosis. However, women with a history of breast cancer, blood clots, or heart disease, or women who smoke, should not take these pills. Hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) is designed to help women whose menopausal symptoms -- hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, mood swings, vaginal dryness -- are severe and affecting her quality of life. These symptoms can go on for years after your last period. HRT replaces or supplements the hormones your body doesn't make anymore. Most women who use it take a combination of estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen is what helps most with symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness; progesterone is added to protect against uterine cancer and bone loss (osteoporosis). While HRT relieves hot flashes for many women, there are other drug treatments that may offer relief. These include both over-the-counter and prescription therapies you may recognize for their more common medical uses. Over-the-counter therapies include various vitamins, ibuprofen products, and soy protein found in foods. Prescription treatments include: HRT Low-dose depression drugs fluoxetine ( Prozac), paroxetine ( Paxil), or venlafaxine ( Effexor) Clonidine, blood pressure medication Gabapentin, anti-seizure drug Brisdelle, a paroxetine formula specifically for hot flashes Duavee, a conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene formula designed to treat hot flashes Natural or bioidentical supplements containing compounds that act like estrogens -- such as soybeans or wild yams -- may provide some of the benefits of estrogen in relieving menopausal symptoms. They commonly include estradiol, estrone, estriol, progesterone, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA). These products are notregulated by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA and the dose of hormones can vary from batch to batch. Other botanicals, including black cohosh, have shown some promise for reducing menopausal sweats, or hot flashes. You should always check with your doctor before using any of these supplements. The pain you are experiencing during sex is may be due to vaginal dryness associated with declining estrogen levels during menopause. Talk to your doctor about possible causes of painful intercourse. There are a number of lubricants you can try to relieve the symptoms. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a suggestion. There are also local estrogen treatments -- cream, tablets, and an estrogen ring -- that treat vaginal dryness. A oral drug taken once a day, Osphena, is also available. The drug makes vaginal tissue thicker and less fragile, resulting in less pain for women during sex. The majority of women do not experience a voice change during menopause, although this may be a problem for some. Botanical supplements containing compounds that act like estrogens -- such as soy -- may provide some of the benefits of estrogen in relieving menopausal symptoms, but research results are contradictory.

21,1,21,"['\x1b[92m[0] Again, the benefits of the test should outweigh the risks of radiation exposure.\x1b[0m\nYou may also want to keep a medical imaging record to track your child’s history of imaging tests and share it with their health care providers. An English version for children can be found online at\xa0www.imagegently.org.\nHow much does the extra radiation increase a person’s cancer risk?\n\x1b[92m[1] Radiation exposure depends on the type of test done, the area of the body exposed, the person’s body size, age, and sex, and other factors.\x1b[0m\n', 'Radiation experts believe that if imaging tests do increase the risk of cancer, the increase in risk is likely to be very small. \x1b[92m[3] Still, it’s hard to know just how much radiation exposure from imaging tests might increase a person’s cancer risk.\x1b[0m Most studies on radiation and cancer risk have looked at people exposed to very high doses of radiation, such as uranium miners and atomic bomb survivors. The risk from low-level radiation exposure is not easy to calculate from these studies. We do know that children are more sensitive to radiation and should be protected from it as much as possible.\n', 'If you have concerns about the radiation you may get from a CT scan, PET scan, or any other imaging test that uses radiation, talk to your health care provider. \x1b[92m[2] Ask whether the test is needed and if it’s the best one to use in your case.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[5] You may also want to know what you and your health care provider can expect to learn from it.\x1b[0m\nThe best advice at this time is to get only the imaging tests that are needed and try to limit your exposure to all forms of radiation. If you do need to have a test that will expose you to some radiation, ask if there are ways to shield the parts of your body that aren’t being imaged. For example, a lead apron can be used to protect parts of your chest or abdomen from getting radiation, and a lead collar (known as a thyroid shield or thyroid collar) can be used to protect your thyroid gland.\n', ""A computed tomography ( CT) scan is a test your doctor might use to look for a problem inside your body, plan your surgery, or check how well a treatment is working for you. It uses powerful X-rays, a form of radiation, to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Some people worry about getting this test because radiation is known as a possible cause of cancer. Know that the chances of getting cancer from a CT scan are very low. \x1b[92m[4] And for many people, the test is worth the small risk of radiation exposure.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[6] It can help doctors spot dangerous health problems and check that treatment works.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[7] Your doctor will make sure that the benefits you'd get from the scan outweigh the drawbacks before she recommends it for you.\x1b[0m CT scans use X-rays, which are a type of radiation called ionizing radiation. It can damage the DNA in your cells and raise the chance that they'll turn cancerous. These scans expose you to more radiation than other imaging tests, like X-rays and mammograms. For example, one chest CT scan delivers the amount in 100 to 200 X-rays. That might sound like a lot, but the total amount you get is still very small. It's important to know that everyone is exposed to ionizing radiation every day, just from natural radioactive material in their surroundings. In a year, the average person gets about 3 millisieverts (m Sv), the units that scientists use to measure radiation. Each CT scan delivers 1 to 10 m Sv, depending on the dose of radiation and the part of your body that's getting the test. A low-dose chest CT scan is about 1.5 m Sv. The same test at a regular dose is about 7 m Sv. The more CT scans you have, the more radiation exposure you get. But that shouldn't stop you from getting them if your doctor says you need them. What are the chances that the X-rays from a scan will end up causing a problem? It depends on your age, gender, and the part of your body that's being scanned. Overall, your odds are very low -- the chance of getting a fatal cancer from any one CT scan is about 1 in 2,000. Some organs are more sensitive to radiation than others. It tends to do more damage to cells that grow and divide quickly. The breasts, lungs, thyroid gland, and bone marrow all have fast-dividing cells, so they are more sensitive than other body parts, like the brain. The possibility of cancer is slightly higher in women than in men. It's also higher in kids, because they're growing and their cells are dividing faster than those in adults. Children also have more years ahead of them in which they could get cancer from radiation. You don't need to stop getting CT scans. But it's a good idea to make sure you need each one you get. Before you have any imaging test, ask your doctor these questions: Why do I need this scan? How will it affect my treatment? What are the risks? Could you diagnose me with a test that doesn't use radiation, like an MRI or an ultrasound? How will you protect the rest of my body during the CT scan? Your doctor should use the smallest possible dose of radiation to do the scan -- especially if you need to have several of them. Ask if the technician can shield the parts of your body that don't need the test with a lead apron. This will block the X-rays from entering those areas. Keep a record of the CT scans and other X-rays you have, so you'll know how much radiation you're getting. It will also prevent you from repeating a test you've already done. Write down: The type of scan The date you had it The dose of radiation you got The name of the facility where you had the test If you're still concerned about radiation from a CT scan, you can always get a second opinion. Another doctor might be able to recommend other testing options.""]",What questions should I ask if I'm concerned about getting a CT scan?,"If you're concerned about getting a CT scan, it's important to ask your healthcare provider several key questions.

33,14,34,"[""Babies' lungs are still developing and their brains are still trying to figure out how to send messages to the lungs to remind them to breathe.

But may also indicate chronic lung diseases or respiratory problems.\nStridor: It is a constant, high-pitched sound that may be caused due to an obstruction in the airways.\nGrunting: A sudden, low-pitched noise while exhaling may be due to a problem with one or both lungs of your newborn. It may also be caused due to an infection and demands prompt treatment by your paediatrician.\nIs Your Baby at Risk of Developing Breathing Disorders?\nPremature delivery is the primary cause of infant breathing disorders.

If a baby’s blood oxygen level dips, the lips may appear bluish in color.\nWhen to See a Doctor\nWhether your child has RSV or some other infection, do not hesitate to seek help. \x1b[92m[11] 'Parents’ instincts are usually pretty good,' says Dr. Chopra, so if you are worried, trust your gut and call your pediatrician.\x1b[0m Sometimes a doctor can provide help over the phone or by a video doctor visit. Other times they want to see your child in person.\nA baby who isn’t eating or drinking as usual and produces fewer wet diapers than usual may be getting dehydrated, observes Dr. Chopra. In that case, says Dr. Chopra, it’s time to visit the pediatrician’s office for evaluation.\n"", 'Newborns tend to have an irregular breathing pattern that alternates between fast and slow, with occasional pauses. If your baby makes noises when breathing, take note of what they sound like. This will help determine if there is a problem in the breathing passages and where: Whistling noise: A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths. This is a good trick, as it allows them to breathe and eat at the same time. However, their little noses have small air passages, so a little bit of mucus or dried milk can make the breathing passage even smaller, causing a whistling noise or occasionally, difficulty moving the air in and out. Hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough: A blockage in the larynx (windpipe), often due to mucus, makes a hoarse cry and a ""barking"" cough. This may be a sign of croup, an infection of the larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes. High-pitched, squeaky sound: Called stridor or laryngomalacia, this is a sound very young babies make when breathing in. It is worse when a child is lying on his or her back. It is caused by excess tissue around the larynx and is typically harmless. It typically passes by the time a child reaches age 2. Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on). Fast, labored breathing: Fluid in the smallest airways (the ""alveoli"") causes pneumonia, an infection due to a virus or bacteria. Pneumonia causes fast, labored breathing, occasionally cyanosis, a persistent cough, and crackly sounds (""rales"") when listened to with a stethoscope. Watch your baby\'s breathing when she\'s well, so you can get used to how it looks. Time how many breaths she takes in a minute. It\'s probably faster than you imagined. Knowing what\'s normal for your baby\'s breathing will help you spot a potential problem more quickly. When in doubt of what\'s going on, make a video of the breathing pattern that is worrying you to show to your baby\'s health care provider. \x1b[92m[1] Signs of potentially worrisome breathing problems in your baby include: Persistently increased rate of breathing (greater than 60 breaths per minute or so) Increased work to breathe.\x1b[0m Signs of this include: Grunting. The baby makes a little grunting noise at the end of respiration. This serves to try to open up blocked airways. Flaring. The baby\'s nostrils flare during breathing, showing increased effort. Retractions. The muscles in the baby\'s chest (under the ribs) and neck are visibly seen going in and out much more deeply than usual. Cyanosis. This means the blood has remained blue and has not gotten sufficient oxygen from the lungs (such as with pneumonia). For true cyanosis, the blood all over the body should look blue. Check areas that get a lot of blood flow, such as the lips and the tongue. Sometimes, the hands and feet of newborns turn bluish, but the rest of the body is fine. This is not cyanosis but a common response to changes in temperature. Poor feeding. "" Respiratory distress"" is often accompanied by a noticeable decrease in feeding intake. Lethargy. Your baby\'s energy level may be markedly decreased if she has a significant lung problem. Fever. Most infections of the lung will cause a fever, as well. Always check your baby\'s temperature when you are concerned. Breathing problems (such as noisy breathing) that only occur occasionally are normal. Worrisome breathing problems, on the other hand, are usually persistent.

Although scientists are still not completely sure why we have earwax, it does trap dust and other small particles and prevent them from reaching, and potentially damaging or infecting the eardrum. Normally, the wax dries up and falls out of the ear, along with any trapped dust or debris. Everyone makes ear wax, but the amount and type are genetically determined just like hair color or height. Smaller or oddly shaped ear canals may make it difficult for the naturally occurring wax to get out of the canal and lead to wax impactions. Blockage, or impaction, also occurs when the wax gets pushed deep within the ear canal. Earwax blockage is one of the most common ear problems doctors see. \x1b[92m[3] The most common cause of impactions is the use of Q-tips (and other objects such as bobby pins and rolled napkin corners), which can remove superficial wax but also pushes the rest of the wax deeper into the ear canal.\x1b[0m Hearing aid and earplug users are also more prone to earwax blockage. Symptoms of an earwax impaction include: Decreased hearing Dizziness Ear pain Plugged or fullness sensation Ringing in the ear Itching or drainage from the ear canal See your doctor if you think you may have any symptoms of an earwax impaction. Other conditions may cause these symptoms and it is important to be sure earwax is the culprit before trying any home remedies. Go to the hospital if: You have a severe spinning sensation, loss of balance, or inability to walk You have persistent vomiting or high fever You experience sudden loss of hearing A doctor can diagnose earwax blockage (or eardrum perforation) by listening to your symptoms and then looking into your ear with an otoscope (ear-scope). Your doctor may recommend that you try an earwax removal method at home, unless you have a perforation (hole) or a tube in your eardrum. \x1b[92m[13] Over-the-counter wax softening drops such as Debrox or Murine may be put into the affected ear and then allowed to drain out after about five minutes while holding the head to the side, allowing the drops to settle.\x1b[0m Sitting up again will let the drops drain out by themselves. A bulb-type syringe may be used to gently flush the ear with warm water. The water should be at body temperature to help prevent dizziness. Ear candling is not recommended. The procedure uses a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth on the tapered end. The tapered end is placed inside the ear, and an assistant lights the other end, while making sure your hair does not catch on fire. In theory, as the flame burns, a vacuum is created, which draws the wax out of the ear. Limited clinical trials, however, showed that no vacuum was created, and no wax was removed. Furthermore, this practice may result in serious injury. The doctor may remove your earwax with a small plastic spoon called a curette, or irrigate your ear with warmed water, sodium bicarbonate, or other prescription-strength eardrops. The doctor may also use gentle suction to remove the wax. \x1b[92m[0] Earwax blockage can often be prevented by avoiding the use of cotton-tipped swabs or Q-tips and other objects that push the wax deeper into the ear canal.\x1b[0m Complications of earwax blockages include: Perforated eardrum Middle-ear infection External-ear infection (swimmer's ear ) Permanent hearing loss from acoustic trauma""]",How can you prevent earwax blockage?,"To prevent earwax blockage, it's essential to avoid inserting objects into your ears, such as cotton swabs, which can push wax deeper [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m[92m[6][0m[92m[7][0m[92m[8][0m[92m[9][0m.

In fact, many couples have gone years without transmitting the virus to their partner. To keep yourself safe, the correct preventative measures need to be taken to protect against infection. These measures include:\nAvoid all forms of sexual contact if your partner has an active outbreak (i.e. open sores, or a tingling sensation around the genital region.\nSimilarly, avoid sharing sex toys unless they are washed thoroughly between uses.\n\x1b[92m[2] Always wear a condom when having sex, but be aware that this won’t offer enough protection as the virus can be present in areas that aren’t protected by the condom.\x1b[0m\nConsider daily suppressive antiviral treatment, such as Aciclovir, for your partner.

Herpes outbreaks are not always obvious and your partner may be contagious without you knowing it. \x1b[92m[3] Anyone involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with a partner infected with HSV-2 should get counseling from a health care practitioner on how to stay safe.Avoid touching the sores.Use or have your partner use a latex condom, even when sores are not visible.Limit the number of sex partners.Use a water-based lubricant to prevent friction during sex, which can irritate the skin and increase the risk of outbreaks.\x1b[0m\nTreatment Approach\n', ""A latex condom may protect you from the herpes virus if it covers the infected area. Most people who have genital herpes don't know they're infected, so ask whether he or she has had any other sexually transmitted disease. People with a history of STDs are more likely to have genital herpes. It may be awkward, but it's important to be honest with each other. Your partner may be afraid to tell you the truth if he or she fears a negative reaction. If your partner feels comfortable talking with you, you'll be more likely to get straight answers. Someone who has had many sexual partners is more likely to be infected with the herpes virus. The fewer sexual partners you have in your lifetime, the less likely you are to be exposed to the herpes virus. If you know your partner has genital herpes, always abstain from sex when symptoms are present. Or, if you see a sore on someone's genitals, don't have sex with that person until you're sure he or she doesn't have genital herpes. Remember, not everyone with genital herpes has symptoms, and herpes sores can be very hard to spot. Oral herpes, which causes sores on the mouth (known as cold sores of fever blisters), can be passed to the genitals through oral sex. If you think your partner is at high risk for genital herpes, you may consider asking him or her to be tested. In that case, you should be tested, too. Alcohol and illicit drugs lower inhibitions and impair judgment. People tend to be less careful about practicing safer sex while intoxicated and they often regret it later. \x1b[92m[0] The only way to be 100% certain you won't get a sexually transmitted disease is to have just one sex partner who has no STDs -- and only if both of you stay monogamous.\x1b[0m If you don't want to be monogamous or totally celibate until you find a life partner, you could greatly reduce the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease by doing things that don't involve genital-genital contact or oral-genital contact, such as mutual masturbation.""]",How can I be sure not to get genital herpes?,"To significantly reduce the risk of getting genital herpes, engage in sexual activities only with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m.

It also lists some of the common brands and explains how you can make your own at home.\nBurger / Getty Images\nWhat Are Saline Nasal Sprays?\nSaline nasal sprays are small spray bottles that contain saline—a mixture of sodium chloride (salt) and sterilized water.\nThe saline solution used in nasal sprays is isotonic, meaning that it is the same saline concentration as that which is naturally found in the human body.\n', 'Overusing decongestant nasal sprays can lead to rebound congestion in which your nasal congestion gets worse rather than better. For this reason, decongestant nasal sprays should not be used for longer than three days.\nRebound congestion is not associated with antihistamine, steroid, or cromolyn nasal sprays, but there are side effects and complications associated with the overuse of these products. \x1b[92m[4] Speak with your healthcare provider before using any medicated spray to treat a nasal condition.\x1b[0m\nHow to Make Your Own Saline Nasal Spray\nYou can make your own saline nasal spray at home with salt and tap water.

As mentioned above, inserting the tip in the wrong direction could injure your nose. If you experience a nosebleed, you should contact your doctor to ensure you're using the product correctly. Additionally, the solution should not drip down your nose or the back of your throat. However, some nasal sprays can leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth. If you experience this, try taking a sip of water or juice to diminish the aftertaste.\n\x1b[92m[1] A rebound effect can occur if you use over-the-counter nasal decongestants regularly.\x1b[0m After a few days of using this type of nasal spray, your nose may become less responsive to the medication. As a result, you may need to use more of it to control your congestion. Your congestion may also worsen if you stop using the medication. Some people may mistake this rebound effect for addiction, but it isn't.\nChoosing the right nasal spray for your condition\n"", 'Most cold and flu drugs attack symptoms, not the specific viruses. They aren\'t a cure, but they can ease your symptoms or shorten your illness. There\'s no one right way to treat a cold or the flu. But here are some questions to ask your pharmacist to get the right over-the-counter medication for you. This depends on your symptoms. If you have nasal or sinus congestion, then a decongestant can be helpful. If you have drainage -- either a runny nose or postnasal drip or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine may be helpful. Over-the-counter antihistamines often make people drowsy; decongestants can make people hyper or keep them awake. Antihistamines can make secretions thick, which can be a problem for people with asthma. Keep in mind that both these medications may interact with other drugs you may be taking for conditions such as heart disease, and they may worsen some conditions. Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist which cold medication may be best for you. Decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate, and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Pseudoephedrine is the primary oral decongestant available. In general, if your blood pressure is well controlled with medications, then a decongestant shouldn\'t be a problem as long as you monitor your blood pressure. This may not be true with certain types of blood pressure drugs. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about what may be best for you. Nasal decongestants work fast to open breathing passages. But if you use them for more than three days in a row, you may suffer a ""rebound effect,"" and end up more congested than you were at the start. Some doctors suggest using a saline spray instead of a medicated spray. Saline spray works more slowly but has no rebound effect. An occasional cough may clear the lung of pollutants and excess phlegm and probably shouldn\'t be treated. However, a persistent cough should be diagnosed and treated specifically. On the shelf you\'ll find numerous cough medicines with various combinations of decongestants, antihistamines, analgesics/antipyretics, cough suppressants, and expectorants. Ask your pharmacist which combination, if any, would be right for you. Fever may be a good thing. It helps the body fight off infection by suppressing the growth of bacteria and viruses and activating the immune system. Doctors no longer recommend suppressing fever for most people, except perhaps for the very young, the very old, and those with certain medical conditions such as heart disease or lung disease. However, if you are uncomfortable, it\'s fine to take these medications. Young people (including those in their early 20s), however, should avoid aspirin. Tylenol, or other medicines with acetaminophen, and Advil, or other medicines with ibuprofen, are best. Each type of medicine has its own set of risks, so check with your doctor or pharmacist as to which type of pain reliever or fever reducer is best for you. Be careful not to overdose! These drugs are often mixed in with cough and cold and flu remedies. Read the labels and don\'t take a separate pain remedy if your cough or cold medicine includes it. If you are unsure about the ingredients, talk to your pharmacist before taking the medicine. Drinking lots of fluids and using salt water gargles (made by combining a cup of warm water and a teaspoon of salt) can often be helpful for easing the pain of a sore throat. Some oral medications (such as Tylenol) and medicated lozenges and gargles can also temporarily soothe a sore throat. \x1b[92m[3] Get your doctor\'s approval before using any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, and don\'t use lozenges or gargles for more than a few days.\x1b[0m The drugs could mask signs of strep throat, a bacterial infection that should be treated with antibiotics.']",How often should I use nasal spray?,"The frequency of nasal spray usage depends on the type of spray and the specific condition being treated.

The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. Early side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, usually don't last long. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The most common early side effects are fatigue and skin problems. You might get others, such as hair loss and nausea, depending on where you get radiation. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It also can seem different from day to day, which makes it hard to plan around it. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. Let your doctor know if you're struggling with fatigue. She might be able to help. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. Save your energy for the activities that are most important to you. Tackle them first when you're feeling up to it. Keep a balance between rest and activities. Too much bed rest can make you more tired. But don't over-schedule your days without giving yourself breaks. Ask for help from family and friends. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. It may look red, sunburned, or tanned. It may also get swollen or blistered. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Or it may start to peel. Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated. Don't scrub or rub your skin. \x1b[92m[0] To clean it, use a mild soap and let lukewarm water run over it.\x1b[0m \x1b[92m[5] Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to.\x1b[0m Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. Stay out of the sun as much as possible. Cover the area getting radiation with clothing or hats to protect it. Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors. If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra. If that isn't possible, wear a soft, cotton one without underwire. Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. But when it heals, it may be a darker color. \x1b[92m[11] And you'll still need to protect yourself from the sun even after radiation therapy has ended.\x1b[0m Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it's usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Other early side effects you might have usually depend on where you get the radiation. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. But it's important to keep eating a healthy diet while you're having treatment to keep your body strong. Try eating five or six small meals spread out through the day instead of three large ones. Try new recipes or foods. Keep healthy snacks on hand. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Don't smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol. Brush your teeth often with fluoride toothpaste and a soft brush. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. One reason might be that it hardens the wax in your ears. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Let your doctor know if that happens. She can give you medicine to control it. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. The doctor will likely prescribe medications to help control it. She'll also suggest changes in your diet, such as eating small meals more often, avoiding high-fiber foods, and getting enough potassium. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. Women shouldn't try to get pregnant during radiation therapy because it can hurt the baby. It also can stop periods and cause other symptoms of menopause. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't father a child. But if you want to have kids later on, you should talk with your doctor to see if you should use a sperm bank before treatment begins. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. But your sex drive will usually come back after treatment stops. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. Make sure you listen to their concerns, too. Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don't go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated. Talk with your doctor about the potential risk and how it compares to the benefits you'll get from radiation therapy.""]",How can you take care of your skin from radiation therapy?,"To care for your skin during radiation therapy, it's crucial to keep the treated area clean and dry, gently washing with mild soap and lukewarm water [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m.

Talk to your provider about your options.Emergency contraception should not be used as a routine birth control method. It does not work as well as most types of birth control.Alternative Names\n"", ""Your doctor or pharmacist can help you get answers about emergency contraception. You may want to ask them: There are lots of good options. But the best one for you depends on different things. Your age, for instance -- some nonprescription products have age limits. Your insurance may pay only for a prescription. When you had sex can matter, too. Some products work for about 3 days after, some for 5. Your doctor or pharmacist can steer you in the right direction. The copper- T intrauterine device ( IUD) can work as emergency contraception. The IUD goes inside your body. If you want an IUD, a nurse or doctor needs to put it in within 5 days of when you had sex. The IUD works as both emergency contraception and as ongoing birth control. It prevents pregnancy as long as it is in place. The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception. . Ask your doctor if an IUD might be a good choice for you, especially if you already wanted long-term birth control. There are 3 types of emergency contraception in pill form that are sold both with and without a prescription. You need to be 17 to buy them if a prescription is needed.

Pills containing a hormone called levonorgestrel: My Way (over-the-counter) Plan B One- Step (over-the-counter) Preventeza (over-the-counter) Take Action (over-the-counter) 2. Birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception, but you have to take more than one pill at a time to keep from getting pregnant. This approach works, but it is less effective and more likely to cause nausea than levonorgestrel. Birth control pills require a prescription. Talk to your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking the correct pills and dose. 3. A third kind of emergency contraception pill is called ulipristal (ella, ella One). \x1b[92m[0] You need a prescription to get it.\x1b[0m Some meds and supplements -- such as the epilepsy drug Dilantin, antibiotics such as rifampicin or griseofulvin, and St. John's wort -- can stop emergency contraception pills from working normally. To be safe, tell your doctor or pharmacist about other drugs and supplements you take. Emergency birth-control pills and the IUD are safe for almost all women. \x1b[92m[3] But if you have medical problems and you're concerned that taking emergency contraception could be risky, talk to a doctor or pharmacist.\x1b[0m The pills may not work as well for women who are overweight or obese. It may be awkward to discuss, but ask a pharmacist or doctor. If you're overweight, Ella may work better than Plan B One- Step and generic levonorgestrel. In general, the IUD seems to work better than pills for heavier women. You should use a regular form of birth control right away. Emergency contraception lasts only for about 24 hours and may just delay ovulation, not stop it. Make sure you're protected. Some types of emergency contraception may not be safe if you're already pregnant. Most pills won't harm your pregnancy. But you should not take Ella if you think you might be pregnant. It's not safe.

It helps make the outer membranes of our bodies\' cells stable. But for decades, doctors have known that people with high total cholesterol levels are more likely to get heart disease. More recently, they\'ve found the different forms of cholesterol (""good"" and ""bad"") also play a role. High total cholesterol, high bad cholesterol, or low good cholesterol could raise your chances. For example, LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol can stick to blood vessel walls. Over years, it can play a role in clogging arteries in a process called atherosclerosis. Narrowed arteries in your heart can then develop sudden blood clots, causing heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends that everyone over age 20 get a cholesterol test so you know what your levels are and can do something about them if you need to. The different kinds of cholesterol and other fats in your blood are together called lipids. Doctors measure and diagnose lipid problems with a simple blood test. You\'ll probably have to fast for 9 to 12 hours before it to make sure it\'s not affected by any food you recently ate. A lipid profile usually gives results for four different types: Total cholesterol LDL (low-density lipoprotein), the ""bad cholesterol"" HDL (high-density lipoprotein), the ""good cholesterol"" Triglycerides, another form of fat Some lipid panels can give even more detailed information, like the presence and sizes of various fat particles in your blood. Researchers are looking into what, if any, effect these traits have on heart disease. There\'s no clear guidelines on when this more advanced testing is needed. So you\'ve gone hungry overnight, endured a small bloodletting, and dutifully returned to get your results. Now, what do the numbers mean? For total cholesterol: 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L) or less is normal. 201 to 240 mg/d L is borderline. More than 240 mg/d L is high. For HDL (""good cholesterol""), more is better: 60 mg/d L or higher is good -- it protects against heart disease. 40 to 59 mg/d L is OK. Less than 40 mg/d L is low, raising your chance of heart disease. For LDL (""bad cholesterol""), lower is better: Less than 100 mg/d L is ideal. 100 to 129 mg/d L can be good, depending on your health. 130 to 159 mg/d L is borderline high. 160 to 189 mg/d L is high. 190 mg/d L or more is very high. Your doctor will consider your overall likelihood of heart disease to set your personal LDL goal. For people at great risk of heart disease, or who already have it, your LDL should be less than 100 mg/d L. ( Your heart doctor might recommend an even lower LDL -- less than 70 mg/d L -- if your risk of heart disease is very high.) If you have a moderately high chance, an LDL less than 130 mg/d L is your target. If you\'re not likely to get heart disease, less than 160 mg/d L is probably fine. High triglycerides (150 mg/d L or greater) also raise the odds for heart disease somewhat. \x1b[92m[4] Lifestyle changes are the first thing to tackle to reduce your chance of heart disease.\x1b[0m A cholesterol-lowering diet can bring down bad cholesterol by up to 30%. A diet low in saturated fat (7% of total calories or less) and no more than 200 mg of cholesterol daily can lower LDL cholesterol. Fiber and plant sterols (found in special margarines and other foods) help, too. Regular aerobic exercise can both lower bad cholesterol ( LDL) and raise good cholesterol ( HDL). If diet and exercise don\'t lower cholesterol levels enough, you can try medications or a combination of treatments including: Statins, the most effective and commonly used cholesterol drugs Niacin Fibrates Zetia Bile acid sequestrants Your cholesterol numbers don\'t determine your destiny. Remember, other things besides cholesterol can also lead to heart disease. Diabetes, smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, exercise, and genetics are important as well. People with normal cholesterol can have heart disease; people with high cholesterol can have healthy hearts. Overall, though, more people whose cholesterol levels are off will get heart disease. Experts recommend follow-up cholesterol testing every 5 years for most people. If your lipid results aren\'t what you and your doctor had hoped for, or if you have other reasons to be concerned about heart disease, you\'ll need cholesterol tests more often.']",What can you do about abnormal lipid levels?,"To address abnormal lipid levels, it's essential to adopt a healthier lifestyle [92m[0][0m[92m[1][0m[92m[2][0m[92m[3][0m[92m[4][0m[92m[5][0m.
