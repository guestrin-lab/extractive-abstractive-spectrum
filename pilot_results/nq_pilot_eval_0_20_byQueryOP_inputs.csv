8,26,"['  The program premiered on History on January 6, 2014.[4] The eleventh season premiered on November 7, 2023.  The Curse of Oak Island follows brothers Marty and Rick Lagina,[5] originally from Kingsford, Michigan, through their efforts to find the speculated treasure believed to be on Oak Island. The series discusses the history of the island, recent discoveries, theories, and earlier investigations of the site.[6] Areas of interest include the ""money pit"", Borehole 10-X, Smith\'s Cove, Site 2, ""Nolan\'s Cross"", the ""Hatch"", and the ""Swamp"".  While wholesale treasure has not been found, some coins and artifacts have been dug up on the island over the years.[7][8][9][10]  Some have speculated the show is a hoax and false news, while others speculate that if there ever was any treasure, it is already gone.[7][14]  Initially, the cast consisted of a core group including Rick, Marty, and Alex Lagina, Dan and Dave Blankenship, Craig Tester, Jack Begley, Dan Henskee, Charles Barkhouse, and Peter Fornetti. Over time, the Oak Island team has expanded. Some specialists who have been brought to the island for specific purposes, such as Terry Matheson, Laird Niven, and Gary Drayton, have joined the team as full-time members.

Exterior filming of the accident took place at Big Bear Lake, California. Jason George reprised his role as a guest-star, whereas James LeGros made his first appearance. The episode received widespread critical acclaim from television critics and audiences alike, with major praise directed towards Leigh\'s, Ellen Pompeo\'s (Dr. Meredith Grey) and Eric Dane\'s (Dr. Mark Sloan) performances. ""Flight"" earned Rhimes an NAACP Image Award nomination and it was also nominated under several categories of Entertainment Weekly\'s finale awards. Upon its initial airing, the episode was viewed in the United States by 11.44 million people, received a 4.1/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, ranking #4 for the night in terms of viewership, and registering as Thursday\'s highest-rated drama.  After their plane crashes in the woods, Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo),  Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) and Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) desperately fight to stay alive. Meredith is relatively unscathed, while the rest have serious injuries: the pilot, Jerry (James LeGros), has a major spine injury, and Yang dislocates her arm. Robbins has an open femur fracture, and Sloan has serious internal injuries, though initially adrenaline keeps him on his feet. Shepherd is sucked out the side of the plane and awakens alone in the woods, his mangled hand having been pushed through the door of the plane. However, none are in as bad shape as Lexie, who is crushed under a piece of the plane. While Meredith searches for Shepherd, Yang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie. Eventually, the two realize that they cannot save Lexie, so Sloan holds Lexie\'s hand while she dies, telling her that he loves her. As Sloan tells her of the life the two were meant to have together, Lexie dies with a smile on her face just as Meredith and Yang are approaching.

Flint in 1850 during the California Gold Rush period.[4] Commercial hop production in California began in 1854 in order to satisfy a growing demand for beer given the large influx of immigrant miners and farmers that were settling in the state.[4] As the hop industry expanded on the west coast, hop production on the east coast began to centralize in New York during the 1880s.[2] However, it diminished at the hands of several waves of disease and reduced demand for hops as a result of prohibition.[5] Furthermore, hop growth nationwide faced a steep decline with Prohibition, shrinking large growing regions into small pockets along the west coast, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Following the devastating effects of two world wars in Europe, American hop growers of the Pacific Northwest would reemerge as a main competitor in the world hop market.[2]  United States hop production grew 5% from 2018 to 2019 reaching a record number of over 112 million pounds.[6] Production value was estimated to be worth more than 636 million dollars in 2019.[6]  Hops grow on bines that may reach up to 25 feet in height.[7] Hop bines are trained to wrap around strings or wires strung between trellises.

Hop farms in the Pacific Northwest region comprise approximately 96% of total United States hop acreage.[3] One acre of hops consists of 889  plants, each of which can produce upwards of two pounds of cones.[3] Hop acreage is categorized by alpha, aroma, and dual purpose type and further divided by varietals.

22,30,"['Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries.  It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl(Si2O5)2, lepidolite K(Li,Al)3(Al,Si,Rb)4O10(F,OH)2, spodumene LiAl(SiO3)2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world’s largest producers of lithium.  Lithium was first discovered in the mineral petalite. Lepidolite and spodumene are other common minerals which contain lithium. Commercial quantities of these three minerals are found in a special igneous rock deposit that geologists call pegmatite. In pegmatites, magma cools so slowly that crystals have time to grow very large. Because lepidolite is a type of mica, its crystals grow into long thin sheets.  Lithium resources are detailed in the USGS Mineral Commodities Summaries.  Mining for Lithium:  Lithium is often recovered from brine, or water with a high concentration of lithium carbonate. Subsurface brines trapped in the Earth’s crust are a major source material for lithium carbonate.

24,24,"['Located on the outskirts of York, New Earswick was founded in 1902 by the Quaker chocolate manufacturer and philanthropist Joseph Rowntree. The garden village was partly a response to the poor conditions of the city, which had been exposed by Rowntree’s son Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree in his groundbreaking Poverty study. The founder’s vision was a prosperous, self-governing community in which everyone could aspire to a better life.  In order to make the fullest contribution, housing was not limited to Rowntree’s own employees but was open to all members of the working classes. Houses were to be let at affordable rents but which would still generate a limited return. This allowed Rowntree to demonstrate that his garden village was a model that could be replicated elsewhere. From 1904 onwards, the village was managed by a trust set up by the founder, which continues to this day as the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust.  Nestled next to the River Foss two miles north of York, the village plan took full advantage of its once rural location with gently curving streets that follow the course of the river. The first plan was laid out by the architects Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, who later went on to design Letchworth Garden City among many other garden city-inspired schemes. Like Letchworth, New Earswick offered low-density building, limited to ten houses per acre, with ample green space and soft landscaping. Many of the streets were named for the trees planted throughout the village: Chestnut Grove, Rowan Place and Lime Tree Avenue.  ', 'The ‘garden village’ of New Earswick on the northern side of York influenced housing patterns in England and elsewhere for more than 60 years of the 20th century. It was built for Joseph Rowntree (1835-1925) the Quaker chocolate and cocoa manufacturer whose factory was nearby. Construction began in 1902 the year after the publication by Rowntree’s son, Seebohm Rowntree (1871-1954) of his social survey of York, Poverty: a study of town life. The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall.

Three Dog Night didn\'t write ""Joy To The World"" -- that was Hoyt Axton -- and its curious line about a bullfrog named Jeremiah wasn\'t even intended to be committed to vinyl, much less played on radio.    The song was written by Hoyt Axton, a country music singer, guitarist, songwriter and actor. He had established himself in the early 1960s with his rich, smooth and powerful voice.

Three Dog Night didn\'t write ""Joy To The World"" -- that was Hoyt Axton -- and its curious line about a bullfrog named Jeremiah wasn\'t even intended to be committed to vinyl, much less played on radio.    The song was written by Hoyt Axton, a country music singer, guitarist, songwriter and actor. He had established himself in the early 1960s with his rich, smooth and powerful voice.

We should befriend Jeremiah. His words help us see our sin and help us confess that sin.

In 2019, the U.S. accounted for 40% of world hop production and 39% of world hop acreage.[1]  Dutch and English settlers of the New England colonies began importing hops for brewing and medicinal use as early as the 17th century.[2] The Massachusetts Company began commercially growing hops for colonial brewing in 1629.[3] European hop rhizomes were later brought to the west coast by Wilson G. Flint in 1850 during the California Gold Rush period.[4] Commercial hop production in California began in 1854 in order to satisfy a growing demand for beer given the large influx of immigrant miners and farmers that were settling in the state.[4] As the hop industry expanded on the west coast, hop production on the east coast began to centralize in New York during the 1880s.[2] However, it diminished at the hands of several waves of disease and reduced demand for hops as a result of prohibition.[5] Furthermore, hop growth nationwide faced a steep decline with Prohibition, shrinking large growing regions into small pockets along the west coast, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Following the devastating effects of two world wars in Europe, American hop growers of the Pacific Northwest would reemerge as a main competitor in the world hop market.[2]  United States hop production grew 5% from 2018 to 2019 reaching a record number of over 112 million pounds.[6] Production value was estimated to be worth more than 636 million dollars in 2019.[6]  Hops grow on bines that may reach up to 25 feet in height.[7] Hop bines are trained to wrap around strings or wires strung between trellises. Following the harvest, hops are kilned for drying before being pressed flat and compiled into bales. Hops are sold in whole cone and pelletized form.  Hop farms in the Pacific Northwest region comprise approximately 96% of total United States hop acreage.[3] One acre of hops consists of 889  plants, each of which can produce upwards of two pounds of cones.[3] Hop acreage is categorized by alpha, aroma, and dual purpose type and further divided by varietals. Since 2011, aroma varietal acreage has increased at a rapid rate,[1] likely due to the popularization of American IPA beer styles and an increased demand for new aroma profiles in beer.[8]  ""]",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_production_in_the_United_States'],"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_production_in_the_United_States\n  The United States of America is the world's largest producer of hops, the flowers of female Humulus lupulus plants.[1] The primary use of hops grown in the United States is in brewing.

In 2019, the U.S. accounted for 40% of world hop production and 39% of world hop acreage.[1]  Dutch and English settlers of the New England colonies began importing hops for brewing and medicinal use as early as the 17th century.[2] The Massachusetts Company began commercially growing hops for colonial brewing in 1629.[3] European hop rhizomes were later brought to the west coast by Wilson G. Flint in 1850 during the California Gold Rush period.[4] Commercial hop production in California began in 1854 in order to satisfy a growing demand for beer given the large influx of immigrant miners and farmers that were settling in the state.[4] As the hop industry expanded on the west coast, hop production on the east coast began to centralize in New York during the 1880s.[2] However, it diminished at the hands of several waves of disease and reduced demand for hops as a result of prohibition.[5] Furthermore, hop growth nationwide faced a steep decline with Prohibition, shrinking large growing regions into small pockets along the west coast, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Following the devastating effects of two world wars in Europe, American hop growers of the Pacific Northwest would reemerge as a main competitor in the world hop market.[2]  United States hop production grew 5% from 2018 to 2019 reaching a record number of over 112 million pounds.[6] Production value was estimated to be worth more than 636 million dollars in 2019.[6]  Hops grow on bines that may reach up to 25 feet in height.[7] Hop bines are trained to wrap around strings or wires strung between trellises. Following the harvest, hops are kilned for drying before being pressed flat and compiled into bales. Hops are sold in whole cone and pelletized form.  \x1b[92m[1] Hop farms in the Pacific Northwest region comprise approximately 96% of total United States hop acreage\x1b[0m.[3] One acre of hops consists of 889  plants, each of which can produce upwards of two pounds of cones.[3] Hop acreage is categorized by alpha, aroma, and dual purpose type and further divided by varietals.

High Trees House Ltd leased a block of flats in Battersea, London from Central London Property Trust Ltd. The agreement was made in 1937 and specified an annual ground rent of £2,500. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 led to a downturn in the rental market. High Trees struggled to find tenants for the property and approached Central London Property Trust in January 1940 to request that the rent be lowered. A reduction to £1,250 per year was agreed in writing, though the duration was not specified and no consideration was provided.  Based on previous judgments as Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co, Denning J held that the full rent was payable from the time that the flats became fully occupied in mid-1945. However, he continued in an obiter statement that if Central London had tried to claim for the full rent from 1940 onwards, they would not have been able to. This was reasoned on the basis that if a party leads another party to believe that he will not enforce his strict legal rights, then the courts will prevent him from doing so at a later stage. Being obiter dicta and in a court of first instance this was doubly not a binding precedent, yet it essentially created the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

52,24,"['Located on the outskirts of York, New Earswick was founded in 1902 by the Quaker chocolate manufacturer and philanthropist Joseph Rowntree. The garden village was partly a response to the poor conditions of the city, which had been exposed by Rowntree’s son Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree in his groundbreaking Poverty study. The founder’s vision was a prosperous, self-governing community in which everyone could aspire to a better life.  In order to make the fullest contribution, housing was not limited to Rowntree’s own employees but was open to all members of the working classes. Houses were to be let at affordable rents but which would still generate a limited return. This allowed Rowntree to demonstrate that his garden village was a model that could be replicated elsewhere. From 1904 onwards, the village was managed by a trust set up by the founder, which continues to this day as the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust.  Nestled next to the River Foss two miles north of York, the village plan took full advantage of its once rural location with gently curving streets that follow the course of the river. The first plan was laid out by the architects Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, who later went on to design Letchworth Garden City among many other garden city-inspired schemes. Like Letchworth, New Earswick offered low-density building, limited to ten houses per acre, with ample green space and soft landscaping. Many of the streets were named for the trees planted throughout the village: Chestnut Grove, Rowan Place and Lime Tree Avenue.  ', 'The ‘garden village’ of New Earswick on the northern side of York influenced housing patterns in England and elsewhere for more than 60 years of the 20th century. It was built for Joseph Rowntree (1835-1925) the Quaker chocolate and cocoa manufacturer whose factory was nearby. Construction began in 1902 the year after the publication by Rowntree’s son, Seebohm Rowntree (1871-1954) of his social survey of York, Poverty: a study of town life. The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall. Many of the houses were built in cul-de-sacs which set an example that was copied by builders all over England in the 1920s and 30s. There are extensive open spaces and many trees.

In 1802, philosopher William Paley called it a miracle of ""design."" In 1859, Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species, that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance ""absurd in the highest possible degree"".[3] However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible:  ', 'Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors.[5] Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classic paper that only a few hundred thousand generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates.[6] Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through.[7] All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin\'s theory.  The first possible fossils of eyes found to date are from the Ediacaran period (about 555 million years ago),[8] while the oldest certain fossilized eye is from a Schmidtiellus reetae fossil from 530 mya, collected in Saviranna in northern Estonia. The structure is similar to the compound eyes of modern-day dragonflies and bees, but with (~100) ommatidia spaced further apart, and without a lens.[9][10] The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the ""Cambrian explosion"".  One of the many hypotheses for ""causes"" of the Cambrian explosion is the ""Light Switch"" theory of Andrew Parker: it holds that the evolution of advanced eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution.[11] Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision.

In 1859, Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species, that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance ""absurd in the highest possible degree"".[3] However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible:  ', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye\nBiologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors.[5] Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classic paper that only a few hundred thousand generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates.[6] Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through.[7] All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin\'s theory.  \x1b[96m[1] The first possible fossils of eyes found to date are from the Ediacaran period (about 555 million years ago)\x1b[0m,[8] while the oldest certain fossilized eye is from a Schmidtiellus reetae fossil from 530 mya, collected in Saviranna in northern Estonia. The structure is similar to the compound eyes of modern-day dragonflies and bees, but with (~100) ommatidia spaced further apart, and without a lens.[9][10] The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the ""Cambrian explosion"".  One of the many hypotheses for ""causes"" of the Cambrian explosion is the ""Light Switch"" theory of Andrew Parker: it holds that the evolution of advanced eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution.[11] Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision.

It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl(Si2O5)2, lepidolite K(Li,Al)3(Al,Si,Rb)4O10(F,OH)2, spodumene LiAl(SiO3)2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world’s largest producers of lithium.  Lithium was first discovered in the mineral petalite. Lepidolite and spodumene are other common minerals which contain lithium. Commercial quantities of these three minerals are found in a special igneous rock deposit that geologists call pegmatite. In pegmatites, magma cools so slowly that crystals have time to grow very large. Because lepidolite is a type of mica, its crystals grow into long thin sheets.  Lithium resources are detailed in the USGS Mineral Commodities Summaries.  Mining for Lithium:  Lithium is often recovered from brine, or water with a high concentration of lithium carbonate. Subsurface brines trapped in the Earth’s crust are a major source material for lithium carbonate. These sources are less expensive to mine than from rock such as spodumene, petalite, and other lithium-bearing minerals.  Brine production of lithium begins by first pumping the brine into evaporative ponds. Over 12 to 18 months, concentration of the brine increases to 6,000 ppm Li through solar evaporation. When the lithium chloride reaches optimum concentration, the liquid is pumped to a recovery plant and treated with soda ash, precipitating lithium carbonate, which is then filtrated, dried, and shipped.  Lithium compounds are used in ceramics and glass, in primary aluminum production, in the manufacture of lubricants and greases, rocket propellants, vitamin A synthesis, silver solders, underwater buoyancy devices, and increasingly in batteries.  Lithium batteries are proving to be an effective and affordable alternative to traditional batteries, and also used in new battery applications.  More than 80% of lithium mined is used in batteries.  This use has recently increased rapidly spurring an increase in lithium mining to provide the lithium for batteries.  Lithium is mixed with other light metals such as aluminum and magnesium to form strong, light-weight alloys (an alloy is a mixture of metals).  Some lithium, in the form of lithium carbonate or lithium citrate, is used as medicine to treat gout (an inflammation of joints) and to treat serious mental illness.

']","['https://mineralseducationcoalition.org/minerals-database/lithium/\n\x1b[92m[1] Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries\x1b[0m.  It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl(Si2O5)2, lepidolite K(Li,Al)3(Al,Si,Rb)4O10(F,OH)2, spodumene LiAl(SiO3)2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world’s largest producers of lithium.  Lithium was first discovered in the mineral petalite. Lepidolite and spodumene are other common minerals which contain lithium. Commercial quantities of these three minerals are found in a special igneous rock deposit that geologists call pegmatite. In pegmatites, magma cools so slowly that crystals have time to grow very large. Because lepidolite is a type of mica, its crystals grow into long thin sheets.  Lithium resources are detailed in the USGS Mineral Commodities Summaries.  Mining for Lithium:  Lithium is often recovered from brine, or water with a high concentration of lithium carbonate. Subsurface brines trapped in the Earth’s crust are a major source material for lithium carbonate. These sources are less expensive to mine than from rock such as spodumene, petalite, and other lithium-bearing minerals.  Brine production of lithium begins by first pumping the brine into evaporative ponds. Over 12 to 18 months, concentration of the brine increases to 6,000 ppm Li through solar evaporation. When the lithium chloride reaches optimum concentration, the liquid is pumped to a recovery plant and treated with soda ash, precipitating lithium carbonate, which is then filtrated, dried, and shipped.

One of the many hypotheses for ""causes"" of the Cambrian explosion is the ""Light Switch"" theory of Andrew Parker: it holds that the evolution of advanced eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution.[11] Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision.

Three Dog Night didn\'t write ""Joy To The World"" -- that was Hoyt Axton -- and its curious line about a bullfrog named Jeremiah wasn\'t even intended to be committed to vinyl, much less played on radio.    The song was written by Hoyt Axton, a country music singer, guitarist, songwriter and actor. He had established himself in the early 1960s with his rich, smooth and powerful voice. Axton had many hit songs to his credit. ""Joy to the World"" was a song he wrote in anticipation of an animated television special -- it was to be called ""The Happy Song."" The television special never happened, but that’s OK because Axton never actually finished the song. The story could have ended there.  ', 'Everyone knows the song, “Jeremiah was a Bullfrog.” I bet you can sing first verse and the chorus, no problem. It’s a very famous song and it’s a fun song. It’s a great song for backyard parties. Three Dog Night opens their famous song this way:  “Jeremiah was a bullfrog/was a good friend of mine/I never understood a single word he said/but I helped him drink his wine/and he always had some mighty fine wine.”  Then the chorus opens: “Joy to the world, all the boys and girls/joy to the fishies in the deep blue sea/joy to you and me.”  It’s a fun song, it’s about joy, it’s about having a good time, it’s easy to listen to, it makes you tap your feet; it’s just a great song.

We should befriend Jeremiah. His words help us see our sin and help us confess that sin.

Until the appointment of Ryder as director, the Mint had been without an official director since the resignation of Edmund C. Moy in 2011. Richard A. Peterson succeeded Moy. Peterson served between January 2011 and March 2017. The longest serving director was Nellie Ross. Ross, who had earlier been the first female governor in American history while serving the state of Wyoming, was director from 1933 until 1953.  In July 2015, Matthew Rhett Jeppson was nominated by President Barack Obama to become the Mint's 39th director and was given the temporary title of principal deputy director. However, the nomination was never confirmed by the Senate. Jeppson stepped down as principal deputy director in January 2017, then replaced by acting principal deputy director David Motl.

In 2019, the U.S. accounted for 40% of world hop production and 39% of world hop acreage.[1]  Dutch and English settlers of the New England colonies began importing hops for brewing and medicinal use as early as the 17th century.[2] The Massachusetts Company began commercially growing hops for colonial brewing in 1629.[3] European hop rhizomes were later brought to the west coast by Wilson G. Flint in 1850 during the California Gold Rush period.[4] Commercial hop production in California began in 1854 in order to satisfy a growing demand for beer given the large influx of immigrant miners and farmers that were settling in the state.[4] As the hop industry expanded on the west coast, hop production on the east coast began to centralize in New York during the 1880s.[2] However, it diminished at the hands of several waves of disease and reduced demand for hops as a result of prohibition.[5] Furthermore, hop growth nationwide faced a steep decline with Prohibition, shrinking large growing regions into small pockets along the west coast, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Following the devastating effects of two world wars in Europe, American hop growers of the Pacific Northwest would reemerge as a main competitor in the world hop market.[2]  United States hop production grew 5% from 2018 to 2019 reaching a record number of over 112 million pounds.[6] Production value was estimated to be worth more than 636 million dollars in 2019.[6]  Hops grow on bines that may reach up to 25 feet in height.[7] Hop bines are trained to wrap around strings or wires strung between trellises. Following the harvest, hops are kilned for drying before being pressed flat and compiled into bales. Hops are sold in whole cone and pelletized form.  Hop farms in the Pacific Northwest region comprise approximately 96% of total United States hop acreage.[3] One acre of hops consists of 889  plants, each of which can produce upwards of two pounds of cones.[3] Hop acreage is categorized by alpha, aroma, and dual purpose type and further divided by varietals.

It was written by Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf’s once and future collaborator. Steinman also planned out the video, which was then directed by Russell Mulcahy, a man responsible for numerous ’70s and ’80s music videos,  as well as the films Highlander, Highlander II: The Quickening, and Blue Ice.

It was written by Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf’s once and future collaborator. Steinman also planned out the video, which was then directed by Russell Mulcahy, a man responsible for numerous ’70s and ’80s music videos,  as well as the films Highlander, Highlander II: The Quickening, and Blue Ice.

It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl(Si2O5)2, lepidolite K(Li,Al)3(Al,Si,Rb)4O10(F,OH)2, spodumene LiAl(SiO3)2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world’s largest producers of lithium.  Lithium was first discovered in the mineral petalite. Lepidolite and spodumene are other common minerals which contain lithium. Commercial quantities of these three minerals are found in a special igneous rock deposit that geologists call pegmatite. In pegmatites, magma cools so slowly that crystals have time to grow very large. Because lepidolite is a type of mica, its crystals grow into long thin sheets.  Lithium resources are detailed in the USGS Mineral Commodities Summaries.  Mining for Lithium:  Lithium is often recovered from brine, or water with a high concentration of lithium carbonate. Subsurface brines trapped in the Earth’s crust are a major source material for lithium carbonate. These sources are less expensive to mine than from rock such as spodumene, petalite, and other lithium-bearing minerals.  Brine production of lithium begins by first pumping the brine into evaporative ponds. Over 12 to 18 months, concentration of the brine increases to 6,000 ppm Li through solar evaporation. When the lithium chloride reaches optimum concentration, the liquid is pumped to a recovery plant and treated with soda ash, precipitating lithium carbonate, which is then filtrated, dried, and shipped.  Lithium compounds are used in ceramics and glass, in primary aluminum production, in the manufacture of lubricants and greases, rocket propellants, vitamin A synthesis, silver solders, underwater buoyancy devices, and increasingly in batteries.  Lithium batteries are proving to be an effective and affordable alternative to traditional batteries, and also used in new battery applications.  More than 80% of lithium mined is used in batteries.  This use has recently increased rapidly spurring an increase in lithium mining to provide the lithium for batteries.  Lithium is mixed with other light metals such as aluminum and magnesium to form strong, light-weight alloys (an alloy is a mixture of metals).

In 2019, the U.S. accounted for 40% of world hop production and 39% of world hop acreage.[1]  Dutch and English settlers of the New England colonies began importing hops for brewing and medicinal use as early as the 17th century.[2] The Massachusetts Company began commercially growing hops for colonial brewing in 1629.[3] European hop rhizomes were later brought to the west coast by Wilson G. Flint in 1850 during the California Gold Rush period.[4] Commercial hop production in California began in 1854 in order to satisfy a growing demand for beer given the large influx of immigrant miners and farmers that were settling in the state.[4] As the hop industry expanded on the west coast, hop production on the east coast began to centralize in New York during the 1880s.[2] However, it diminished at the hands of several waves of disease and reduced demand for hops as a result of prohibition.[5] Furthermore, hop growth nationwide faced a steep decline with Prohibition, shrinking large growing regions into small pockets along the west coast, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Following the devastating effects of two world wars in Europe, American hop growers of the Pacific Northwest would reemerge as a main competitor in the world hop market.[2]  United States hop production grew 5% from 2018 to 2019 reaching a record number of over 112 million pounds.[6] Production value was estimated to be worth more than 636 million dollars in 2019.[6]  Hops grow on bines that may reach up to 25 feet in height.[7] Hop bines are trained to wrap around strings or wires strung between trellises. Following the harvest, hops are kilned for drying before being pressed flat and compiled into bales. Hops are sold in whole cone and pelletized form.  Hop farms in the Pacific Northwest region comprise approximately 96% of total United States hop acreage.[3] One acre of hops consists of 889  plants, each of which can produce upwards of two pounds of cones.[3] Hop acreage is categorized by alpha, aroma, and dual purpose type and further divided by varietals. Since 2011, aroma varietal acreage has increased at a rapid rate,[1] likely due to the popularization of American IPA beer styles and an increased demand for new aroma profiles in beer.[8]  ""]",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_production_in_the_United_States'],"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_production_in_the_United_States\n  The United States of America is the world's largest producer of hops, the flowers of female Humulus lupulus plants.[1] The primary use of hops grown in the United States is in brewing.

The garden village was partly a response to the poor conditions of the city, which had been exposed by Rowntree’s son Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree in his groundbreaking Poverty study. The founder’s vision was a prosperous, self-governing community in which everyone could aspire to a better life.  In order to make the fullest contribution, housing was not limited to Rowntree’s own employees but was open to all members of the working classes. Houses were to be let at affordable rents but which would still generate a limited return. This allowed Rowntree to demonstrate that his garden village was a model that could be replicated elsewhere. From 1904 onwards, the village was managed by a trust set up by the founder, which continues to this day as the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust.  Nestled next to the River Foss two miles north of York, the village plan took full advantage of its once rural location with gently curving streets that follow the course of the river. \x1b[92m The first plan was laid out by the architects Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin\x1b[0m, who later went on to design Letchworth Garden City among many other garden city-inspired schemes. Like Letchworth, New Earswick offered low-density building, limited to ten houses per acre, with ample green space and soft landscaping. Many of the streets were named for the trees planted throughout the village: Chestnut Grove, Rowan Place and Lime Tree Avenue.  ']",,,,,,,,,Snippet
92,30,"['Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries.  It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl(Si2O5)2, lepidolite K(Li,Al)3(Al,Si,Rb)4O10(F,OH)2, spodumene LiAl(SiO3)2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world’s largest producers of lithium.  Lithium was first discovered in the mineral petalite. Lepidolite and spodumene are other common minerals which contain lithium. Commercial quantities of these three minerals are found in a special igneous rock deposit that geologists call pegmatite. In pegmatites, magma cools so slowly that crystals have time to grow very large. Because lepidolite is a type of mica, its crystals grow into long thin sheets.  Lithium resources are detailed in the USGS Mineral Commodities Summaries.  Mining for Lithium:  Lithium is often recovered from brine, or water with a high concentration of lithium carbonate. Subsurface brines trapped in the Earth’s crust are a major source material for lithium carbonate. These sources are less expensive to mine than from rock such as spodumene, petalite, and other lithium-bearing minerals.  Brine production of lithium begins by first pumping the brine into evaporative ponds. Over 12 to 18 months, concentration of the brine increases to 6,000 ppm Li through solar evaporation. When the lithium chloride reaches optimum concentration, the liquid is pumped to a recovery plant and treated with soda ash, precipitating lithium carbonate, which is then filtrated, dried, and shipped.  Lithium compounds are used in ceramics and glass, in primary aluminum production, in the manufacture of lubricants and greases, rocket propellants, vitamin A synthesis, silver solders, underwater buoyancy devices, and increasingly in batteries.  Lithium batteries are proving to be an effective and affordable alternative to traditional batteries, and also used in new battery applications.  More than 80% of lithium mined is used in batteries.  This use has recently increased rapidly spurring an increase in lithium mining to provide the lithium for batteries.  Lithium is mixed with other light metals such as aluminum and magnesium to form strong, light-weight alloys (an alloy is a mixture of metals).  Some lithium, in the form of lithium carbonate or lithium citrate, is used as medicine to treat gout (an inflammation of joints) and to treat serious mental illness.

In 2019, the U.S. accounted for 40% of world hop production and 39% of world hop acreage.[1]  Dutch and English settlers of the New England colonies began importing hops for brewing and medicinal use as early as the 17th century.[2] The Massachusetts Company began commercially growing hops for colonial brewing in 1629.[3] European hop rhizomes were later brought to the west coast by Wilson G. Flint in 1850 during the California Gold Rush period.[4] Commercial hop production in California began in 1854 in order to satisfy a growing demand for beer given the large influx of immigrant miners and farmers that were settling in the state.[4] As the hop industry expanded on the west coast, hop production on the east coast began to centralize in New York during the 1880s.[2] However, it diminished at the hands of several waves of disease and reduced demand for hops as a result of prohibition.[5] Furthermore, hop growth nationwide faced a steep decline with Prohibition, shrinking large growing regions into small pockets along the west coast, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Following the devastating effects of two world wars in Europe, American hop growers of the Pacific Northwest would reemerge as a main competitor in the world hop market.[2]  United States hop production grew 5% from 2018 to 2019 reaching a record number of over 112 million pounds.[6] Production value was estimated to be worth more than 636 million dollars in 2019.[6]  Hops grow on bines that may reach up to 25 feet in height.[7] Hop bines are trained to wrap around strings or wires strung between trellises. Following the harvest, hops are kilned for drying before being pressed flat and compiled into bales. Hops are sold in whole cone and pelletized form.  Hop farms in the Pacific Northwest region comprise approximately 96% of total United States hop acreage.[3] One acre of hops consists of 889  plants, each of which can produce upwards of two pounds of cones.[3] Hop acreage is categorized by alpha, aroma, and dual purpose type and further divided by varietals.

97,24,"['Located on the outskirts of York, New Earswick was founded in 1902 by the Quaker chocolate manufacturer and philanthropist Joseph Rowntree. The garden village was partly a response to the poor conditions of the city, which had been exposed by Rowntree’s son Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree in his groundbreaking Poverty study. The founder’s vision was a prosperous, self-governing community in which everyone could aspire to a better life.  In order to make the fullest contribution, housing was not limited to Rowntree’s own employees but was open to all members of the working classes. Houses were to be let at affordable rents but which would still generate a limited return. This allowed Rowntree to demonstrate that his garden village was a model that could be replicated elsewhere. From 1904 onwards, the village was managed by a trust set up by the founder, which continues to this day as the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust.  Nestled next to the River Foss two miles north of York, the village plan took full advantage of its once rural location with gently curving streets that follow the course of the river. The first plan was laid out by the architects Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, who later went on to design Letchworth Garden City among many other garden city-inspired schemes. Like Letchworth, New Earswick offered low-density building, limited to ten houses per acre, with ample green space and soft landscaping. Many of the streets were named for the trees planted throughout the village: Chestnut Grove, Rowan Place and Lime Tree Avenue.  ', 'The ‘garden village’ of New Earswick on the northern side of York influenced housing patterns in England and elsewhere for more than 60 years of the 20th century. It was built for Joseph Rowntree (1835-1925) the Quaker chocolate and cocoa manufacturer whose factory was nearby. Construction began in 1902 the year after the publication by Rowntree’s son, Seebohm Rowntree (1871-1954) of his social survey of York, Poverty: a study of town life. The village was always intended to be open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The settlement was placed under the control of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust from 1904, and is now managed by the Joseph Rowntree foundation. The village was planned by Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and Barry Parker (1867-1947), who subsequently designed Letchworth Garden City, and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Their objective was to create a balanced community where rents, although low, should represent a modest commercial return on the capital invested, so that others might copy the example set. Terraces were built at various angles, spaced so that the main rooms would catch the sun. Many of the road names had rustic connotations – Chestnut Grove, Poplar Grove and Sycamore Avenue – and the social centre was named the Folk Hall. Many of the houses were built in cul-de-sacs which set an example that was copied by builders all over England in the 1920s and 30s. There are extensive open spaces and many trees.
