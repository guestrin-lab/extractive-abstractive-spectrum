who ran the fastest 40 yard dash in the nfl,NQ,,"<p><b>Source 1:</b> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Speed test in American football The 40-yard dash is a sprint covering 40 yards (36.576 m). It is primarily run to evaluate the speed and acceleration of American football players by scouts, particularly for the NFL draft but also for collegiate recruiting. A player's recorded time can have a heavy impact on his prospects in college or professional football. This was traditionally only true for the 'skill' positions such as running back, wide receiver, and defensive back, although now a fast 40-yard dash time is considered important for almost every position. The 40-yard dash is not an official race in track and field athletics, and is not an IAAF-recognized race. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> 1.40 seconds — Chris Johnson, RB, East Carolina, 2008. Drafted 24th overall by Tennessee, he ran for 2,006 yards and 14 TDs in 2009 and scored 55 times over a stellar 10-year career with the Titans, Jets and Cardinals. Whether prospects will eventually burn bright or flame out, fans needing their football fix between the Super Bowl and draft weekend can at least catch a glimpse of what's to come by watching what's known to many as the 'Underwear Olympics.' 'The 40s are the highlight for everybody,' said NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah, 'because you have history and you can compare what this guy ran this year to what said Hall of Famer ran in years past. ... It's an apples-to-apples comparison.' Copyright AP - Associated Press This article tagged under: NFL on now 3PM: News4 Midday Trending Stories Instagram Inappropriate? Or stunning?

He didn't want to injure himself. According to Jackson, he pulled up with 10 yards to go. His first attempt came in at 4.3. ''They said, what if we open the back door?' My coach had come up to me and said, 'Give these guys what they want, run through the tape, and go on out the door, you don't have to stop, run through the finish line,'' Jackson said. 'I waited about five minutes to get my breath, and they had other people. I got down there, and I took off and ran completely through. I just kept going right out the door and didn't come back.' For those of us who recall Jackson running through the tunnel at the end of a 91-yard touchdown run at the Kingdome in Seattle a year and a half later, this 40-yard dash was a precursor of things to come. After numerous reports of hand-held stopwatch times of 3.9 and 4-flat among the scouts, Jackson said the official timer was consulted. </p>",2025-11-19 13:37:31-08:00,True,"The answer is missing one or more double-quotation marks.

The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who stars alongside debutant Gracy Singh and British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne. Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of British colonial rule in India, the film follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory. Produced on a budget of ₹25 crore (US$5.3 million), Lagaan was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. It faced multiple challenges during production: Khan was initially skeptical to star in a sports film, and later, prospective producers called for budget cuts and script modifications. Eventually, the film would become the maiden project of Aamir Khan Productions, and mark Khan's foray into film production. Gowariker was inspired by aspects of the sports drama Naya Daur (1957) in developing the film. The language featured in the film was based on Awadhi, but was diluted with standard Hindi for modern audiences. Principal photography took place in villages near Bhuj. Nitin Chandrakant Desai served as art director, while Bhanu Athaiya was the costume designer. The original soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. </p>",2025-11-19 13:49:50-08:00,False,Response is valid.
when are two events said to be independent,NQ,"""Independent events are those events whose occurrence is not dependent on any other event""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Independent events are those events whose occurrence is not dependent on any other event. For example, if we flip a coin in the air and get the outcome as Head, then again if we flip the coin but this time we get the outcome as Tail. In both cases, the occurrence of both events is independent of each other. It is one of the types of events in probability. Let us learn here the complete definition of independent events along with its Venn diagram, examples and how it is different from mutually exclusive events. What are Independent Events? In Probability, the set of outcomes of an experiment is called events. There are different types of events such as independent events, dependent events, mutually exclusive events, and so on. If the probability of occurrence of an event A is not affected by the occurrence of another event B, then A and B are said to be independent events. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> alone. A similar equation holds for the conditional probability density functions in the continuous case. Independence can be seen as a special kind of conditional independence, since probability can be seen as a kind of conditional probability given no events. History Before 1933, independence, in probability theory, was defined in a verbal manner. For example, de Moivre gave the following definition: 'Two events are independent, when they have no connexion one with the other, and that the happening of one neither forwards nor obstructs the happening of the other'. If there are n independent events, the probability of the event, that all of them happen was computed as the product of the probabilities of these n events. Apparently, there was the conviction, that this formula was a consequence of the above definition. (Sometimes this was called the Multiplication Theorem.), Of course, a proof of his assertion cannot work without further more formal tacit assumptions. The definition of independence, given in this article, became the standard definition (now used in all books) after it appeared in 1933 as part of Kolmogorov's axiomatization of probability. Kolmogorov credited it to S.N. Bernstein, and quoted a publication which had appeared in Russian in 1927. Unfortunately, both Bernstein and Kolmogorov had not been aware of the work of the Georg Bohlmann. Bohlmann had given the same definition for two events in 1901 and for n events in 1908 In the latter paper, he studied his notion in detail. For example, he gave the first example showing that pairwise independence does not imply imply mutual independence. Even today, Bohlmann is rarely quoted. More about his work can be found in On the contributions of Georg Bohlmann to probability theory from de:Ulrich Krengel.

If the probability of occurrence of an event A is not affected by the occurrence of another event B, then A and B are said to be independent events. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> alone. A similar equation holds for the conditional probability density functions in the continuous case. Independence can be seen as a special kind of conditional independence, since probability can be seen as a kind of conditional probability given no events. History Before 1933, independence, in probability theory, was defined in a verbal manner. For example, de Moivre gave the following definition: 'Two events are independent, when they have no connexion one with the other, and that the happening of one neither forwards nor obstructs the happening of the other'. If there are n independent events, the probability of the event, that all of them happen was computed as the product of the probabilities of these n events. Apparently, there was the conviction, that this formula was a consequence of the above definition. (Sometimes this was called the Multiplication Theorem.), Of course, a proof of his assertion cannot work without further more formal tacit assumptions. The definition of independence, given in this article, became the standard definition (now used in all books) after it appeared in 1933 as part of Kolmogorov's axiomatization of probability. Kolmogorov credited it to S.N. Bernstein, and quoted a publication which had appeared in Russian in 1927. Unfortunately, both Bernstein and Kolmogorov had not been aware of the work of the Georg Bohlmann. Bohlmann had given the same definition for two events in 1901 and for n events in 1908 In the latter paper, he studied his notion in detail. For example, he gave the first example showing that pairwise independence does not imply imply mutual independence. Even today, Bohlmann is rarely quoted.

The song was written by Kygo, Gomez, Brian Lee, Ali Tamposi, and Andrew Watt and produced by Kygo, Watt and Louis Bell. An EDM, dance-pop, electropop and tropical house song, 'It Ain't Me' comprises an acoustic guitar line, and a build-drop arrangement in its chorus featuring pulsing piano notes, bass, synthesizers, finger-snap claps and pan flute melodies. Gomez sings the track in a husky tone, while in the chorus her vocals are reduced to recurring syllables. The lyrics narrate a past relationship ruined by alcoholism. The lyrics to 'It Ain't Me' were written by Andrew Watt, Brian Lee and Ali Tamposi. With Watt previously working with Kygo, the DJ's manager Myles Shear contacted Watt for a session with Kygo which Watt also facilitated for Lee and Tamposi. During their session for 'It Ain't Me', they initially found the track very poor, but were trying to salvage it. Kygo and Shear suggested that they continue working on the song. After Kygo and Shear had left, Tamposi told Watt and Lee to play guitar and 'Fleetwood Mac it', spawning a 45-minute jam session as well as the demo of 'It Ain't Me', a simple acoustic guitar recording with Tamposi on vocals. Watt, Lee and Tamposi then asked Kygo to return to their studio to hear 'It Ain't Me' for a second time. Tamposi recalled, 'When they pushed the space bar to play the song, [Kygo] went from this very sweet, polite, charming young man to this super-human producer guy. I was watching his eyes go back, left and right, just mapping out how he envisioned the production of the song. He was extremely excited'.

He gained wide recognition in the 1960s for playing secret agent Illya Kuryakin in the television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E (1964–1968). His other notable television roles include Simon Carter in Colditz (1972–1974) and Steel in Sapphire & Steel (1979–1982). Beginning in 2003, McCallum gained renewed international popularity for his role as NCIS medical examiner Dr. Donald 'Ducky' Mallard in the American CBS television series NCIS, which he played for 20 seasons until his death in 2023. In film role, McCallum notably appeared in The Great Escape (1963), and as Judas Iscariot in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965). Early life </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Beginning in 2003, starting with the original backdoor pilot on the series JAG, McCallum starred in the CBS television series NCIS as Dr. Donald 'Ducky' Mallard, the team's chief medical examiner and one of the show's most popular characters. In Season 2 Episode 13 'The Meat Puzzle', NCIS Special Agent Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander) asks Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), 'What did Ducky look like when he was younger?' and Gibbs replies, 'Illya Kuryakin'. According to the behind-the-scenes feature on the 2006 DVD of NCIS season 1, McCallum became an expert in forensics to play Mallard, including attending medical examiner conventions. In the feature, Donald P. Bellisario says that McCallum's knowledge became so vast that at the time of the interview, he was considering making him a technical adviser to the show. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> 'He was a true Renaissance man — he was fascinated by science and culture and would turn those passions into knowledge. For example, he was capable of conducting a symphony orchestra and (if needed) could actually perform an autopsy, based on his decades-long studies for his role on NCIS,' Peter McCallum said in a statement. In 2007, when he was working on 'NCIS,' McCallum told a reporter: 'I've always felt the harder I work, the luckier I get. I believe in serendipitous things happening, but at the same time, dedicating yourself to what you do is the best way to get along in this life.'

The text/html serialization of HTML5, which is not SGML-based, uses the DOCTYPE only for mode selection. Since web browsers are implemented with special-purpose HTML parsers, rather than general-purpose DTD-based parsers, they do not use DTDs and never access them even if a URL is provided. The DOCTYPE is retained in HTML5 as a 'mostly useless, but required' header only to trigger 'standards mode' in common browsers. Syntax The general syntax for a document type declaration is: &lt;!DOCTYPE root-element PUBLIC '/quotedFPI/' '/quotedURI/' [ &lt;!-- internal subset declarations --&gt; ]&gt; or &lt;!DOCTYPE root-element SYSTEM '/quotedURI/' [ &lt;!-- internal subset declarations --&gt; ]&gt; Document type name The opening &lt;!DOCTYPE syntax is followed by separating syntax: 403–404  (such as spaces,: 297–298, 372  or (except in XML) comments opened and closed by a doubled ASCII hyphen),: 372, 391  followed by a document type name: 403–404  (i.e. the name of the root element that the DTD applies to trees descending from).

Essentially, fore is a warning to everyone on the golf course that a ball has been hit and is coming their way instead of the intended area. Another way to define the golf term fore is by some synonyms such as 'watch out' or 'heads up'. It is used when a golfer hits a bad shot that goes so far offline that it could hit an unexpected golfer, or come close to them.It is proper etiquette to yell fore when this happens, and to point in the direction it's heading for those who are too far away to hear you. The History of Fore in GolfThere are some different theories on how the golf term fore came to be:1. It is believed that the term 'forecaddie' is how the term 'fore' came to be. In the 1700's and 1800's 'forecaddie' was someone who was hired by golf courses or golfers to keep track of where balls landed. Nowadays this position is called a spotter. A forecaddie would stand where they suspected the balls were going to land to save time looking for rogue balls, and balls wasted. When the golfer would strike the ball they would yell 'forecaddie' so that they would know to keep an eye out for the oncoming ball. As golf developed more the term 'forecaddie' was shortened to 'fore' and is now used to warn golfers to 'look out' because there's a possibility that the ball is coming their way. 2. The second is from a military standpoint. When infantry advanced in formation in the 17th and 18th centuries, artillery batteries fired behind them shooting over their heads. An artilleryman about to fire would yell 'beware before' so that the infantry would know to avoid the shells that would be raining down from the sky.

Air and CO2 guns with a muzzle energy of at least 7.5 joules, or if there is risk of confusion with a firearm. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> In order to purchase most weapons, the purchaser must obtain a weapon acquisition permit (art. 8 WG/LArm). Swiss citizens and foreigners with a C permit over the age of 18 who are not under a curator nor identified as being a danger for themselves or others, and who do not have a criminal record with a conviction for a violent crime or of several convictions as long as they haven't been written out can request such a permit. Foreign nationals who do not have a settlement permit but who are resident in Switzerland must present the competent cantonal authority with an official attestation from their home country confirming they are authorised to acquire the weapon or essential weapon component in that country in order to buy (art. 9a WG/LArm). Foreigners with citizenship to the following countries are explicitly excluded from the right to buy, sell and own weapons and their parts unless they ask for an exceptional authorization to the state: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania.[note 1] </p>",2025-11-19 21:22:32-08:00,False,Response is valid.

We walked the beach our first evening there as the sun was setting, and I took a longer walk this morning as the sun was rising. For photos, I experimented with a few different iPhone settings, such as 'Vivid' and 'Dramatic.' If that resulted in images a bit more idealized than reality, that only seems fitting for the idyllic setting of Anne of Green Gables!

what type of political system does el salvador have,NQ,"""The Government of El Salvador is a presidential representative democratic republic""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Salvadoran government was run by military officers for nearly half a century, followed by a civil war (1980 – 1992) and a negotiated peace that established a functioning liberal democracy for the first time in the country's history. The resulting political leadership – on the right and on the left – agreed to abide by constitutional standards that provided for competitive elections and a market economy. However, the peace accord did not address the economic and social problems that gave rise to discontent and open conflict in previous decades. For the next 30 years, political debate centered precisely on the role of the state in promoting economic and social development.The ARENA party on the right governed until 2009, leading to the privatization of most banks, the introduction of the U.S. dollar as legal tender and the liberalization of trade. After the leftist Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN) assumed the presidency in 2009, the government shifted its focus toward assisting the disadvantaged sectors of the population through increased spending on education and health. Additionally, the government provided support for pension plans, which further strained government finances. By 2017, government debt and budget deficits had reached an unsustainable level, leading to the passage of a law that required the government to prepare budgets with limits on deficit spending and indebtedness.The economy grew every year after 1992 (except for the 2008 recession), but it only surpassed a growth rate of 5% of GDP twice before the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately two-thirds of the working population is still employed in the informal sector. However, poverty levels have decreased, and inequality has been somewhat reduced. These improvements have mostly resulted from remittance flows from Salvadorans living abroad rather than redistributive policies. Limited economic growth has created few opportunities for young people entering the job market, along with the criminal violence associated with gangs and organized crime. Most observers agree that social and economic disadvantages are the root causes of the violence problem, which is worsened by the large number of children and young people left to fend for themselves when their caregivers emigrate in search of better opportunities abroad. Although remittances sent back by emigrants offer economic support for some of those left behind, they cannot replace parental figures.Within this environment, successive rounds of electoral campaigns and abundant, unfulfilled promises of better things to come eventually discredited the two main parties and opened the door for an alternative – Nayib Bukele – in the 2019 presidential election. Bukele used extensive social media to broadcast his simple campaign messages: If corruption and violence were ended, there would be sufficient resources and opportunities to resolve all the country's problems. The image he projected was that of a 'non-party' candidate who rejected all those who came before and promised to apply new technologies and honest administration in government to move the country ahead.Successive governments have failed to address the persistent migratory outflows and the continued dependence on remittances as a means of maintaining modest economic growth.

Released as a single two months after the film's premiere, it became a worldwide hit, reaching the Top 10 in several countries. The song became one of Dylan's most popular and most covered post-1960s compositions, spawning covers from Eric Clapton, Guns N' Roses, Randy Crawford, and more. Described by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin as 'an exercise in splendid simplicity', the song features two short verses, the lyrics of which comment directly on the scene in the film for which it was written: the death of a frontier lawman (Slim Pickens) who refers to his wife (Katy Jurado) as 'Mama'. It was ranked number 190 in 2004 by Rolling Stone magazine, in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and number 192 in 2010.

After the recording sessions with Louis, Clapton recorded his own version of the song which was released as a single in August 1975 two weeks after Louis's version. This version was released on Timepieces: The Best of Eric Clapton.

Bush in 1989, Bill Clinton in 1993, George W. Bush in 2001, Barack Obama in 2009, Trump in 2017 and Biden in 2021 — did not give an official State of the Union address their first year in office. That speech would have come soon after their inaugural addresses. However, many of them still gave a major speech to Congress soon after their inauguration. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Each year, before a joint session of Congress, the president fulfills his or her constitutional duty to 'give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union' (Article II, section 3). Presidents George Washington and John Adams delivered their messages in person, but in 1801 Thomas Jefferson chose to send his in writing. That precedent held until Woodrow Wilson decided to deliver his message in person in 1913, a tradition that continues today. Franklin Roosevelt referred to it as the 'State of the Union Address,' a title that became official during the Harry Truman administration. The first national radio broadcast of the message occurred in 1923, following a limited but successful experimentation with radio in 1922. Truman's 1947 address was the first to be televised, and in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson began the tradition of delivering the address in prime time. In 1966 the opposition party began offering a televised response to the president's speech, a tradition that has continued.

how many strong verbs are there in german,NQ,"""There are more than 200 strong and irregular verbs""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> German verbs may be classified as either weak, with a dental consonant inflection, or strong, showing a vowel gradation (ablaut).

where did homer get the name max power,NQ,"""He is delighted with the positive attention he receives because of his name, but when the television character is rewritten from a hero to a bumbling idiot, he is mocked and taunted, so he changes his name to 'Max Power' to rid himself of the negative attention""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> 'Homer to the Max' is the thirteenth episode of the tenth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 7, 1999. In the episode, Homer discovers that a new television show, Police Cops, has a hero also named Homer Simpson. He is delighted with the positive attention he receives because of his name, but when the television character is rewritten from a hero to a bumbling idiot, he is mocked and taunted, so he changes his name to 'Max Power' to rid himself of the negative attention. Max gains new friends, and is forced into a protest to prevent a forest from being knocked down. In the end, he changes his name back to Homer Simpson. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Pete Michels. Since airing, it has received mixed reviews from television critics. Overall, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.5. Plot Following the pilot, however, the Homer Simpson character is rewritten as Lance's overweight and inept comic relief sidekick who mistakes the toys for guns program as 'guns for toys' and the police chief's insulin shipment for illegal drugs. He also spouts the mindless catchphrase 'Uh-oh! SpaghettiOs!', resulting in Homer being mocked by the people of Springfield. Humiliated, he appeals to the producers to change the character back, but they refuse, instead using Homer's plea and incompetent exit as material. Then, after unsuccessfully attempting to sue the company for improper usage of his old name, Homer legally changes his name to 'Max Power', the only correctly spelled or sensible name on the list he presented to the presiding judge. Though the negative attention fades away, Marge is unhappy that Homer changed his name without consulting her. With his new identity comes a massive change in attitude, as Max is much more assertive and freewheeling than Homer was. While shopping at Costington's, Max meets a successful businessman named Trent Steel. Trent invites Max and the family to a garden party, despite Marge's reservations, where they meet many famous people, but Max finds out the party is an excuse to save a redwood forest from destruction. After travelling with the party guests to the forest, Max, Marge, and everyone else chain themselves to the trees to prevent the bulldozers from knocking them down. The Springfield police arrive and Eddie and Lou chase Max around his tree, trying to 'swab' him with mace. As Max rounds the tree, the chain cuts into it. The redwood falls and knocks down all other redwoods, angering their newfound friends. Max later changes his name back to 'Homer Simpson', but attempts to get Marge to agree to change hers into something sexually suggestive such as 'Chesty LaRue', 'Busty St. Claire', or 'Hootie McBoob'. </p>",2025-11-19 13:28:08-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Max gains new friends, and is forced into a protest to prevent a forest from being knocked down. In the end, he changes his name back to Homer Simpson. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Pete Michels. Since airing, it has received mixed reviews from television critics. Overall, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.5. Plot Following the pilot, however, the Homer Simpson character is rewritten as Lance's overweight and inept comic relief sidekick who mistakes the toys for guns program as 'guns for toys' and the police chief's insulin shipment for illegal drugs. He also spouts the mindless catchphrase 'Uh-oh! SpaghettiOs!', resulting in Homer being mocked by the people of Springfield. Humiliated, he appeals to the producers to change the character back, but they refuse, instead using Homer's plea and incompetent exit as material. Then, after unsuccessfully attempting to sue the company for improper usage of his old name, Homer legally changes his name to 'Max Power', the only correctly spelled or sensible name on the list he presented to the presiding judge. Though the negative attention fades away, Marge is unhappy that Homer changed his name without consulting her. With his new identity comes a massive change in attitude, as Max is much more assertive and freewheeling than Homer was. While shopping at Costington's, Max meets a successful businessman named Trent Steel. Trent invites Max and the family to a garden party, despite Marge's reservations, where they meet many famous people, but Max finds out the party is an excuse to save a redwood forest from destruction. After travelling with the party guests to the forest, Max, Marge, and everyone else chain themselves to the trees to prevent the bulldozers from knocking them down. The Springfield police arrive and Eddie and Lou chase Max around his tree, trying to 'swab' him with mace. As Max rounds the tree, the chain cuts into it. The redwood falls and knocks down all other redwoods, angering their newfound friends. Max later changes his name back to 'Homer Simpson', but attempts to get Marge to agree to change hers into something sexually suggestive such as 'Chesty LaRue', 'Busty St. Claire', or 'Hootie McBoob'. </p>",2025-11-19 15:07:35-08:00,False,Response is valid.

At nighttime, Edd wears a yellow onesie and his ever-present hat. Season 5 shows him sleeping with a light blue and white nightcap instead. Edd has three black hairs that stick out of his hat in a similar style to Eddy's, but facing downwards instead of upwards. His two most notable physical features are his big chin (said to be similar to Kevin's), and the gap between his teeth. In the first season, his skin was light yellow, but it progressively became more desert sand-beige. His eye color was shown to be blue-green on the front cover of Ed, Edd n Eddy - The Mis-Edventures. His tongue is a mint-green color. Two frames in 'Fool on the Ed' reveals Edd's eye color to be a light green in the first instance and a very light gold color in the second instance. In the later seasons, Edd wears a yellow tie over his shirt when attending school. When going outside, he wears a brown cardigan with olive drab trimmings. When it is snowing, he wears an orange snow jacket, light green scarf, earmuffs, and purple snow pants with a white stripe on both sides.

The title character of the segment was voiced by Ariela Barer in season one and Caroline Jacobs in season three. Kidrobot made the toy models of the characters that appear at the beginning and end of each episode. The title of the show pays homage to 'Gabba Gabba Hey' by the punk rock band Ramones. History Yo Gabba Gabba! was developed by two Southern California fathers and punk rockers, Christian Jacobs (best known under the stage persona The MC Bat Commander in The Aquabats) and Scott Schultz, who first started working together as teenagers, producing and directing skateboarding videos. Their goal was to design a kids' show that was entertaining while featuring real artists and real performers. Both had no past experience writing scripts for television, let alone children's broadcasting or education. In developing the show they took inspiration from a number of classic children's series including Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Pee-wee's Playhouse, Zoom, as well as Sid and Marty Krofft puppet shows The Banana Splits and H. R. Pufnstuf. </p>",2025-11-20 03:54:59-08:00,False,Response is valid.

In addition, hostile NPCs were introduced in February 2020, which can be fought for additional and (typically) improved items, as well as friendly NPCs in December 2020, which can sell items such as weapons or consumables, or provide services such as acting as bot teammates or healing players. </p>",2025-11-19 13:47:32-08:00,False,Response is valid.

It has remained a useful strategy for students who want to create their own study-guide and useful reference system within their notes. The system requires students to set up their notebook the same way for each day's class. Student's should put their name, course title, date, and lecture topic at the top of each page. As demonstrated in the diagram below, each page will include three components. In-Class Notes: The notes section of the page should be six inches wide and nine inches long. Students should use short, concise sentences and abbreviations. Leave several lines between each item so you can fill them in later with additional material from reading or subsequent lectures. </p>",2025-11-19 12:30:48-08:00,False,Response is valid.

They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it. Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed. Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial 'trade violins' coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker.

Joining them was star virtuoso Leonidas Kavakos in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto (in a reprise of his Symphony Ball performance Sept. 23). The Tchaikovsky favorite led off the concert, which was live-streamed by New York classical-music station WQXR, and was followed by Mussorgsky's Pictures from an Exhibition. Spotted in the opening-night crowd were arts luminaries such as mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, actor-director Liev Schreiber and actress Patricia Clarkson. After the Mussorgsky, Muti addressed the audience and mentioned that the movement The Great Gates of Kiev has taken on added meaning, given the war in Ukraine. He added that he did not intend to be political and wanted to send concertgoers on their way with an encore from Giordani's Fedora, an intermezzo based on the aria 'Amor ti vieta' (the aria itself begins with the words 'Love forbids you not to love'). Muti and the CSO return for a second program Oct. 5 featuring Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, Strauss' Aus Italien and the New York premiere of Philip Glass' The Triumph of the Octagon, a CSO commission that he wrote and dedicated to Maestro Muti.

what is the song in red dead redemption,NQ,"""composed by musicians Bill Elm and Woody Jackson""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Print/export Download as PDFPrintable version Appearance move to sidebar hide From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The music for the 2010 action-adventure western video game Red Dead Redemption, developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games, was composed by musicians Bill Elm and Woody Jackson. Recorded at Jackson's studio in Los Angeles, the soundtracks were produced by David Holmes. The music was intended to imitate soundtracks of 1960s Western films, such as Ennio Morricone's work on the Dollars Trilogy. In collaboration with each other, Elm and Jackson produced over fourteen hours of music across fifteen months. The composers used unconventional instruments to create unique sounds, and worked with artists such as Tommy Morgan during production. Four supplementary vocal recordings were also produced for the game. The soundtrack album for Red Dead Redemption was released on iTunes in May 2010. Additional compositions, composed for the game's standalone expansion pack Undead Nightmare, were released on a second soundtrack in November 2010. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers felt that the music connected appropriately with the gameplay and genre. The game's music was nominated for numerous awards. Several tracks became popular and begot cover versions and live performances. Background and recording Woody Jackson composed the score for Red Dead Redemption, in collaboration with Bill Elm. Red Dead Redemption is one of the first games by Rockstar to use an original score. Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich has cited the large scale of the game as one of the largest difficulties when producing the score. He said that, in order to achieve an effective gaming experience, the game could not solely feature licensed music, like previous Rockstar games. 'We figured we'd need to write an original score,' Pavlovich said. To work on the score, Rockstar engaged Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, member and former member of Friends of Dean Martinez, respectively. In collaboration with each other, the duo composed over fourteen hours of music, which scores the game's missions, across fifteen months. The original score and subsequent album were both recorded and mixed at Jackson's personal recording studio in Los Angeles, and mastered at Capitol Studios. Following the recording, Irish producer and composer David Holmes listened to the original score, and subsequently spent three weeks compiling fifteen instrumental tracks that could be used as standalone songs for the game's official soundtrack. Holmes attempted to make the soundtrack representative of the variety of sounds and moods in the game. Four vocal performances were also recorded for use in the soundtrack.[a] </p>",2025-11-19 14:03:50-08:00,False,Response is valid.

who wrote antigone and what are the dates of his birth and death,NQ,,"<p><b>Source 1:</b> In Greek mythology, Antigone (/ænˈtɪɡəni/ ann-TIG-ə-nee; Ancient Greek: Ἀντιγόνη, romanized: Antigónē) is a Theban princess and a character in several ancient Greek tragedies. She is the daughter of Oedipus, king of Thebes; her mother is either Jocasta or, in another variation of the myth, Euryganeia. She is a sister of Polynices, Eteocles, and Ismene. The meaning of the name is, as in the case of the masculine equivalent Antigonus, 'in place of one's parents' or 'worthy of one's parents'. Antigone appears in the three 5th century BC tragic plays written by Sophocles, known collectively as the three Theban plays, being the protagonist of the eponymous tragedy Antigone. She makes a brief appearance at the end of Aeschylus' Seven against Thebes, while her story was also the subject of Euripides' now lost play with the same name. In Sophocles The story of Antigone was addressed by the fifth-century BC Greek playwright Sophocles in his Theban plays: Oedipus Rex Main article: Oedipus Rex </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Antigone is brought before Creon, and admits that she knew of Creon's law forbidding mourning for Polynices but chose to break it, claiming the superiority of divine over human law, and she defies Creon's cruelty with courage, passion, and determination. Creon orders Antigone buried alive in a tomb. Although Creon has a change of heart, due to a visit from soothsayer Tiresias, and tries to release Antigone, he finds she has hanged herself. Creon's son Haemon, who was engaged to Antigone, commits suicide with a knife, and his mother Queen Eurydice also kills herself in despair over her son's death. She had been forced to weave throughout the entire story, and her death alludes to The Fates. By her death Antigone ends up destroying the household of her adversary, Creon. Other representations In the oldest version of the story, the burial of Polynices takes place during Oedipus' reign in Thebes, before Oedipus marries his mother, Jocasta. However, in other versions such as Sophocles' tragedies Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, it occurs in the years after the banishment and death of Oedipus and Antigone's struggles against Creon.[citation needed] Seven Against Thebes Antigone appears briefly in Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes.[citation needed] Euripides's Lost Play The dramatist Euripides also wrote a play called Antigone, which is lost, but some of the text was preserved by later writers and in passages in his Phoenissae. In Euripides, the calamity is averted by the intercession of Dionysus and is followed by the marriage of Antigone and Hæmon. Antigone also plays a role in the Phoenissae.[citation needed] Appearances Elsewhere </p>",2025-11-19 13:58:22-08:00,True,"The answer is missing one or more double-quotation marks.

Within days the five Great Powers of Europe (Great Britain, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and Russia) were at war. Russia, which had entered the war largely out of a sense of pan-Slavic obligation to Serbia and in the hopes of making gains on the Black Sea coast, was obligated to assist France by treaty.

Hindenburg and Ludendorff had thus out-flanked the Russians yet again; on 11 November, General August von Mackensen (1849-1945) led the Ninth Army up the Vistula and drove a wedge between the Russian First and Second armies in front of Lodz. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Launched on 23 January, the offensive was a disaster.

Entire lines of riflemen surrender in tears to escape the pain.'[5] Although Pflanzer-Baltin captured Czernowitz, Conrad called off the offensive on 8 February, his forces in the Carpathians having suffered over 100,000 casualties. A second attempt at the end of the month fared no better; the Austrian armies lost another 45,000 men in only ten days, including the last of their trained officers.

what is the origin of the phrase going cold turkey,NQ,"""The origin of the phrase 'cold turkey' in the sense of unpleasant withdrawal is a matter of some debate and ambiguity""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (March 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The origin of the phrase 'cold turkey' in the sense of unpleasant withdrawal is a matter of some debate and ambiguity. Reaction to being served cheap meat </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The hypothesis posited by researchers[who?] is that Hume's behavior towards Clara - excluding and excommunicating her in retaliation for her ongoing ill-treatment of him - became known as 'the cold turkey treatment', and that word quickly spread from London to the rest of Britain, and finally the United States. An early print appearance of 'cold turkey' in its exclusionary sense dates to 1910, in Canadian poet Robert W. Service's The Trail of '98: A Northland Romance: 'Once I used to gamble an' drink the limit. One morning I got up from the card-table after sitting there thirty-six hours. I'd lost five thousand dollars. I knew they'd handed me out 'cold turkey'...' 'Talking turkey' Another possible origin relates to the American phrase talk turkey, meaning 'to speak bluntly with little preparation'. The phrase 'taking cold turkey' has also been reported during the 1920s as slang for pleading guilty. Goosebumps </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The problem with both of these theories is that they ignore the uses of cold turkey before its application to drug addiction. In a cartoon that appeared in newspapers on November 12, 1920, ace slangman Thomas 'TAD' Dorgan used cold turkey this way – 'Now tell me on the square – can I get by with this for the wedding – don't string me – tell me cold turkey.' The editors of the Historical Dictionary of American Slang have found an earlier use: a 1910 usage where the speaker lost $5,000 cold turkey, in the sense of losing it outright. It may be that the original cold turkey was a combination of cold ('straightforward, matter-of-fact') and the earlier talk turkey, which dates back to the early 1800s and refers to speaking plainly. Regardless of its ultimate origins, the phrase manages to vividly capture the initial dread and discomfort that comes from immediately quitting something that's addictive, from drugs to dating apps.

difference between document type declaration and document type definition,NQ,"""The HTML layout engines in modern web browsers perform DOCTYPE 'sniffing' or 'switching', wherein the DOCTYPE in a document served as text/html determines a layout mode, such as 'quirks mode' or 'standards mode'""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The HTML layout engines in modern web browsers perform DOCTYPE 'sniffing' or 'switching', wherein the DOCTYPE in a document served as text/html determines a layout mode, such as 'quirks mode' or 'standards mode'. The text/html serialization of HTML5, which is not SGML-based, uses the DOCTYPE only for mode selection. Since web browsers are implemented with special-purpose HTML parsers, rather than general-purpose DTD-based parsers, they do not use DTDs and never access them even if a URL is provided. The DOCTYPE is retained in HTML5 as a 'mostly useless, but required' header only to trigger 'standards mode' in common browsers. Syntax The general syntax for a document type declaration is: &lt;!DOCTYPE root-element PUBLIC '/quotedFPI/' '/quotedURI/' [ &lt;!-- internal subset declarations --&gt; ]&gt; or &lt;!DOCTYPE root-element SYSTEM '/quotedURI/' [ &lt;!-- internal subset declarations --&gt; ]&gt; Document type name The opening &lt;!DOCTYPE syntax is followed by separating syntax: 403–404  (such as spaces,: 297–298, 372  or (except in XML) comments opened and closed by a doubled ASCII hyphen),: 372, 391  followed by a document type name: 403–404  (i.e. the name of the root element that the DTD applies to trees descending from). In XML, the root element that represents the document is the first element in the document. For example, in XHTML, the root element is &lt;html&gt;, being the first element opened (after the doctype declaration) and last closed. Since the syntax for the external identifier and internal subset are both optional,: 403–404  the document type name is the only information which it is mandatory to give in a DOCTYPE declaration. External identifier The DOCTYPE declaration can optionally contain an external identifier, following the root element name (and separating syntax such as spaces), but before any internal subset.: 403–404  This begins with either the keyword SYSTEM or the keyword PUBLIC,: 379  specifying whether the DTD is specified using a public identifier identifying it as a public text, i.e. one shared between multiple computer systems (regardless of whether it is an available public text available to the general public, or an unavailable public text shared only within an organisation).: 180–182  If the PUBLIC keyword is used, it is followed by the public identifier enclosed in double or single ASCII quotation marks. The public identifier does not point to a storage location, but is rather a unique fixed string intended to be looked up in a table (such as an SGML catalog);: 180  however, in some (but not all) SGML profiles, the public identifier must be constructed using a particular syntax called Formal Public Identifier (FPI), which specifies the owner as well as whether it is available to the general public.: 182–183 </p>",2025-11-20 15:40:07-08:00,False,Response is valid.

On 14 May 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected among the 860,000 refugees who lived in Cox's Bazar district. In March 2021, a fire at the refugee camp left 15 dead and some 400 missing and displaced more than 45,000 mostly Rohingya refugees. Geography and climate Cox's Bazar is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the divisional headquarter city of Chittagong. Cox's Bazar town has an area of 6.85 km2 (2.64 sq mi), and is bounded by Bakkhali River on the north and East, Bay of Bengal in the West, and Jhilwanj Union in the south. The beach in Cox's Bazar has a gentle slope and with an unbroken length of 155 km (96 mi) it is often termed the 'longest natural unbroken sea beach' in the world. Cox's Bazar lies on a coastal plain in the southeastern corner of Bangladesh. From above, the plain appears to bulge out into the Bay of Bengal. Along the shore is an extensive area of beach and dunes. Most of the city is built on a floodplain that is lower in elevation than the dunes, making it more susceptible to flooding due to cyclones and storm surges. The Cox's Bazar coastal plain was formed after the sea reached its present level around 6,500 years ago, with the area of the current floodplain originally forming a sediment sink that has since been gradually filled in by the Bakkhali river as well as smaller streams coming down from the hills. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Padre Island on the US Gulf Coast, Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia, and Ninety Mile Beach of Australia.

The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who stars alongside debutant Gracy Singh and British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne. Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of British colonial rule in India, the film follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory. Produced on a budget of ₹25 crore (US$5.3 million), Lagaan was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. It faced multiple challenges during production: Khan was initially skeptical to star in a sports film, and later, prospective producers called for budget cuts and script modifications. Eventually, the film would become the maiden project of Aamir Khan Productions, and mark Khan's foray into film production. Gowariker was inspired by aspects of the sports drama Naya Daur (1957) in developing the film. The language featured in the film was based on Awadhi, but was diluted with standard Hindi for modern audiences. Principal photography took place in villages near Bhuj. Nitin Chandrakant Desai served as art director, while Bhanu Athaiya was the costume designer. The original soundtrack was composed by A. R.

Joining them was star virtuoso Leonidas Kavakos in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto (in a reprise of his Symphony Ball performance Sept. 23). The Tchaikovsky favorite led off the concert, which was live-streamed by New York classical-music station WQXR, and was followed by Mussorgsky's Pictures from an Exhibition. Spotted in the opening-night crowd were arts luminaries such as mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, actor-director Liev Schreiber and actress Patricia Clarkson. After the Mussorgsky, Muti addressed the audience and mentioned that the movement The Great Gates of Kiev has taken on added meaning, given the war in Ukraine. He added that he did not intend to be political and wanted to send concertgoers on their way with an encore from Giordani's Fedora, an intermezzo based on the aria 'Amor ti vieta' (the aria itself begins with the words 'Love forbids you not to love'). Muti and the CSO return for a second program Oct. 5 featuring Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, Strauss' Aus Italien and the New York premiere of Philip Glass' The Triumph of the Octagon, a CSO commission that he wrote and dedicated to Maestro Muti.

Joining them was star virtuoso Leonidas Kavakos in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto (in a reprise of his Symphony Ball performance Sept. 23). The Tchaikovsky favorite led off the concert, which was live-streamed by New York classical-music station WQXR, and was followed by Mussorgsky's Pictures from an Exhibition. Spotted in the opening-night crowd were arts luminaries such as mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, actor-director Liev Schreiber and actress Patricia Clarkson. After the Mussorgsky, Muti addressed the audience and mentioned that the movement The Great Gates of Kiev has taken on added meaning, given the war in Ukraine. He added that he did not intend to be political and wanted to send concertgoers on their way with an encore from Giordani's Fedora, an intermezzo based on the aria 'Amor ti vieta' (the aria itself begins with the words 'Love forbids you not to love'). Muti and the CSO return for a second program Oct. 5 featuring Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, Strauss' Aus Italien and the New York premiere of Philip Glass' The Triumph of the Octagon, a CSO commission that he wrote and dedicated to Maestro Muti.

Recorded at Jackson's studio in Los Angeles, the soundtracks were produced by David Holmes. The music was intended to imitate soundtracks of 1960s Western films, such as Ennio Morricone's work on the Dollars Trilogy. In collaboration with each other, Elm and Jackson produced over fourteen hours of music across fifteen months. The composers used unconventional instruments to create unique sounds, and worked with artists such as Tommy Morgan during production. Four supplementary vocal recordings were also produced for the game. The soundtrack album for Red Dead Redemption was released on iTunes in May 2010. Additional compositions, composed for the game's standalone expansion pack Undead Nightmare, were released on a second soundtrack in November 2010. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers felt that the music connected appropriately with the gameplay and genre. The game's music was nominated for numerous awards. Several tracks became popular and begot cover versions and live performances. Background and recording Woody Jackson composed the score for Red Dead Redemption, in collaboration with Bill Elm. Red Dead Redemption is one of the first games by Rockstar to use an original score. Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich has cited the large scale of the game as one of the largest difficulties when producing the score. He said that, in order to achieve an effective gaming experience, the game could not solely feature licensed music, like previous Rockstar games. 'We figured we'd need to write an original score,' Pavlovich said. To work on the score, Rockstar engaged Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, member and former member of Friends of Dean Martinez, respectively. In collaboration with each other, the duo composed over fourteen hours of music, which scores the game's missions, across fifteen months. The original score and subsequent album were both recorded and mixed at Jackson's personal recording studio in Los Angeles, and mastered at Capitol Studios. Following the recording, Irish producer and composer David Holmes listened to the original score, and subsequently spent three weeks compiling fifteen instrumental tracks that could be used as standalone songs for the game's official soundtrack. Holmes attempted to make the soundtrack representative of the variety of sounds and moods in the game.

Mona also shares that she found Alison's diary among a pile of old DiLaurentis items that the St. Germains had left on the curb, discovering the girls' secrets that only Alison knew. Mona's motivation was to get revenge for Jenna's blindness — she didn't know that Jenna and Alison had planned together to launch the firework. Finally, Mona reveals that Ian Thomas killed Alison, due to Alison giving him an ultimatum to break up with Melissa — an incident Mona read about in Alison's diary. She then gives Spencer a chance to become 'A' alongside her, suggesting that Hanna must not be remembering correctly, but Spencer refuses. The two fight at Floating Man's Quarry and Spencer accidentally pushes Mona, causing her to fall and for her neck to be trapped between the rocks.

He starts dating Spencer in hopes to do this, which works. Alison also pretends to be a famous artist's secretary to ruin Aria's potential career. She attempts to drown Emily in a pool for rejecting her and then murders her girlfriend Jordan which causes Emily to become depressed.

In ''A' Is for Answers', the Liars are under attack by 'A' who shoots Ezra Fitz on the rooftop. However, in the fifth-season premiere, the shooter is revealed to be Shana Fring who attempted to kill Alison but was later shoved off a stage by Aria and died from the impact.

However, for many of us, our anchor memories tell us that it did indeed use to say 'Objects in mirror may be closer than they appear' We remember thinking about the warning and asking ourselves and others when would objects be closer or not closer; what's up with the 'may be'?

Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5 in the human stomach lumen, a level maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase. The parietal cell releases bicarbonate into the bloodstream in the process, which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood, known as an alkaline tide. The acidic gastric juice also contains digestive enzymes produced by other cells in the gastric glands – gastric chief cells. Gastric chief cells secrete an inactivated pepsinogen. Once in the stomach lumen gastric acid activates the proenzyme to pepsin. Gastric acid further inhibits the survival and progress of many pathogens in the stomach Secretion A typical adult human stomach will secrete about 1.5 liters of gastric juice daily. Gastric juice is the combination of gastric gland secretions including the main component of hydrochloric acid (gastric acid), gastric lipase and pepsinogen. Once in the stomach pepsinogen is changed by gastric acid to the digestive enzyme pepsin adding this enzyme to the gastric juice. Gastric acid secretion is produced in several steps. Chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted separately from the cytoplasm of parietal cells and mixed in the canaliculi. This creates a negative potential of between −40 and −70 mV across the parietal cell membrane that causes potassium ions and a small number of sodium ions to diffuse from the cytoplasm into the parietal cell canaliculi.

In a well-designed database, each table stores data about a particular subject, such as employees or products. A table has records (rows) and fields (columns). Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks. A record: Contains specific data, like information about a particular employee or a product. A field: Contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address. A field value: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com. Top of Page Table and field properties Tables and fields also have properties that you can set to control their characteristics or behavior. 1. Table properties 2. Field properties In an Access database, table properties are attributes of a table that affect the appearance or behavior of the table as a whole. Table properties are set in the table's property sheet, in Design view. For example, you can set a table's Default View property to specify how the table is displayed by default. A field property applies to a particular field in a table and defines one of the field's characteristics or an aspect of the field's behavior. You can set some field properties in Datasheet view. You can also set any field property in Design view by using the Field Properties pane. Data types Every field has a data type. A field's data type indicates the kind of data that the field stores, such as large amounts of text or attached files. A data type is a field property, but it differs from other field properties as follows: You set a field's data type in the table design grid, not in the Field Properties pane. A field's data type determines what other properties the field has. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Primary key    A table can have only one primary key. A primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record that you store in the table. Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of the Customers table.

He was created by Dick Wolf and Michael S. Chernuchin and has been portrayed by Sam Waterston during the show's original run from 1994 to 2010 and again from 2022 until his retirement in 2024. He is the longest-tenured character on the show, appearing in 19 seasons. He has appeared in 405 episodes of Law & Order, four episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, two episodes of Law & Order: Trial by Jury, two episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street, and the made-for-TV movie Exiled.[citation needed] Waterston's performance as McCoy on the New York–based series was so popular that it resulted in him being declared a 'Living Landmark' by the New York Landmarks Conservancy, along with fellow longtime series cast member Jerry Orbach (who portrayed the popular police detective Lennie Briscoe for almost 12 years). Character overview McCoy is introduced as Executive Assistant District Attorney by Adam Schiff (Steven Hill) in the season five premiere episode 'Second Opinion'. He has been nicknamed 'Hang 'em High McCoy'. He describes himself as a 'junkyard dog'. He is well-respected in the legal community, once referred to as 'the top of the legal food chain' by a rival attorney during a trial.

However, McCoy was the DA again as of 2018, showing up in the SVU episode 'The Undiscovered Country'.
