An electrical current produced by a radio wave is used to heat up a small area of nerve tissue, thereby decreasing pain signals from that specific area. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } RFA can be used to help patients with chronic (long-lasting) low-back and neck pain and pain related to the degeneration of joints from arthritis. The degree of pain relief varies, depending on the cause and location of the pain. Pain relief from RFA can last from six to 12 months and in some cases, relief can last for years. More than 70% of patients treated with RFA experience pain relief. RFA has proven to be a safe and effective way to treat some forms of pain. It also is generally well-tolerated, with very few associated complications. There is a slight risk of infection and bleeding at the insertion site. Your doctor can advise you about your particular risk. The main side effect of RFA is some discomfort, including swelling and bruising at the site of the treatment, but this generally goes away after a few days. As with any medical procedure, RFA is not appropriate for everyone. For example, radiofrequency ablation is not recommended for people who have active infections or bleeding problems. Your doctor can tell you if you should not have RFA. To prepare for radiofrequency ablation treatment, you should take a few precautions, including: Do not eat within six hours of your appointment; however, you may have clear liquids until two hours before the procedure. If you have diabetes and use insulin, you must adjust the dosage of insulin the day of the procedure. Your primary care doctor will help you with this adjustment. Bring your diabetes medication with you so you can take it after the procedure. Continue to take all other medications with a small sip of water. Bring all medication with you so you can take it after the procedure. Please note: Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor. You will need to bring someone with you to drive you home after the procedure. You should not drive or operate machinery for at least 24 hours after the procedure. You will meet with a doctor for an evaluation. If radiofrequency ablation is recommended, a doctor will explain the procedure in detail, including possible complications and side effects. The doctor will also answer any questions you may have. An intravenous ( IV) line may be placed in a vein in your arm before the procedure and a local anesthetic and mild sedative may be used to reduce any discomfort during RFA. You may be awake during the process to aid in properly assessing the procedure. Ask your doctor about specifics beforehand. After the local anesthesia (you will be awake but will not feel any pain) has been given, the doctor will insert a small needle into the general area where you are experiencing pain. Using X-ray, your doctor will guide the needle to the exact target area. A microelectrode is then inserted through the needle to begin the stimulation process. During the procedure, your doctor will ask if you are able to feel a tingling sensation. The object of the stimulation process is to help the doctor determine if the electrode is in the optimal area for treatment. Once the needle and electrode placement are verified, a small radiofrequency current is sent through the electrode into the surrounding tissue, causing the tissue to heat. You should not feel discomfort during the heating portion of the procedure. Following radiofrequency ablation: You will stay in a recovery room for observation, where a nurse will check your blood pressure and pulse. A bandage will be placed over the injection site. The nurse will give you a beverage and review your discharge instructions with you. Someone must drive you home. You will have a few restrictions immediately following radiofrequency ablation: Do not drive or operate machinery for at least 24 hours after the procedure. You may resume your normal diet. Do not engage in any strenuous activity for the first 24 hours after the procedure. Do not take a bath for one to two days after the procedure; you may shower. You may remove any bandages in the evening before going to bed. You may experience the following effects after RFA: Leg numbness: If you have any leg numbness, walk only with assistance. This should only last a few hours and is due to the local anesthesia given during the procedure. Mild back discomfort: This may occur when the local anesthetic wears off and usually lasts two or three days. Apply ice to the area the day of the procedure and moist heat the day after the procedure if the discomfort persists. You may also use your usual pain medications. If you feel severe pain at the injection site and notice swelling and redness, or increased leg weakness, have someone take you to the nearest emergency room or call 911. Tell the emergency room staff that you just had RFA. A doctor must evaluate you for bleeding and injection complications.</p>",2025-11-20 15:17:36-08:00,False,Response is valid.

How can I remove mucus in a very young and congested child?,MASH,"""If you have a very young child with congestion, use a nasal bulb to remove mucus""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> It's not always easy to tell your child has the flu. The illness comes on fast and is more intense than a cold. Kids tend to feel worse during the first 2 or 3 days they're sick. Symptoms include: A high-grade fever up to 104 degrees F Chills and shakes with the fever Extreme tiredness Headache and body aches Dry, hacking cough Sore throat Vomiting and belly pain Some parents mistake the flu for a stomach bug. That's because unlike adults, children with the flu can have nausea, stomach pain, and vomiting. Three main types of influenza viruses can give you the flu. Types A and B cause the yearly outbreaks. Type C leads to mild, random cases. The flu is highly contagious, particularly when kids share close quarters like they do in school classrooms. It spreads when they inhale droplets that are coughed up or sneezed by an infected person, or when they come in direct contact with mucus or spit from someone who has the flu. Kids can spread the flu a day before their symptoms start, and 5-7 days after they get sick. It can easily move from kid to kid as they share things like pencils, toys, computers, remotes, spoons, and forks. Hand-to-hand contact is another main method. The best way is to get a yearly vaccination. The CDC says all people 6 months and older should get one. Pregnant women and caregivers of children younger than 6 months or of children with certain health conditions should get the vaccine. Yes. Those can include a sinus infection, ear infection, or pneumonia. Call the doctor if your child's fever lasts more than 3 to 4 days. Also call if she complains of trouble breathing, ear pain, a stuffy nose or head, a cough that won't go away, or she seems to be getting worse. Young children under age 2 -- even healthy children -- are more likely than older children to be hospitalized from the complications of the flu. If the doctor thinks your child is likely to have a complication from the flu, he may give her antiviral medicines like baloxavir marboxil ( Xofluza), oseltamivir ( Tamiflu) or zanamivir ( Relenza). They can help if she gets them in the first 2 days of getting sick. They may even shorten the flu by 1 or 2 days. In some cases, they can prevent it. They stop the virus from reproducing, so it can't spread. Still, the best way to prevent the flu is to get the vaccine. Antibiotic drugs don't work.

It spreads when they inhale droplets that are coughed up or sneezed by an infected person, or when they come in direct contact with mucus or spit from someone who has the flu. Kids can spread the flu a day before their symptoms start, and 5-7 days after they get sick. It can easily move from kid to kid as they share things like pencils, toys, computers, remotes, spoons, and forks. Hand-to-hand contact is another main method.

What can I do to help my baby talk?,MASH,"""your baby's speech development depends on your 'baby talk' skills as well as your baby's.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Before babies learn to talk in a real language -- English, say, or Spanish -- they babble and coo, playing with sound. That's baby talk, and baby talk sounds similar the world over. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } But when will you hear your baby's first words? Critical milestones for a baby learning to talk happen in the first three years of life, when a baby's brain is rapidly developing. During that time, your baby's speech development depends on your 'baby talk' skills as well as your baby's. The first 'baby talk' is nonverbal and happens soon after birth. Your baby grimaces, cries, and squirms to express a range of emotions and physical needs, from fear and hunger to frustration and sensory overload. Good parents learn to listen and interpret their baby's different cries. Just when your baby will say those magical first words varies greatly from individual baby to individual baby. But if your baby misses any of the following milestones in speech development, talk to your pediatrician or family doctor about your concerns. Baby Talk Milestones Baby talk at 3 months. At 3 months, your baby listens to your voice, watches your face as you talk, and turns toward other voices, sounds, and music that can be heard around the home. Many infants prefer a woman's voice over a man's. Many also prefer voices and music they heard while they were still in the womb. By the end of three months, babies begin 'cooing' -- a happy, gentle, repetitive, sing-song vocalization. Baby talk at 6 months. At 6 months, your baby begins babbling with different sounds. For example, your baby may say 'ba-ba' or 'da-da.' By the end of the sixth or seventh month, babies respond to their own names, recognize their native language, and use their tone of voice to tell you they're happy or upset. Some eager parents interpret a string of 'da-da' babbles as their baby's first words -- 'daddy!' But babbling at this age is usually still made up of random syllables without real meaning or comprehension. Baby talk at 9 months. After 9 months, babies can understand a few basic words like 'no' and 'bye-bye.' They also may begin to use a wider range of consonant sounds and tones of voice. Baby talk at 12-18 months. Most babies say a few simple words like 'mama' and 'dadda' by the end of 12 months -- and now know what they're saying. They respond to -- or at least understand, if not obey -- your short, one-step requests such as, ' Please put that down.' Baby talk at 18 months. Babies at this age say several simple words and can point to people, objects, and body parts you name for them. They repeat words or sounds they hear you say, like the last word in a sentence. But they often leave off endings or beginnings of words. For example, they may say 'daw' for 'dog' or 'noo-noo's' for 'noodles.' Baby talk at 2 years. By age 2, babies string together a few words in short phrases of two to four words, such as ' Mommy bye-bye' or 'me milk.' They're learning that words mean more than objects like 'cup' -- they also mean abstract ideas like 'mine.' Baby talk at 3 years. By the time your baby is age 3, his or her vocabulary expands rapidly, and 'make-believe' play spurs an understanding of symbolic and abstract language like 'now,' feelings like 'sad,' and spatial concepts like 'in.' Babies understand what you're saying long before they can clearly speak. Many babies learning to talk use only one or two words at first, even when they understand 25 or more. You can help your baby learn to talk if you: Watch. Your baby may reach both arms up to say she wants to be picked up, hand you a toy to say she wants to play, or push food off her plate to say she's had enough. Smile, make eye contact, and respond to encourage these early, nonverbal attempts at baby talk. Listen. Pay attention to your baby's cooing and babbling, and coo and babble those same sounds right back to your baby. Babies try to imitate sounds their parents are making and to vary pitch and tone to match the language heard around them. So be patient and give your baby lots of time to 'talk' to you. Praise. Smile and applaud even the smallest or most confusing attempts at baby talk. Babies learn the power of speech by the reactions of adults around them. Imitate. Babies love to hear their parents' voices. And when parents talk to them it helps speech develop. The more you talk their 'baby talk' with them, using short, simple but correct words, such as 'dog' when your baby says 'daw,' the more babies will keep trying to talk. Elaborate. If your baby points to the table and makes noise, don't just give him more noodles. Instead, point to the noodles and say, ' Do you want some more noodles? These noodles taste good with cheese, don't they?' Narrate. Talk about what you're doing as you wash, dress, feed, and change your baby -- ' Let's put on these blue socks now' or ' I'm cutting up your chicken for you' -- so your baby connects your speech to these objects and experiences. Hang in there. Even when you don't understand what your baby is saying, keep trying. Gently repeat back what you think is being said, and ask if that's right. Keep offering your loving attention so your baby feels rewarded for trying to talk. Let your child lead. During playtime, follow your child's attention and interests to show that communication is a two-way game of talking and listening, leading, and following. Play. Encourage children to play, pretend, and imagine out loud to develop verbal skills as they become toddlers. Read aloud. Lifelong readers come from young children who have plenty of fun, relaxing experiences of being read to out loud. Watch for any sign of a major speech delay in your baby, and talk with your doctor if you sense there's a problem. A speech delay can happen for a number of reasons, but the earlier a speech problem in babies is diagnosed, the more time you'll have to correct it and help your child reach his or her full potential before school age. After consulting with your pediatrician, here are things to do to help with delayed speech: Have a hearing test done. As many as three out of 1,000 newborns have hearing loss, which can cause delayed speech development. Most states require a hearing screening in the hospital right after birth. Take your baby in for a full hearing exam by age 3 months if he or she doesn't pass the initial hearing screening. See a speech-language pathologist. A SLP can diagnose and treat specific speech, language, or voice disorders that delay speech. Treatment may include giving parents tips and games to improve speech problems in babies and improve a child's language skills. Consider developmental screening. Up to 17% of children in the U. S. have a developmental or behavioral disability such as autism spectrum disorder or cognitive disability. Ask your baby's doctor about screening for these developmental problems, which can cause speech delays. What's the first step for babies learning to talk?

Critical milestones for a baby learning to talk happen in the first three years of life, when a baby's brain is rapidly developing. During that time, your baby's speech development depends on your 'baby talk' skills as well as your baby's. The first 'baby talk' is nonverbal and happens soon after birth. Your baby grimaces, cries, and squirms to express a range of emotions and physical needs, from fear and hunger to frustration and sensory overload. Good parents learn to listen and interpret their baby's different cries. Just when your baby will say those magical first words varies greatly from individual baby to individual baby. But if your baby misses any of the following milestones in speech development, talk to your pediatrician or family doctor about your concerns. Baby Talk Milestones Baby talk at 3 months. At 3 months, your baby listens to your voice, watches your face as you talk, and turns toward other voices, sounds, and music that can be heard around the home. Many infants prefer a woman's voice over a man's. Many also prefer voices and music they heard while they were still in the womb. By the end of three months, babies begin 'cooing' -- a happy, gentle, repetitive, sing-song vocalization. Baby talk at 6 months. At 6 months, your baby begins babbling with different sounds. For example, your baby may say 'ba-ba' or 'da-da.' By the end of the sixth or seventh month, babies respond to their own names, recognize their native language, and use their tone of voice to tell you they're happy or upset. Some eager parents interpret a string of 'da-da' babbles as their baby's first words -- 'daddy!' But babbling at this age is usually still made up of random syllables without real meaning or comprehension. Baby talk at 9 months. After 9 months, babies can understand a few basic words like 'no' and 'bye-bye.' They also may begin to use a wider range of consonant sounds and tones of voice. Baby talk at 12-18 months. Most babies say a few simple words like 'mama' and 'dadda' by the end of 12 months -- and now know what they're saying. They respond to -- or at least understand, if not obey -- your short, one-step requests such as, ' Please put that down.' Baby talk at 18 months. Babies at this age say several simple words and can point to people, objects, and body parts you name for them. They repeat words or sounds they hear you say, like the last word in a sentence. But they often leave off endings or beginnings of words. For example, they may say 'daw' for 'dog' or 'noo-noo's' for 'noodles.' Baby talk at 2 years. By age 2, babies string together a few words in short phrases of two to four words, such as ' Mommy bye-bye' or 'me milk.' They're learning that words mean more than objects like 'cup' -- they also mean abstract ideas like 'mine.' Baby talk at 3 years. By the time your baby is age 3, his or her vocabulary expands rapidly, and 'make-believe' play spurs an understanding of symbolic and abstract language like 'now,' feelings like 'sad,' and spatial concepts like 'in.' Babies understand what you're saying long before they can clearly speak. Many babies learning to talk use only one or two words at first, even when they understand 25 or more. You can help your baby learn to talk if you: Watch. Your baby may reach both arms up to say she wants to be picked up, hand you a toy to say she wants to play, or push food off her plate to say she's had enough. Smile, make eye contact, and respond to encourage these early, nonverbal attempts at baby talk. Listen. Pay attention to your baby's cooing and babbling, and coo and babble those same sounds right back to your baby. Babies try to imitate sounds their parents are making and to vary pitch and tone to match the language heard around them. So be patient and give your baby lots of time to 'talk' to you. Praise. Smile and applaud even the smallest or most confusing attempts at baby talk. Babies learn the power of speech by the reactions of adults around them. Imitate. Babies love to hear their parents' voices. And when parents talk to them it helps speech develop. The more you talk their 'baby talk' with them, using short, simple but correct words, such as 'dog' when your baby says 'daw,' the more babies will keep trying to talk. Elaborate. If your baby points to the table and makes noise, don't just give him more noodles. Instead, point to the noodles and say, ' Do you want some more noodles? These noodles taste good with cheese, don't they?' Narrate. Talk about what you're doing as you wash, dress, feed, and change your baby -- ' Let's put on these blue socks now' or ' I'm cutting up your chicken for you' -- so your baby connects your speech to these objects and experiences. Hang in there. Even when you don't understand what your baby is saying, keep trying. Gently repeat back what you think is being said, and ask if that's right. Keep offering your loving attention so your baby feels rewarded for trying to talk. Let your child lead. During playtime, follow your child's attention and interests to show that communication is a two-way game of talking and listening, leading, and following. Play. Encourage children to play, pretend, and imagine out loud to develop verbal skills as they become toddlers. Read aloud. Lifelong readers come from young children who have plenty of fun, relaxing experiences of being read to out loud. Watch for any sign of a major speech delay in your baby, and talk with your doctor if you sense there's a problem.

Sure, you feel sneezy and drippy now, but you feel confident you'll be out of the woods in a few days, maybe a few weeks at most. If you have an ongoing medical condition, though, you need to take extra precautions. Getting sick can make your health problems worse. It's a 'chronic,' or long-term, lung disease that affects about 24 million Americans. If you have it, a cold can make your symptoms worse. You might find it harder to breathe. Also, some medications, like antihistamines, can thicken mucus, making it harder to cough up when you have asthma. For in-depth information, see Asthma and Colds. If you have complications from your cold, such as lung infections, it makes it hard to take in oxygen efficiently. When that happens, your heart works even harder to pump oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. For in-depth information, see Heart Disease and Colds. It makes it harder for you to ward off a cold virus. Also, when you get sick, it adds extra stress to your body. This can affect your blood sugar levels, so it's important to take steps to keep them in a good range. For in-depth information, see Diabetes and Colds. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis affect about 11 million adults in the U. S.

Fight back by keeping your hands clean. Don't touch your face. Viruses enter your body through your eyes, nose, and mouth. Keep your hands away from those areas to avoid a cold. Move regularly. Aerobic exercise, which gets your heart pounding, helps increase your body's natural virus-killing cells and helps you fight off a cold. If you've got a long-term medical condition, talk to your doctor before you start a program of physical activity. Eat healthy. Make sure your diet includes foods with lots of nutrients, like dark green, red, and yellow vegetables and fruits.

There's some evidence that when you relax, your immune system gets stronger. Take time to learn how, and use those techniques throughout your day.

What can I do to keep my kids from becoming hyper from sugar?,MASH,"""Research does show that refined sugar and carbohydrates can affect your child's activity level.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> You may wonder if there's something besides medicine or behavior therapy you can do to help your child with ADHD. Can unconventional treatments work? Alternative treatments for ADHD include elimination diets, supplementation with omegas 3s, parent training, neurofeedback, and memory training. Here's what may work and what's unproven. There's a lot of controversy about sugar and ADHD symptoms. Does it lead to hyperactivity? There is no proof that sugar causes ADHD. Then why do kids seem so hyper if they eat a lot of sugar? Research does show that refined sugar and carbohydrates can affect your child's activity level. Kids can feel a rush because refined sugar quickly enters the bloodstream. That boosts blood sugar fast. When blood sugar spikes, your child may become much more active. The burst of energy is from an adrenaline rush caused by the rise in blood sugar. So what can you do? Nutritionists say to add more fiber to your child's diet to help keep blood sugar levels even. High-fiber foods include berries and other fruits, whole grains, and oatmeal. Years ago, Ben Feingold, MD, an allergist, created a popular elimination diet designed to treat hyperactivity. With elimination diets for ADHD, you take certain foods out of your child's diet to see if they affect your child's behavior. The Feingold Diet cuts out artificial colorings, flavorings, and preservatives to decrease hyperactivity. While most scientific studies have disproved Feingold's theory, some parents who have tried it say they noticed an improvement in their child's behavior. But some experts don't think it's the changes in what the children eat that makes a difference. A popular theory is that the child's behavior improves because the parents treat their child differently when they're on the special diet. If you decide to try an elimination diet for ADHD, be careful. You don't want to hurt your child's overall nutrition and have them miss out on important vitamins or minerals. Don't be too restrictive. It's best to talk with your child's doctor before trying any ADHD treatment. She can help you make a healthy eating plan for your child. Or she can refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you with a meal plan and snack ideas. It's important to consider what your child will be able to eat when he or she is away from home, like at school, a birthday party, summer camp, or a friend's house. This can make a restrictive diet harder to follow. Also, consider whether the whole family, including siblings, will follow the same restrictions. One nutrition move that has shown promise is taking omega-3 supplements. Research has shown that children with ADHD have lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood than the typical child. As a result, some doctors recommend that they take omega-3 supplements. Children who were given omega-3s showed a small improvement in how severe their symptoms were when compared to children who took a placebo. The FDA has approved Vayarin, a 'medical food' containing omega-3s, for treating ADHD. Research has shown that children as young as preschool-age can benefit from behavior programs. Programs that involve parents have the best success. Some chiropractors believe that chiropractic medicine can treat ADHD. But no research has been done to see if it works. Many ADHD doctors do not support it. One theory is that an imbalance in muscle tone causes an imbalance in brain activity. According to this theory, when chiropractors adjust the ADHD patient's spine, balance is restored in the brain. The children are also exposed to different light and sound frequencies. Applied kinesiology, or neural organization technique, is another theory some chiropractors use with people who have ADHD. It's based on the thought that the bones of the skull can become misaligned, causing unequal pressure on different parts of the brain. They say this causes the brain to work improperly. To treat it, the chiropractor does adjustments that put the skull bones back to their proper position. But most doctors believe the bones of the skull do not move, so they cannot be misaligned. Neurofeedback teaches a person with ADHD how to change brain waves to focus better. Scientists can study these to look for patterns. There are four waves the brain makes: alpha (medium), beta (fast), theta (slow), and delta (deep sleep). Neurofeedback is based on findings that people with ADHD have more theta waves than other people. They also have fewer beta waves. Supporters believe that training the brain to increase the fast beta waves and decrease the slow theta waves can lower ADHD symptoms. To train them, a medical professional watches the brain waves of the person with ADHD. When their brainwaves reach the right frequency, the health professional lets them know. Through training and practice, they can ultimately learn how to change brain waves on their own. While there has been some promising research in this area, more research is needed to see how well neurofeedback works on ADHD symptoms. A big drawback is the high cost of the treatment. Working Memory Training ( COGMED) Many people with ADHD have trouble with working memory. That's remembering information and doing things with it over a short amount of time. Using computer programs to do brain training seems to help people improve their ability to concentrate, control impulsive behaviors, and improve problem-solving skills. Several studies seem to point to some programs making a difference over the short term. But other studies suggest that maybe only visual memory skills can be improved.</p>",2025-11-20 15:31:57-08:00,False,Response is valid.
What can I do to keep my kids from becoming hyper from sugar?,MASH,"""Nutritionists say to add more fiber to your child's diet to help keep blood sugar levels even. High-fiber foods include berries and other fruits, whole grains, and oatmeal"". ","<p><b>Source 1:</b> You may wonder if there's something besides medicine or behavior therapy you can do to help your child with ADHD. Can unconventional treatments work? Alternative treatments for ADHD include elimination diets, supplementation with omegas 3s, parent training, neurofeedback, and memory training. Here's what may work and what's unproven. There's a lot of controversy about sugar and ADHD symptoms. Does it lead to hyperactivity? There is no proof that sugar causes ADHD. Then why do kids seem so hyper if they eat a lot of sugar? Research does show that refined sugar and carbohydrates can affect your child's activity level. Kids can feel a rush because refined sugar quickly enters the bloodstream. That boosts blood sugar fast. When blood sugar spikes, your child may become much more active. The burst of energy is from an adrenaline rush caused by the rise in blood sugar. So what can you do? Nutritionists say to add more fiber to your child's diet to help keep blood sugar levels even. High-fiber foods include berries and other fruits, whole grains, and oatmeal. Years ago, Ben Feingold, MD, an allergist, created a popular elimination diet designed to treat hyperactivity. With elimination diets for ADHD, you take certain foods out of your child's diet to see if they affect your child's behavior. The Feingold Diet cuts out artificial colorings, flavorings, and preservatives to decrease hyperactivity. While most scientific studies have disproved Feingold's theory, some parents who have tried it say they noticed an improvement in their child's behavior. But some experts don't think it's the changes in what the children eat that makes a difference. A popular theory is that the child's behavior improves because the parents treat their child differently when they're on the special diet. If you decide to try an elimination diet for ADHD, be careful. You don't want to hurt your child's overall nutrition and have them miss out on important vitamins or minerals. Don't be too restrictive. It's best to talk with your child's doctor before trying any ADHD treatment. She can help you make a healthy eating plan for your child. Or she can refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you with a meal plan and snack ideas. It's important to consider what your child will be able to eat when he or she is away from home, like at school, a birthday party, summer camp, or a friend's house. This can make a restrictive diet harder to follow. Also, consider whether the whole family, including siblings, will follow the same restrictions. One nutrition move that has shown promise is taking omega-3 supplements. Research has shown that children with ADHD have lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood than the typical child. As a result, some doctors recommend that they take omega-3 supplements. Children who were given omega-3s showed a small improvement in how severe their symptoms were when compared to children who took a placebo. The FDA has approved Vayarin, a 'medical food' containing omega-3s, for treating ADHD. Research has shown that children as young as preschool-age can benefit from behavior programs.

All the things they do with their mouths -- groom, kiss, wrestle, and other social habits -- can pass along unwanted guests to playmates and companions, canine and human alike. Parasites worm their way into most dogs' lives at one time or another. Your vet may suspect worms if your dog has diarrhea or is vomiting, coughing, chewing or licking under his tail, short of breath, or losing weight. The symptoms and treatments depend on the type of worm and where it's living in your dog's body. Most worms that infect dogs -- including roundworms, tapeworms, hookworms, and whipworms -- live in the intestines, so that's the first place for your vet to look. If it's time for your dog's annual check-up, or if you or your vet thinks your dog has worms, provide a fresh stool sample. Simply scoop up some of your pet's poop, seal it in a clean plastic bag, and bring it to the appointment. If you can't do that, your vet can take a sample during the office visit. He'll check it under a microscope to see if it has worms or worm eggs, and, if so, what kind. Heartworms are another type of canine invader that can cause serious health problems or sometimes even death. These foot-long worms live in the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Mosquitoes carry the worms' offspring from one dog's blood to another's. The vet will do a blood test to tell if your dog has heartworms. There are many safe ways to de-worm your dog. The sooner the worms are gone, the sooner your pet will get healthy and feel better. Your vet will give your dog medicine by mouth or in a shot to kill the worms. Many of these drugs are described as 'broad-spectrum,' because they're good for treating a wide range of parasites, including worms that live in the gut. They're poisonous to pests, but safe for pets. Because worms are so common in puppies, vets recommend de-worming them for the first time when they're 2 to 3 weeks old. Worms can pass from mother to baby before birth or soon after, through her milk. It will take more than one dose. The first round kills the worms that are there at the time. The second kills those that hatch a few weeks later. Rarely, your vet may want to give your puppy blood, because hookworms drain blood from the wall of the intestines, which can cause anemia. Treatment is much the same for adult dogs with worms. The same kinds of drugs are used, but your dog will get more of the medicine. If your dog has heartworms, your vet will need to do blood work, take X-rays, and maybe do other tests to see how serious the infection is. Just the tests can cost $1,000 or more, but they're necessary. Initially, your dog will be started on monthly heartworm prevention along with an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory. A month later, the heartworm treatment starts. This is a strong medicine that should only be given by a vet. Typically, your dog gets a series of three shots over a 2-month period. But that's not the end of the treatment. You'll need to keep your dog calm and quiet for several months after the shots. When heartworms die they break into pieces. These chunks can block blood from flowing to the heart or lungs. When that happens -- and there is a greater chance when blood pumps harder, such as during exercise -- a dog could die. Your vet will give you tips to make sure your sick dog gets rest so he can recover safely. Six months after the heartworm treatment, your vet will do a blood test to check for worms. If they're still there, your dog will need another round of shots. If they're all gone, you continue the preventive medicine for the rest of your dog's life and test for heartworms each year.

How often should I get my eyes checked?,MASH,"""If you're younger than 40 and have no eye problems, your doctor might suggest you get routine tests every 2 years.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> It depends in part on your age and also on your eyes and family. If you're younger than 40 and have no eye problems, your doctor might suggest you get routine tests every 2 years. Or he could tell you that you don't need any tests. Ask what he thinks is best for you. If you're 40 or older, you should get your eyes checked every 1 to 2 years. If you've had eye trouble in the past, or if you're at risk for developing it (if someone in your family had it), you should see an eye doctor every year. Why? You need to check to see if you have serious, sometimes 'silent' problems that can affect your vision, like: Glaucoma Age-related macular degeneration Cataracts Diabetic retinopathy If your child has no risk factors for eye problems, she should get her vision checked as a newborn and again at every regular health visit. By the time she's 3, it will be easier for the doctor to assess her eyes. After the first grade, she should get eye tests every 1 to 2 years. If you have a health condition like high blood pressure, work in a job that requires you to use your eyes a lot, or take drugs that can affect eyesight, you may need more frequent exams. If you have type 1 diabetes, get your eyes checked within 5 years of your diagnosis and every year after that. You'll need an exam ASAP if you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Have your eyes checked every year after that. When you call to make an appointment for your exam, mention any vision problem you're having. Before you go, list any questions you want to ask the doctor. Also be ready to update him or her on any medicines you take and your (and your family's) eye health history. Bring your glasses and contact lenses along with the prescription with you. Also bring sunglasses for the trip home. The doctor might use eye drops to open up your pupils. This is called dilation. Your eyes will be sensitive to light afterward. First, the eye doctor or an office staff member will ask you about your medical and vision history. The exam may last from half an hour to several hours, depending on the equipment used. It will cover your vision and your eye health. You'll probably have all or most of the following eye tests, and possibly some other ones, too: Eye muscle movement test: This checks your eyes' alignment. The doctor will watch your eyes move while you follow a target (like a finger tip or his pen) as it moves in different directions. Cover test: This tells how well your eyes work together. You'll stare at a small target some distance away. The doctor will cover and uncover each eye to observe how much your eyes move. Your doctor will also be watching for an eye that turns away from the target. This is a condition called strabismus. You may take the test again with a target close to you. External exam and pupil reactions: The doctor will watch how your pupils adjust to light and objects close to you. At the same time, the whites of your eyes and the position of your eyelids will also be checked. Visual acuity test: You'll sit in front of an eye chart, with letters that get smaller as you read down each line. You'll cover each eye in turn and, using the other eye, read aloud, going down the chart, until you can't read the letters anymore. Refraction testing: For your exact lens prescription, the doctor can use a computerized refractor. Your doctor may fine-tune the prescription by flipping the phoropter back and forth between lenses and asking you which is better. If you don't need corrective lenses, you won't have this test. Slit lamp (biomicroscope): This device magnifies and lights up the front of your eye. The doctor uses it to check your cornea, iris, lens, and the back of your eye, looking for signs of certain eye conditions. Retinal examination ( ophthalmoscopy ): Your doctor may dilate your pupils and use a tool called an ophthalmoscope and to see the back of your eyes -- the retina, retinal blood vessels, fluid in your eyes (he may call this vitreous fluid), and the head of your optic nerve. Glaucoma testing: This procedure checks to see if the fluid pressure inside your eyes is within a normal range. It's fast, painless, and can be done in a couple of ways: Tonometer: This is the most accurate. You'll get drops to numb your eyes. The doctor will tell you to stare straight ahead and will barely touch the front surface of each eye with a tool called an applanation tonometer or Tonopen to measure the pressure. Puff of air or noncontact tonometer: You'll stare at a target, and a machine will let out a small puff of air into each eye. How much your eye resists the puff indicates the pressure inside it. Pachymetry: This test uses ultrasound to measure the thickness of your cornea. Thin corneas can lead to false low-pressure readings. Thick corneas can lead to false high-pressure readings. You'll get this test just once to create a baseline for comparison with future readings. It can be used for people who need corneal surgery. Pupil dilation (enlargement): With your pupils fully enlarged, the doctor will use tools and lights to check the insides of your eyes. The eye drops for this part of the exam take about 20-30 minutes to work. They make your eyes more sensitive to light and blur your vision. These effects may last for several hours or longer. This is why you might need those sunglasses on your way home. Newer machine can look in the far back of your retina without your pupils being dilated. Visual field test (perimetry): Your visual field is the area you can see in front of you without moving your eyes. Using one of three tests, the eye doctor maps what you see at the edges (periphery) of your visual field and will use this map to diagnose eye conditions. Ask family or friends who they use. Ask your family doctor for a referral. Call the ophthalmology or optometry department of a nearby hospital and ask about doctors who practice there. Contact state and county academies, associations, or societies of optometrists and ophthalmologists, and ask if they can help you. Get a list from your health plan or health insurance company.</p>",2025-11-25 04:46:14-08:00,False,Response is valid.

When should I call my doctor about the color of my baby's bowel movements?,MASH,"""But the pediatrician can test your baby's poop to see if it has blood. You don't need to worry about green, orange, and yellow stools. They are par for the course and rarely a sign of a digestive problem.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> If you're a new parent, you might think about your baby's poop more than you ever thought you would. Different colors and textures pop up all the time. How do you know if they're normal or a sign of a problem? Get a handle on the basics to get you through this stage in your baby's life. Your baby's first poops are called meconium. It's a thick and sticky residue that is greenish-black in color. You should see it only in the first 3 days of your baby's life. The milk your baby swallows heads to his stomach, where acids break it down and it moves into the small intestine. Some of the digested nutrients and water get absorbed into the bloodstream, and the larger, undigested ones (like fiber) keep moving through. If they continue through the intestines at a leisurely pace, your little one's body has enough time to absorb more water from them, so what comes out may be quite firm. But if things are moving rapidly, more water will come out with the rest of the waste, which could mean diarrhea. As poop moves thorough the intestines, it also picks up digestive juices, bile, bacteria, and other things, which give it different colors and smells. What a baby eats makes a difference in what winds up in his diaper. The body tends to absorb breast milk more completely -- sometimes there's so little left that a baby may not poop for days. On the other hand, many breastfed babies pass a mustardy, 'seedy' yellow stool with each feeding, at least for a short while. Formula-fed babies tend to have darker, tan-colored stools that happen less often. But remember: Every baby is different, and there is a very wide range of normal when it comes to poop. The color and timing of a baby's poop changes as his diet changes, as his digestive tract matures, and as it gets more new, normal bacteria. It's rare that color changes are signs of a digestive problem. Usually, they just mean that there is more or less of the yellow/green/brown/orange pigments that stool picks up along the way. Let your baby's doctor know if you see: Poop that stays chalky white. It may mean his liver isn't making enough bile to digest the food. Poop that is tarry black.

When should I seek help for stress?,MASH,"""When stress interrupts your life, causing sleep problems or making you feel anxious and out of control, talk with your primary health care professional. He or she might recommend a professional therapist who can offer support and give you some practical lifestyle tips in how to manage stress without letting it take over your life.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Stress. We all live with it each day. But how do you react to daily stress? For some people, life's stressors cause them to become irritable, short-tempered, or unable to concentrate on tasks. Others have interrupted sleep (trouble falling asleep or waking early in the morning with racing thoughts). Then there are those who react by eating junk food -- and a lot of it! ( Remember - desserts is stressed spelled backward!) The good news: No matter how busy your schedule, it is possible to manage stress and keep it from ruining your life. Simply stated, stress describes the many demands and pressures that we all experience, to some degree, each day. These demands are physical, mental, emotional, or even chemical in nature. The word 'stress' encompasses both the stressful situation, known as the stressor, and the symptoms you experience under stress, your stress response. The problem with stress is that it activates your sympathetic nervous system, stimulating the release of stress hormones throughout your body. These hormones give you super energy and cause other changes in the body such as the 'fight or flight' response. The 'fight or flight' response makes your heart beat faster. You might feel very nervous, making it difficult to breathe. Short term, the 'fight or flight' response causes changes that allow you to handle sudden stressful events. When you face fear -- or even recall a stressful or frightening event from the past -- the resulting hormonal changes super-charge your body to a state of high arousal. This prepares you for action. But long-term stress can be particularly difficult. When stress hormones stay elevated over time, there is a gradual and steady stream of harmful changes to the body. Long-term stress can suppress the immune system, which may lead to the development of diseases. Stress can be positive or negative, depending on the situation. Positive stressors (called eustress) may include an upcoming wedding, the holidays, or pregnancy. On the other hand, negative stress (called distress) results in the full-blown stress response. If continuous, negative stress can lead to loss of productivity, health problems, and exhaustion. Stress symptoms vary greatly from one person to the next, but the most universal sign of stress is a feeling of being pressured or overwhelmed. Other symptoms include: Physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches, chest pains, nausea, and diarrhea, and a sensation of numbness or tingling in your hands, arms, and face.) Problems getting along with family members, friends, and teachers. Changes in behavior at home (short temper, unexplained anger, crying for no reason). Regression -- behavior that is not age-appropriate. Dysfunctional sleep patterns, including nightmares, too little sleep, difficulty falling asleep, or even oversleeping. Communication difficulty or personality changes, such as becoming withdrawn or requiring much more attention than usual. Impatience. If you are experiencing a few of these symptoms, chances are that your level of stress is high. If left untreated, stress can lead to permanent feelings of helplessness and ineffectiveness. Now that you understand more about stress and the symptoms, try the following these 6 tips to unwind, de-stress, and get back in control of your emotional state: Identify the sources of stress. Try to figure out what's causing your stress symptoms. Maybe you are overextended (too many commitments) and feel fatigued and irritable. Once you identify the sources of stress, try to minimize these as much as possible. Talk it out. Talk to a friend, family member, or therapist if your stress level is too high. Getting your feelings out without others judging you is crucial to good mental health. Take time out. Before you reach your breaking point, take time out for solitude. Take time to nurture yourself, away from the cares and responsibilities of the world. Find time for inner strength and emotional healing. Set limits. Never hesitate to say 'no' before you take on too many commitments. Especially if you are balancing work and family, it's important to prioritize. Saying 'no' can help bring your stress to a manageable level and give you more control over your life. Try exhaling. Breathing can measure and alter your psychological state, making a stressful moment increase or diminish in intensity. Often, people who are anxious or upset take shallow breaths and unconsciously hold them. By paying attention to your breathing, particularly exhaling during tense moments, you will feel more relaxed. Buy a bottle of inexpensive bubbles (in the toy section at most stores), and use it to learn how to exhale slowly. Breathing from your abdomen, blow through the bubble blower with a steady stream of breath. If you blow too hard or too softly, you won't get any bubbles. But smooth, steady breaths will produce a nice flow of bubbles. Use this breathing technique (without the bubbles) when you are feeling stressed. Exercise daily. Exercise is thought to increase the secretion of endorphins, naturally produced substances in the brain that induce feelings of peacefulness. Many studies show that exercise, along with the boosted endorphin levels, really does increase confidence and self-esteem and reduce tension. Exercise also acts as a displacement defense mechanism for those who are 'stressed out.' What does that mean? If you've ever walked for several miles, you know how hard it is to think of your problems when your mind is focused on walking. The problem with stress is that it's cumulative. In other words, if you don't have a healthy way of responding to stress or counterbalancing the 'fight or flight' response, constant exposure to stress hormones overloads the body. Changes in levels of hormones produced by daily stress can hurt your health. When stress levels increase, it results in an overproduction of stress hormones that weaken the immune system.

When should I seek help for stress?,MASH,"""When stress interrupts your life, causing sleep problems or making you feel anxious and out of control, talk with your primary health care professional.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Stress. We all live with it each day. But how do you react to daily stress? For some people, life's stressors cause them to become irritable, short-tempered, or unable to concentrate on tasks. Others have interrupted sleep (trouble falling asleep or waking early in the morning with racing thoughts). Then there are those who react by eating junk food -- and a lot of it! ( Remember - desserts is stressed spelled backward!) The good news: No matter how busy your schedule, it is possible to manage stress and keep it from ruining your life. Simply stated, stress describes the many demands and pressures that we all experience, to some degree, each day. These demands are physical, mental, emotional, or even chemical in nature. The word 'stress' encompasses both the stressful situation, known as the stressor, and the symptoms you experience under stress, your stress response. The problem with stress is that it activates your sympathetic nervous system, stimulating the release of stress hormones throughout your body. These hormones give you super energy and cause other changes in the body such as the 'fight or flight' response. The 'fight or flight' response makes your heart beat faster. You might feel very nervous, making it difficult to breathe. Short term, the 'fight or flight' response causes changes that allow you to handle sudden stressful events. When you face fear -- or even recall a stressful or frightening event from the past -- the resulting hormonal changes super-charge your body to a state of high arousal. This prepares you for action. But long-term stress can be particularly difficult. When stress hormones stay elevated over time, there is a gradual and steady stream of harmful changes to the body. Long-term stress can suppress the immune system, which may lead to the development of diseases. Stress can be positive or negative, depending on the situation. Positive stressors (called eustress) may include an upcoming wedding, the holidays, or pregnancy. On the other hand, negative stress (called distress) results in the full-blown stress response. If continuous, negative stress can lead to loss of productivity, health problems, and exhaustion. Stress symptoms vary greatly from one person to the next, but the most universal sign of stress is a feeling of being pressured or overwhelmed. Other symptoms include: Physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches, chest pains, nausea, and diarrhea, and a sensation of numbness or tingling in your hands, arms, and face.) Problems getting along with family members, friends, and teachers. Changes in behavior at home (short temper, unexplained anger, crying for no reason). Regression -- behavior that is not age-appropriate. Dysfunctional sleep patterns, including nightmares, too little sleep, difficulty falling asleep, or even oversleeping. Communication difficulty or personality changes, such as becoming withdrawn or requiring much more attention than usual. Impatience. If you are experiencing a few of these symptoms, chances are that your level of stress is high. If left untreated, stress can lead to permanent feelings of helplessness and ineffectiveness. Now that you understand more about stress and the symptoms, try the following these 6 tips to unwind, de-stress, and get back in control of your emotional state: Identify the sources of stress. Try to figure out what's causing your stress symptoms. Maybe you are overextended (too many commitments) and feel fatigued and irritable. Once you identify the sources of stress, try to minimize these as much as possible. Talk it out. Talk to a friend, family member, or therapist if your stress level is too high. Getting your feelings out without others judging you is crucial to good mental health. Take time out. Before you reach your breaking point, take time out for solitude. Take time to nurture yourself, away from the cares and responsibilities of the world. Find time for inner strength and emotional healing. Set limits. Never hesitate to say 'no' before you take on too many commitments. Especially if you are balancing work and family, it's important to prioritize. Saying 'no' can help bring your stress to a manageable level and give you more control over your life. Try exhaling. Breathing can measure and alter your psychological state, making a stressful moment increase or diminish in intensity. Often, people who are anxious or upset take shallow breaths and unconsciously hold them. By paying attention to your breathing, particularly exhaling during tense moments, you will feel more relaxed. Buy a bottle of inexpensive bubbles (in the toy section at most stores), and use it to learn how to exhale slowly. Breathing from your abdomen, blow through the bubble blower with a steady stream of breath. If you blow too hard or too softly, you won't get any bubbles. But smooth, steady breaths will produce a nice flow of bubbles. Use this breathing technique (without the bubbles) when you are feeling stressed. Exercise daily. Exercise is thought to increase the secretion of endorphins, naturally produced substances in the brain that induce feelings of peacefulness. Many studies show that exercise, along with the boosted endorphin levels, really does increase confidence and self-esteem and reduce tension. Exercise also acts as a displacement defense mechanism for those who are 'stressed out.' What does that mean? If you've ever walked for several miles, you know how hard it is to think of your problems when your mind is focused on walking. The problem with stress is that it's cumulative. In other words, if you don't have a healthy way of responding to stress or counterbalancing the 'fight or flight' response, constant exposure to stress hormones overloads the body. Changes in levels of hormones produced by daily stress can hurt your health. When stress levels increase, it results in an overproduction of stress hormones that weaken the immune system. This can lead to physical and psychological problems. Chronic, or long-term, stress often results in high anxiety, insomnia, depression, gastrointestinal problems, and can even lead to dependency on drugs and alcohol (a self-medication solution that makes an already bad problem worse).

Can you prevent essential tremor nerve disorder?,MASH,"""Because we do not know the exact cause of Essential Tremor, there is currently no way to prevent it. However, knowing that ET has a genetic link brings us further in the search for effective treatments and, ultimately, ways to prevent it"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Essential Tremor is a nerve disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking, or 'tremors,' in different parts and on different sides of the body. Areas affected often include the hands, arms, head, larynx (voice box), tongue, and chin. The lower body is rarely affected. ET is not a life-threatening disorder, unless it prevents a person from caring for him or herself. Most people are able to live normal lives with this condition -- although they may find everyday activities like eating, dressing, or writing difficult. It is only when the tremors become severe that they actually cause disability. The true cause of Essential Tremor is still not understood, but it is thought that the abnormal electrical brain activity that causes tremor is processed through the thalamus. The thalamus is a structure deep in the brain that coordinates and controls muscle activity. Genetics is responsible for causing ET in half of all people with the condition. A child born to a parent with ET will have up to a 50% chance of inheriting the responsible gene, but may never actually experience symptoms. Although ET is more common in the elderly -- and symptoms become more pronounced with age -- it is not a part of the natural aging process. Essential Tremor is the most common movement disorder, affecting up to 10 million people in the U. S. While ET can occur at any age, it most often strikes for the first time during adolescence or in middle age (between ages 40 and 50). The primary symptoms associated with essential tremor include: Uncontrollable shaking that occurs for brief periods of time Shaking voice Nodding head Tremors that worsen during periods of emotional stress Tremors that get worse with purposeful movement Tremors that lessen with rest Balance problems (in rare cases) The uncontrollable shaking associated with ET is not unique to this condition. Many different factors or diseases can also cause tremors, including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, fatigue after exercise, extreme emotional distress, brain tumors, some prescription drugs, metabolic abnormalities, and alcohol or drug withdrawal. Essential Tremor is linked to other illnesses. Other movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, have been associated with ET. Some reports have also linked ET with migraine headaches. People with ET may also be at a high risks of developing dementia (particularly Alzheimer's disease) . Drugs used to treat Essential Tremor may also increase a person's risk of becoming depressed. Some experts also feel that there is no increased risk for Parkinson's disease for people with ET. Instead, some people diagnosed as having ET are initially incorrectly diagnosed and subsequently turn out to have Parkinson's disease. A neurologist or movement disorder specialist can usually diagnose Essential Tremor based on reported symptoms and a complete neurological exam. There is no specific blood, urine, or other test used to diagnose ET. As part of the exam, your health care provider may consider other causes of tremor, such as thyroid disease, excessive caffeine intake, or medication side effects. Mild essential tremor may not require treatment. However, if ET interferes with your ability to function or if you find it socially unacceptable, there are treatments that may improve symptoms. Treatments may include medications or surgery. Medications: Oral drugs can significantly reduce the severity of essential tremor. Medications include propranolol ( Inderal), primidone ( Mysoline), gabapentin ( Neurontin), and topiramate ( Topamax). Other drug options include the benzodiazepines lorazepam ( Ativan), clonazepam ( Klonopin), diazepam ( Valium), and alprazolam ( Xanax). Botox injections may also be a treatment option. This treatment has been effective for vocal and head tremors. Surgery: Deep brain stimulation ( DBS) is a surgical treatment option for people with severe tremor despite medical therapy. DBS involves surgical implantation of electrical leads into the thalamus. This is an area deep within the brain that coordinates muscle control that is thought to be affected in ET. MRI-guided Focused High Intensity Ultrasound: Neuravive uses magnetic resonance images ( MRI) to focus ultrasound to destroy tissue in the thalamus. Patients are awake and responsive during the entire treatment. Because we do not know the exact cause of Essential Tremor, there is currently no way to prevent it. However, knowing that ET has a genetic link brings us further in the search for effective treatments and, ultimately, ways to prevent it. There is no cure for essential tremor, but treatments that provide relief from its symptoms may be helpful in improving quality of life. These include drugs and surgery that ease tremor. But not every treatment or procedure is effective for every person with ET.

Spider veins are easily visible through the skin, as well. They are typically visible on the legs and face. A number of factors predispose a person to varicose veins and spider veins. These include: Heredity Occupations that involve a lot of standing, such as nurses, hair stylists, teachers, and factory workers Obesity Hormonal influences of pregnancy, puberty, and menopause The use of birth control pills Postmenopausal hormonal replacement A history of blood clots Conditions that cause increased pressure in the abdomen, such as tumors, constipation, and externally worn garments like girdles. Other reported causes include trauma or injury to the skin, previous vein surgery, and exposure to ultraviolet rays. Varicose veins and spider veins develop more often in women than in men. They increase in frequency with age. An estimated 30% to 60% of adults have varicose veins or spider veins. Many people with varicose veins complain of pain, described as an aching or cramping in the legs. Other common symptoms include tiredness, restlessness, burning, throbbing, tingling, or heaviness in the legs. Pain from these veins is usually relieved by elevating the legs or by wearing support hose. In women, symptoms may be worse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy. Less common is swelling, ulcers and a darkening of the skin, especially in the ankle region. Occasionally, varicose veins can form a painful blood clot with inflammation of the vein, a condition called thrombophlebitis. There are seven major forms of treatment for varicose veins and spider veins: 1. Support stockings. The most conservative approach is simply to wear properly-fitting support hose, especially when the veins cause painful or uncomfortable symptoms. These stockings can generally be purchased at any surgical supply store and at some pharmacies. They come in below-the-knee, above-the-knee, and pantyhose styles. 2. Lifestyle changes. Good skin hygiene, weight loss (if needed), and walking can help treat varicose veins and spider veins. 3. Sclerotherapy. This procedure, which has been available since the 1930s, is another treatment option. This procedure uses a highly concentrated saline (salt) solution or a specially made detergent that is injected directly into the vein, causing the vein to disappear gradually over three to six weeks. The procedure is simple, relatively inexpensive, and can be performed in an outpatient setting. 4. Endovenous laser treatment is a procedure in which a small laser fiber is inserted into the vein. Pulses of laser light are delivered inside the vein, which causes the vein to collapse. The procedure is done as an outpatient under local anesthesia. 5. Radiofrequency occlusion. A small catheter is inserted into the vein. The catheter delivers radiofrequency energy to the vein wall, causing it to heat, collapse, and seal shut. The procedure is generally done in an outpatient or office setting, sometimes under local anesthesia. 6. Surgery. Surgical techniques to treat varicose veins include ligation (tying off of a vein) and stripping (removal of a long segment of vein). Another procedure, ambulatory phlebectomy, allows for the removal of large surface veins through very small incisions that do not need stitches. Surgery may be performed using local, spinal, or general anesthesia. Most patients return home the same day as the procedure. Surgery is generally used to treat large varicose veins. 7. Lasers and intense pulsed light. Surface laser or intense pulsed light treatments, such as Vasculight and Photo Derm, are other options. These devices use heat energy to selectively damage or destroy abnormal veins. An advantage of these treatments is that no needles or sclerosing solutions are required; however, there may be some minor discomfort. Side effects do occur, including discoloration or staining and blister formation. The results are often disappointing. Not everybody with varicose or spider veins has pain or other symptoms. They might want the veins removed, however, for cosmetic reasons. Many insurance companies cover the cost of treating varicose veins, but generally not spider veins. The best approach is to check with your insurance company before considering treatment options.</p>",2025-11-25 02:50:36-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Spider veins are easily visible through the skin, as well. They are typically visible on the legs and face. A number of factors predispose a person to varicose veins and spider veins. These include: Heredity Occupations that involve a lot of standing, such as nurses, hair stylists, teachers, and factory workers Obesity Hormonal influences of pregnancy, puberty, and menopause The use of birth control pills Postmenopausal hormonal replacement A history of blood clots Conditions that cause increased pressure in the abdomen, such as tumors, constipation, and externally worn garments like girdles. Other reported causes include trauma or injury to the skin, previous vein surgery, and exposure to ultraviolet rays. Varicose veins and spider veins develop more often in women than in men. They increase in frequency with age. An estimated 30% to 60% of adults have varicose veins or spider veins. Many people with varicose veins complain of pain, described as an aching or cramping in the legs. Other common symptoms include tiredness, restlessness, burning, throbbing, tingling, or heaviness in the legs. Pain from these veins is usually relieved by elevating the legs or by wearing support hose. In women, symptoms may be worse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy. Less common is swelling, ulcers and a darkening of the skin, especially in the ankle region. Occasionally, varicose veins can form a painful blood clot with inflammation of the vein, a condition called thrombophlebitis. There are seven major forms of treatment for varicose veins and spider veins: 1. Support stockings. The most conservative approach is simply to wear properly-fitting support hose, especially when the veins cause painful or uncomfortable symptoms. These stockings can generally be purchased at any surgical supply store and at some pharmacies. They come in below-the-knee, above-the-knee, and pantyhose styles. 2. Lifestyle changes. Good skin hygiene, weight loss (if needed), and walking can help treat varicose veins and spider veins. 3. Sclerotherapy. This procedure, which has been available since the 1930s, is another treatment option. This procedure uses a highly concentrated saline (salt) solution or a specially made detergent that is injected directly into the vein, causing the vein to disappear gradually over three to six weeks. The procedure is simple, relatively inexpensive, and can be performed in an outpatient setting. 4. Endovenous laser treatment is a procedure in which a small laser fiber is inserted into the vein. Pulses of laser light are delivered inside the vein, which causes the vein to collapse. The procedure is done as an outpatient under local anesthesia. 5. Radiofrequency occlusion. A small catheter is inserted into the vein. The catheter delivers radiofrequency energy to the vein wall, causing it to heat, collapse, and seal shut. The procedure is generally done in an outpatient or office setting, sometimes under local anesthesia. 6. Surgery. Surgical techniques to treat varicose veins include ligation (tying off of a vein) and stripping (removal of a long segment of vein). Another procedure, ambulatory phlebectomy, allows for the removal of large surface veins through very small incisions that do not need stitches. Surgery may be performed using local, spinal, or general anesthesia. Most patients return home the same day as the procedure. Surgery is generally used to treat large varicose veins. 7. Lasers and intense pulsed light. Surface laser or intense pulsed light treatments, such as Vasculight and Photo Derm, are other options. These devices use heat energy to selectively damage or destroy abnormal veins. An advantage of these treatments is that no needles or sclerosing solutions are required; however, there may be some minor discomfort. Side effects do occur, including discoloration or staining and blister formation. The results are often disappointing. Not everybody with varicose or spider veins has pain or other symptoms. They might want the veins removed, however, for cosmetic reasons. Many insurance companies cover the cost of treating varicose veins, but generally not spider veins. The best approach is to check with your insurance company before considering treatment options.</p>",2025-11-25 04:20:44-08:00,False,Response is valid.

How often will you have flare-ups of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)?,MASH,"""You may have a flare-up every few weeks, or you may go months with clear skin.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS) is different for every person, so it can be hard to predict exactly what it will be like. But along with your treatment plan, there are some good ways to manage the condition. It helps to know how the disease can affect your life, so you can make changes that will help. There's no cure for HS, so you'll have to manage the condition for life. For most people, it's a cycle of flare-ups and periods when their skin is clear. Breakouts tend to happen in the same general areas of your skin. But you may have a spot that stays broken-out all the time. Some women find their HS clears up after menopause. HS is called a progressive disease. That means it often gets worse over time. A small pimple can turn into a large boil within days or hours. If the boil ruptures underneath the skin, inflammation and infection spread quickly and new lumps form nearby. A flare-up may last a week or two. But treatment can keep HS from getting worse and help you avoid the most serious symptoms. The key is to start it early. Your symptoms and the way your body responds to treatment will determine how often you see your doctor. You may be able to manage mild symptoms on your own. If you take a drug that's injected or delivered through a vein, you may need to go in regularly. People with HS tend to have other conditions, too, such as severe acne, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Doctors don't know exactly why these conditions are linked. But it may be that whatever causes HS leads to other problems, too. It's rare, but people who have HS for a long time may be more likely to get a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. It's important to see your doctor regularly, keep her updated on how you feel, and talk about any new or unusual symptoms you've noticed. It depends on how severe your condition is. Large, deep nodules or lumps can hurt. And depending on where they are, you may not be able to sit or walk normally. Some people only get these painful lumps from time to time when the disease flares. But for others, the bumps or lumps never completely go away. Whether you have pain only during flares or more often, your doctor can help you control it. You may get numbing creams or over-the-counter or prescription pain medicine. The lumps themselves don't smell, but the fluid inside them does. When they burst and leak, the odor can escape, too. Wear loose clothing and try to keep things from rubbing against the cysts. Don't squeeze them. If they do burst, wash the area gently with an antiseptic cleanser to get rid of the smell. Antibiotics may also help. HS can be unpredictable. You may have a flare-up every few weeks, or you may go months with clear skin. Some women find they have breakouts before their periods. They may go away while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. There's no sure way to prevent breakouts. But they may not come back as often or be as bad if you follow your treatment plan, take any medication your doctor prescribes, and make some changes to your lifestyle. Get to a healthy weight. HS is closely tied to obesity. Losing weight is one of the best ways to keep it under control. Quit smoking. Stay cool. Your HS may get worse in the summer, when heat and sweat can trigger a flare-up. Swimming is a good way to get exercise without overheating. Don't shave near a breakout. If your razor irritates your skin, laser hair removal may be a better choice. Watch what you eat. There's some evidence that it may help to cut dairy and sugar from your diet.

What should you know about the stomach flu?,MASH,"""Every year, millions of Americans come down with the 'stomach flu,' or viral gastroenteritis. It can cause diarrhea, vomiting, cramps, fever, and headache. It's also highly contagious.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Every year, millions of Americans come down with the 'stomach flu,' or viral gastroenteritis. It can cause diarrhea, vomiting, cramps, fever, and headache. It's also highly contagious. What treatments will make life with the stomach flu a little less awful? More importantly, how can you avoid getting it in the first place? Here are some answers. The stomach flu is not a single disease. Instead, it's just a nickname for viral gastroenteritis, which is itself caused by a number of nasty viruses, such as noroviruses, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses. These viruses target the digestive tract and cause inflammation of the stomach and intestines. The most awful symptoms -- diarrhea, vomiting, and cramps -- are actually your body's defense mechanisms. Your body is trying to drive the virus out. Stomach flu can develop at any time of the year, but it's most common in the fall and winter in the U. S. Although unpleasant, stomach flu is rarely serious. Symptoms usually last for 1 to 3 days and sometimes longer. The greatest risk -- especially in babies and older people -- comes from dehydration. Untreated, dehydration can be dangerous. Despite the name, stomach flu has nothing to do with the 'true' flu, influenza. Influenza causes body ache and fever. It almost never causes diarrhea or vomiting in adults. Rarely, it can trigger vomiting in children. There is no cure for the stomach flu. Antibiotics don't help, because it's caused by viruses, not bacteria. For the most part, you just have to wait it out. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to make yourself more comfortable and prevent complications. Drink more. It's important to increase fluid intake when you are vomiting or have diarrhea. Adults should aim to get one cup of fluid every hour. Children need 1 ounce of fluid every 30 to 60 minutes. Drink slowly, since too much at once could worsen vomiting. If your child tends to gulp, give her a frozen popsicle instead. Drink wisely. When you have diarrhea, drinking more water may not be enough. You're losing important minerals and electrolytes that water can't supply. Instead, ask your doctor about giving your sick child an oral rehydration solution such as Cera Lyte, Infalyte, Naturalyte, Pedialyte, and generic brands. ( If your baby is still nursing or using formula, keep feeding him as usual.) Adults can use oral rehydration solutions or diluted juices, diluted sports drinks, clear broth, or decaffeinated tea. Sugary, carbonated, caffeinated, or alcoholic drinks can make diarrhea worse, so be sure to dilute sugary beverages if you drink them. Don't eat only bland foods. The old advice was to stick with a liquid diet for a few days and then to add in bland foods, such as the BRAT diet of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. That's fine for the first day or so of stomach flu. However, doctors say that you should return to your normal diet as soon as you feel up to it. BRAT foods aren't bad. They just don't provide the fat and protein that you need. Sticking with them too long could actually slow your recovery. Get the right nutrients. Look for foods with potassium (such as potatoes, bananas, and fruit juices), salt (such as pretzels and soup), and yogurt with active bacterial cultures. Even a little fat could help, because it slows down digestion and may reduce diarrhea. If you feel up to it, add a pat of butter or some lean meat to your next meal. Use over-the-counter medications. They're not necessary, but some people find relief in medications for diarrhea and vomiting. Just use them with care, and read and follow the label instructions. Never give a medication for diarrhea or vomiting to a child unless a pediatrician says that you should. Rest. Give your body time to recover. The viruses that cause gastroenteritis come from contact with an infected person's stool. You may get it if a person with the virus didn't wash his hands after using the bathroom and then touched the escalator at the mall -- the same escalator you touched before eating lunch. Stomach flu viruses are tough, too. Some can live on surfaces such as counters for months. It's important to take steps to protect yourself and your family. Here's some advice. Wash your hands. According to experts, this is still the best way to stop a stomach virus. One review of studies found that good hand-washing technique cut the rate of diarrhea by 40%. Make sure to use soap and water and do it thoroughly -- wash your hands for as long as it takes to recite the alphabet. Always wash your hands after using the bathroom, before eating, and after changing a diaper. Use hand sanitizer. If you're not near a sink to wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Be aware that hand sanitizer may not be as effective as hand washing at preventing the stomach flu. Wipe down surfaces. If a family member has the stomach flu, wash off high-traffic areas -- such as the bathroom, door knobs, phones, and TV remotes -- with a diluted bleach solution. If it's possible, keep healthy people out of the bathroom the sick person is using. Make sure your kids get their vaccines. Vaccines for rotavirus can protect children from some types of stomach flu. Kids usually get the vaccines before they are age 2. Most people don't need to see the doctor when they have the stomach flu. But it's a good idea to get medical attention if you or your child has stomach flu and: Is under 3 months old Is over 3 months old and has been vomiting for more than 12 hours or the diarrhea hasn't gotten better after two days Is an adult and the diarrhea hasn't gotten a little better after two days Has other symptoms, such as high fever or blood or pus in the stool In rare cases, people with stomach flu need to be hospitalized, usually because of dehydration. In adults, dehydration can cause extreme thirst, decreased urination, dark urine, dry skin, fatigue, and dizziness. In babies and young children, dehydration can cause: Crying without tears Going three hours or more without a wet diaper Fever Dry tongue and mouth Extreme crankiness Sunken fontanel, the soft spot on the top of a baby's head Sunken cheeks or eyes Anyone with signs of dehydration needs medical help right away.</p>",2025-11-25 04:39:09-08:00,False,Response is valid.

No. The part of the HPV virus used in both vaccines is inactivated (not live), so it can't cause actual HPV infection.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> When the FDA approved the first human papillomavirus ( HPV) vaccine in 2006, it was big news. The new HPV vaccination made headlines at the time, which wasn't surprising, given that it was the very first vaccine approved to prevent cervical cancer. Yet, even though the HPV vaccine has been around for years, not everyone knows exactly what it is or what it does. You might be wondering: How does it work? Is it safe? Should you or your child get it? So you can be more confident when you talk to your doctor about the HPV vaccine, here are answers to these and other common questions about the vaccine. HPV stands for human papillomavirus. It's a virus that can be transmitted through sexual contact. During intercourse or oral sex, HPV can make its way into the genitals, mouth, or throat and cause infection. Sexually transmitted HPV comes in more than 40 different varieties. The type of the virus you get determines what effects it has on your body. Certain types of HPV cause genital warts. Other HPV types can make cells turn cancerous. You've probably heard that HPV causes cervical cancer, but it also causes less common cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, head, and neck. What's tricky about HPV is that it doesn't have symptoms. There's no sore throat or fever to let you know you've been infected. Most people clear the infection on their own. In fact, you might have absolutely no idea you've been infected until you develop genital warts or have an abnormal Pap test. Though HPV might not be as well known among sexually transmitted infections ( STIs) as herpes or syphilis, it is actually the most common STI. If you're sexually active, there's a very good chance of being infected with HPV at some point in your life. That's why immunization is so important. Three vaccines are available to protect against the types of HPV that cause most cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile and anal cancers. They are Gardasil, and Gardasil 9. They also protect against most genital warts. Whichever of these vaccines you and your doctor choose, you should stick with the same vaccine for all three shots. Whether you have to get vaccinated depends on your age and where you live. In certain states, girls and boys within the recommended ages may need to get the HPV vaccine in order to go to school. Getting vaccinated could help lead to the reduction of the prevalence of HPV infection. HPV is known to cause cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal cancer, as well as cancer of the back of the throat. Cervical cancer alone kills about 4,000 women each year in the U. S. One in four persons in the United States is infected with HPV and most of them are unaware. It spreads easily among infected partners. Gardasil prevents HPV-16 and HPV-18, which is responsible for 70% of all cervical cancers, as well as HPV- 6 and HPV-11, which are known to cause 90% of all genital warts. Gardasil 9 also protects against these four HPV strains, as well as five others. The best time to get the HPV vaccine is before you've started having sexual activity. That's why the CDC recommends that both boys and girls get their vaccination at age 11 or 12, although they can get the vaccine as early as age 9. If you're 13 or older and you haven't already been vaccinated, you can still get the vaccine through age 26. Gardasil 9 can be given to both males and females until age 45. The Gardasil vaccine isn't recommended for people over age 26, because it hasn't been studied well enough in this age group. If enough future studies show that it is safe and effective for people over 26, the FDA may eventually start recommending it for this age group. The FDA has approved the use of Gardasil 9 for males and females up to age 45. You'll get three shots of the HPV vaccine over a 6-month period. You need to take all three doses to be completely protected. You'll get the second shot about 1 to 2 months after the first, and the third shot 6 months after the first. Once you've started with a vaccine brand ( Gardasil or Gardasil 9), stick with it for all three shots. No. If you have a current HPV, the vaccine won't get rid of the infection. However, if you have one type of HPV, the vaccine may prevent you from getting another type of the virus. There's really no way to treat the virus once you have it, although there are treatments for diseases caused by HPV such as genital warts and genital cancers. This is why you should have regular pelvic exams and Pap tests (if you're female) to screen for cervical cancer. The vaccine appears to offer long-term protection from HPV. However, even women who have received the vaccine should see their gynecologist regularly for a Pap test to check for cervical cancer, because the vaccine doesn't protect against all HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. Most insurance plans cover routine vaccines, which means that if you're in the recommended age group, your insurance should pay for the vaccine. Check with your insurance company just to be sure. If your family doesn't have health insurance or you're on Medicaid, you should be able to get the HPV vaccine for free through the Vaccines for Children ( VFC) program. Vaccines have to be rigorously tested before they can be widely distributed. The HPV vaccines were tested on thousands of people and shown to be safe before they were released to the public. These vaccines have been used for years now, and experts say the chance of them causing a serious reaction is very slim. The HPV vaccine does not contain mercury or the preservative thimerosal. Some people shouldn't get the vaccine. You definitely don't want to get the HPV vaccine if you've had a serious allergic reaction to it or to any of its components. Let your doctor know if you have any severe allergies to anything, including baker's yeast or latex. Also, talk to your doctor if you have an immune system problem or blood disorder. If you're pregnant, you'll want to wait to get the HPV vaccine until after your baby is born. In studies, HPV vaccines have not been found to cause any problems in babies whose mothers got the vaccine while pregnant, but pregnant women should not get HPV vaccine, as safety studies are still ongoing. You could have side effects, but they should be mild. Most people who complain of symptoms after getting the HPV shot have minor issues like pain or swelling at the site of the shot, fever, headache, and nausea. Sometimes people faint after getting the HPV vaccine or any other vaccination. Sitting down after getting the shot can help prevent you from passing out.

However, if you have one type of HPV, the vaccine may prevent you from getting another type of the virus. There's really no way to treat the virus once you have it, although there are treatments for diseases caused by HPV such as genital warts and genital cancers. This is why you should have regular pelvic exams and Pap tests (if you're female) to screen for cervical cancer. The vaccine appears to offer long-term protection from HPV. However, even women who have received the vaccine should see their gynecologist regularly for a Pap test to check for cervical cancer, because the vaccine doesn't protect against all HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. Most insurance plans cover routine vaccines, which means that if you're in the recommended age group, your insurance should pay for the vaccine. Check with your insurance company just to be sure. If your family doesn't have health insurance or you're on Medicaid, you should be able to get the HPV vaccine for free through the Vaccines for Children ( VFC) program. Vaccines have to be rigorously tested before they can be widely distributed. The HPV vaccines were tested on thousands of people and shown to be safe before they were released to the public. These vaccines have been used for years now, and experts say the chance of them causing a serious reaction is very slim. The HPV vaccine does not contain mercury or the preservative thimerosal. Some people shouldn't get the vaccine. You definitely don't want to get the HPV vaccine if you've had a serious allergic reaction to it or to any of its components. Let your doctor know if you have any severe allergies to anything, including baker's yeast or latex. Also, talk to your doctor if you have an immune system problem or blood disorder. If you're pregnant, you'll want to wait to get the HPV vaccine until after your baby is born. In studies, HPV vaccines have not been found to cause any problems in babies whose mothers got the vaccine while pregnant, but pregnant women should not get HPV vaccine, as safety studies are still ongoing. You could have side effects, but they should be mild. Most people who complain of symptoms after getting the HPV shot have minor issues like pain or swelling at the site of the shot, fever, headache, and nausea. Sometimes people faint after getting the HPV vaccine or any other vaccination. Sitting down after getting the shot can help prevent you from passing out. No. The part of the HPV virus used in both vaccines is inactivated (not live), so it can't cause actual HPV infection.</p>",2025-11-25 08:46:19-08:00,False,Response is valid.

That's because these are common, severe illnesses and leading causes of disability. Depression and bipolar disorder can be emotionally crippling, making it difficult to live life to its fullest. Persistent Depressive Disorder, a newer diagnosis that consolidates chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder, is a condition where a person is depressed for at least 2 years. Persistent Depressive Disorder is a less severe form of depression. Although less extreme, Persistent Depressive Disorder ( PDD) causes chronic or long-lasting moodiness that ranges in severity. It is marked by a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years. In children and teens, moods can be irritable for at least 1 year to be called Persistent Depressive Disorder. PDD can occur alone or with other psychiatric or mood disorders, although not with mania or hypomania. As with depression, PDD is more common in women than in men. A family history of mood disorders is not uncommon. This mood disorder tends to appear earlier than major depression, although it can begin anytime from childhood to later in life. Up to 4% of the general population is affected by PDD. Its cause is not well understood. A combination of factors likely conspires to create this mood disorder. These factors may include: Genetics Abnormalities in the functioning of brain circuits involve in emotional processing Chronic stress or medical illness Isolation Poor coping strategies and problems adjusting to life stresses These factors can feed off each other. For example, if you always see 'the glass as half empty,' you may reinforce the symptoms of depression. And a chronic mood disorder can sensitize you to stress, further feeding your risk for depression. In addition to chronic low moods, common symptoms of this mood disorder include: Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness Trouble sleeping or daytime sleepiness Poor appetite or eating too much Poor concentration Fatigue or low energy Low self-esteem Trouble concentrating or making decisions A diagnosis of PDD in adults requires at least a two-year history of depressed mood for most of the day on most days, along with at least two of the symptoms noted above. Although some symptoms may overlap, you may be less likely to have weight or sleep changes with PDD than with depression. You may also tend to withdraw more and have stronger feelings of pessimism and inadequacy than with major depression. Staying in a constant state of moodiness is no way to live. That's one reason to seek treatment. Another is that PDD can also increase your risk for physical diseases. Yet another reason to pursue treatment? If left untreated, this mood disorder can develop into more severe depression. It can also increase your risk for attempting suicide. Antidepressants , such as selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants, are often used to treat PDD. Because you may need to continue treatment for a lengthy period, it's important to consider which medications not only work well but also ideally have few side effects. You may need to try more than one medication to find the one that works best. But know that it may take several weeks or longer to take effect. Successful treatment for chronic depression often takes longer than for acute (non-chronic) depression. Take your medications as your doctor instructs. If they're causing side effects or still not working after several weeks, discuss this with your doctor. Don't suddenly stop taking your medications. Doctors believe treatment for PDD is effective with a combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy. Specific kinds of talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or interpersonal therapy ( IPT), are known to be effective forms of psychotherapy that treat PDD. A structured treatment lasting for a certain period of time, CBT involves recognizing and restructuring thoughts. It can help you change your distorted thinking. IPT is also a time-limited, structured treatment. Its focus is on addressing current problems and solving interpersonal conflicts. Psychodynamic psychotherapy involves exploring unhealthy or unsatisfying patterns of behavior and motivations that you may not be consciously aware of which could lead to feelings of depression and negative expectations and life experiences. Some studies also suggest that aerobic exercise can help with mood disorders. This is most effective when done four to six times a week. But some exercise is better than none at all. Other changes may also help, including seeking social support and finding an interesting occupation. Used for patients with major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern (formerly known as seasonal affective disorder), bright-light therapy may also help some people with PDD. Bipolar disorder causes severe, unusual shifts in mood and energy that affect your ability to do normal tasks at home, school, or work. Cyclothymic disorder is often thought of as a mild form of bipolar disorder. With cyclothymic disorder, you have low-grade high periods (hypomanias) as well as brief, fleeting periods of depression that don't last as long (less than 2 weeks at a time) as in a major depressive episode. The hypomanias in cyclothymic disorder are similar to those seen in bipolar II disorder, and do not progress to full-blown manias. For example, you may feel an exaggerated sense of productivity or power, but you don't lose connection with reality. In fact, some people feel the 'highs' of cyclothymic disorder are even enjoyable. They tend to not be as disabling as they are with bipolar disorder. Up to 1% of the U. S. population -- equal numbers of men and women -- has cyclothymia. Its cause is unknown, but genetics may play a role; cyclothymia is more common in people with relatives who have bipolar disorder. Symptoms usually appear in adolescence or young adulthood. But because symptoms are mild, it is often difficult to tell when cyclothymia begins. A diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder may result from simply describing symptoms like these: Episodes that involve brief, recurrent periods of depression and, at other times, episodes of hypomania; this pattern of episodes must be present for at least 2 years. Symptoms that persist, creating fewer than 2 symptom-free months in a row. The episodes of cyclothymic disorder are often somewhat unpredictable. Either depression or hypomania can last for days or weeks, interspersed with a month or two of normal moods. Or, you may have no 'normal' periods in between. In some cases, cyclothymic disorder progresses to full-blown bipolar disease. Some people with mild symptoms of cyclothymia are able to live successful, fulfilling lives. Others find their relationships troubled by depression, impulsive actions, and strong emotions. For these people, short-term medications may bring relief. However, cyclothymic disorder may not respond as well to medications as does bipolar disorder. A combination of mood stabilizers and psychotherapy is most effective. Mood stabilizers include antiseizure drugs such as lithium, Depakote, Tegretol, or Lamictal.</p>",2025-11-25 01:39:07-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Your doctor may suggest metoprolol ( Lopressor, Toprol XL) or propranolol ( Inderal, Innopran XL). Botulinum toxin ( Botox). A doctor can inject small amounts around your face and scalp every 3 months to stop migraines from happening. Calcium-channel blockers. These include diltiazem ( Cardizem, Cartia, Covera HS, Tiazac) and verapamil ( Calan, Verelan). They ease the narrowing of your blood vessels. Antidepressants . Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline ( Aventyl) or nortriptyline ( Pamelor). Research suggests duloxetine ( Cymbalta) and venlafaxine ( Effexor XR) may be helpful in preventing migraines. CGRP Inhibitors. CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a molecule involved in causing migraine pain. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of drugs that block the effects of CGRP. Erenumab ( Aimovig) and fremanezumab ( Ajovy) are specifically approved to prevent migraine attacks. You give yourself an injection once a month with a pen-like device. You may want to consider medicine to prevent migraines if you: Have pain that hampers your life despite treatment Get at more than three moderate to severe headaches per month Take a lot of painkillers Don't get enough relief from meds you now take Have side effects from your headache drugs Have uncommon migraine conditions like continuing aura (blurred vision or seeing spots or wavy lines) Preventive medicine might not be right for you if: Your headaches are infrequent and controlled by anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and naproxen. Other health conditions keep you from taking preventive drugs. Those drugs could mix badly with other medicines you take. You prefer treatments that don't involve meds. If you can't take medication or prefer not to, there's also a device you and your doctor could consider. It's called Cefaly, and it's the first FDA-approved machine that prevents migraine in people over 18. It's a portable headband-like device that you wear around your forehead. It gives out electrical impulses that stimulate a nerve connected with migraines. You'll feel a tingling sensation and should use it once a day for 20 minutes. Your headaches may ease up during your second and third trimesters. If you have severe migraines, your doctor may suggest that you first try a treatment that's not a drug -- such as biofeedback, relaxation therapy, or stress management training.

Your headaches may ease up during your second and third trimesters. If you have severe migraines, your doctor may suggest that you first try a treatment that's not a drug -- such as biofeedback, relaxation therapy, or stress management training. He may also recommend a preventive drug that has the lowest risk possible. Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of taking preventive medications for migraine. Together, you can decide the best approach for you.</p>",2025-11-25 05:16:00-08:00,False,Response is valid.
How can I ease my food allergy symptoms?,MASH,"""If you have a food allergy, you'll need to stop eating the food altogether.

Why does it matter? Although they may have similar symptoms, a food allergy can be more serious. These clues can help you figure out if it is an allergy or intolerance. A doctor can help you know for sure. Food Allergy: Usually comes on suddenly Small amount of food can trigger Happens every time you eat the food Can be life-threatening Food Intolerance: Usually comes on gradually May only happen when you eat a lot of the food May only happen if you eat the food often Is not life-threatening A food allergy and an intolerance both can cause: Nausea Stomach pain Diarrhea Vomiting When a food irritates your stomach or your body can't properly digest it, that's an intolerance. You may have these symptoms: Gas, cramps, or bloating Heartburn Headaches Irritability or nervousness A food allergy happens when your immune system mistakes something in food as harmful and attacks it. It can affect your whole body, not just your stomach. Symptoms may include: Rash, hives, or itchy skin Shortness of breath Chest pain Sudden drop in blood pressure, trouble swallowing or breathing -- this is life-threatening. Call 911 immediately. These triggers cause about 90% of food allergies: Peanuts Tree nuts (such as walnuts, pecans and almonds) Fish Shellfish Milk Eggs Soy Wheat The most common food intolerance is lactose intolerance. It happens when people can't digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy. Another kind of intolerance is being sensitive to sulfites or other food additives. Sulfites can trigger asthma attacks in some people. What about a gluten allergy? While celiac disease -- a long-lasting digestive condition that's triggered by eating gluten -- does involve the immune system, it doesn't cause life-threatening symptoms. Your doctor can find out if you have an allergy or intolerance. These things may help: Keep a diary of the foods you eat and the symptoms you have. Stop eating some foods to help figure out which one is causing symptoms. Have allergy tests done. If you have a food allergy, you'll need to stop eating the food altogether. If you have a food intolerance, you'll need to avoid or cut back on that food in your diet. For lactose intolerance, you can look for lactose-free milk or take a lactase enzyme supplement.

When should I call the doctor about my newborn's vomiting?,MASH,"""It's normal for your newborn to spit up small amounts of milk within an hour after being fed. But if the flow is particularly forceful and happens more than two or three times in a day, call your doctor.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Wouldn't it be great if your newborn came home from the hospital with a set of instructions and rules that spelled out exactly when you need to call the pediatrician? But she doesn't. And your little one can't tell you what's wrong. So it's important to know the signs of serious problems. Trouble breathing. If your baby is breathing more than 60 breaths a minute, having pauses in breathing, or has a bluish tint to her skin, lips, and nails, it could be a lung or heart condition. Fever. If the baby's temperature measured in the rectum is 100.4 F or higher, she has a fever. For the first 3 months of your baby's life, take temperatures in the rectum, not in the ear, mouth, or under the armpit. Fever in newborns may be due to a serious condition such as bacterial meningitis or sepsis, a bloodstream infection. Both can be life-threatening if they aren't treated right away. Before you call, write down your child's temperature and the exact time you took it. Blood in vomit or stool. It may just be due to diaper rash, but it could also be a sign of a more serious stomach condition. Yellowish skin or eyes. This can be a sign of jaundice, which usually develops between the second and fourth day after birth. You can check by pressing gently on your infant's forehead -- if the skin looks yellow, she may have mild jaundice. Most hospitals check your newborn for jaundice before she goes home, but it can develop in breastfed babies anytime during the first week of life. Your pediatrician will check for it during the first office visit, 1-3 days after the baby leaves the hospital. Your baby is sleeping more than usual or won't wake up. It's true that most newborns can sleep pretty much through anything. But if your baby won't stir even after you've undressed her or prodded her a bit, it's time to call the doctor. Not eating. If your newborn refuses several feedings in a row or seems to be eating less than usual, check with your doctor. Not peeing. A healthy newborn has 6 to 8 wet diapers in 24 hours after day 4 of life. If she has fewer than that, she may be dehydrated. Other signs include sunken eyes and a sunken fontanel (the soft spot on your baby's head), and no tears when crying. Diarrhea. This can be hard to notice in a newborn, especially a breastfeeding one, as she has frequent, soft stools. If you suddenly notice more frequent bowel movements (for example, several while eating) or very watery ones, it could be diarrhea. Call your pediatrician if it goes on for 6-8 diaper changes. Constipation. Your newborn should have a bowel movement at least once a day during the first month. If she doesn't, call your doctor, as the baby may not be eating enough. After that, a formula-fed infant should have one at least one a day, but breastfed infants can go several days or even a week without one. If your baby is 1 month or older and is constipated (no pooping, or hard stool), you can try giving apple or pear juice (1 ounce a day for every month of life, so a 2-month-old would get 2 ounces). If that doesn't help after a day or two, call your pediatrician. A cold that doesn't get better. Even newborns come down with colds. Most of the time, the congestion and runny nose is uncomfortable for your little one but isn't serious. But call the doctor if your baby is so stuffed up she has trouble feeding or sleeping, if she seems especially cranky, or if nasal symptoms last longer than 10-14 days. Vomiting. It's normal for your newborn to spit up small amounts of milk within an hour after being fed. But if the flow is particularly forceful and happens more than two or three times in a day, call your doctor. It could indicate an infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or, in rare cases, pyloric stenosis, a thickening of stomach muscles that requires surgery. Tender belly button or penis. If your baby's umbilical area or penis (for circumcised boys) becomes red or starts to ooze or bleed, it could be a sign of a bacterial infection, and it needs antibiotic treatment right away. Diaper rash that doesn't go away. More than half of all babies get redness around their diaper area. You can treat it with a thick layer of zinc oxide or petroleum, but if it doesn't get better within 48 to 72 hours, bleeds, or you see pus-filled sores, call your doctor. Your baby may have a yeast or bacterial infection and will need medication. If you're worried, pick up the phone. It's always best to err on the side of caution, especially when it comes to newborns. Pediatricians' offices are used to fielding calls from anxious parents and can always help ease your worries or tell you what to do. Before calling your doctor, make sure to have a pen and paper to write down any instructions he might give. You should also have the following information on hand: Her temperature Any medical problems your baby has The names and doses of any medicine your newborn takes Your baby's immunization records</p>",2025-11-25 02:46:34-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Why would you need magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?,MASH,"""Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is a test that uses powerful magnets, radio waves, and a computer to make detailed pictures inside your body.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is a test that uses powerful magnets, radio waves, and a computer to make detailed pictures inside your body. Your doctor can use this test to diagnose you or to see how well you've responded to treatment. Unlike X-rays and computed tomography ( CT) scans, MRIs do not use the damaging ionizing radiation of X-rays. A MRI helps a doctor diagnose a disease or injury, and it can monitor how well you're doing with a treatment. MRIs can be done on different parts of your body. It's especially useful for looking at soft tissues and the nervous system. A MRI of the brain and spinal cord looks for: Blood vessel damage Brain injury Cancer Multiple sclerosis Spinal cord injuries Stroke A MRI of the heart and blood vessels looks for: Blocked blood vessels Damage caused by a heart attack Heart disease Problems with the structure of the heart A MRI of the bones and joints looks for: Bone infections Cancer Damage to joints Disc problems in the spine Neck or low back pain with nerve signs MRIs can also be done to check the health of these organs: Breasts (women) Liver Kidneys Ovaries (women) Pancreas Prostate (men) A special kind of MRI called a functional MRI (f MRI) maps brain activity. This test looks at blood flow in your brain to see which areas become active when you do certain tasks. A f MRI can detect brain problems, such as the effects of a stroke, or for brain mapping if you need brain surgery for epilepsy or tumors. Your doctor can use this test to plan your treatment. Before your MRI, let your doctor know if you: Have any health problems, such as kidney or liver disease Recently had surgery Have any allergies to food or medicine, or if you have asthma Are pregnant, or might be pregnant No metal is allowed in the MRI room, because the magnetic field in the machine can attract metal. Tell your doctor whether you have any metal-based devices that might cause problems during the test. These can include: Artificial heart valves Body piercings Cochlear implants Drug pumps Fillings and other dental work Implanted nerve stimulator Insulin pump Metal fragments, such as a bullet or shrapnel Metal joints or limbs Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) Pins or screws If you have tattoos, talk with your doctor. Some inks contain metal On the day of the test, wear loose, comfortable clothing that doesn't have snaps or other metal fasteners. You might need to take off your own clothes and wear a gown during the test. Remove all of these before you go into the MRI room: Cell phone Coins Dentures Eyeglasses Hearing aids Keys Underwire bra Watch Wig If you don't like enclosed spaces or you're nervous about the test, tell your doctor. You may be able to have an open MRI or get medicine to relax you before the test. A typical MRI machine is a large tube with a hole at both ends. A magnet surrounds the tube. You lie on a table that slides all the way into the tube. In a short-bore system, you are not totally inside the MRI machine. Only the part of your body that's being scanned is inside. The rest of your body is outside the machine. An open MRI is open on all sides. This type of machine may be best if you have claustrophobia -- a fear of tight spaces -- or you're very overweight. The quality of images from some open MRI machines isn't as good as it is with a closed MRI. Before some MRIs, you'll get contrast dye into a vein in your arm or hand. This dye helps the doctor more clearly see structures inside your body. The dye often used in MRIs is called gadolinium. It can leave a metal taste in your mouth. You will lie on a table that slides into the MRI machine. Straps might be used to hold you still during the test. Your body might be completely inside the machine. Or, part of your body may stay outside the machine. The MRI machine creates a strong magnetic field inside your body. A computer takes the signals from the MRI and uses them to make a series of pictures. Each picture shows a thin slice of your body. You might hear a loud thumping or tapping sound during the test. This is the machine creating energy to take pictures inside your body. You can ask for earplugs or headphones to muffle the sound. You might feel a twitching sensation during the test. This happens as the MRI stimulates nerves in your body. It's normal, and nothing to worry about. The MRI scan should take between 20 and 90 minutes. Pregnant women should not get a MRI during their first trimester unless they absolutely need the test. The first trimester is when the baby's organs develop. You also shouldn't get contrast dye when you're pregnant. Don't get contrast dye if you've had an allergic reaction to it in the past or you have severe kidney disease. Certain people with metal inside their body can't get this test, including those with: Some clips used to treat brain aneurysms Pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators Cochlear implants Certain metal coils placed in blood vessels A specially trained doctor called a radiologist will read the results of your MRI and send the report to your doctor.

A MRI of the brain and spinal cord looks for: Blood vessel damage Brain injury Cancer Multiple sclerosis Spinal cord injuries Stroke A MRI of the heart and blood vessels looks for: Blocked blood vessels Damage caused by a heart attack Heart disease Problems with the structure of the heart A MRI of the bones and joints looks for: Bone infections Cancer Damage to joints Disc problems in the spine Neck or low back pain with nerve signs MRIs can also be done to check the health of these organs: Breasts (women) Liver Kidneys Ovaries (women) Pancreas Prostate (men) A special kind of MRI called a functional MRI (f MRI) maps brain activity. This test looks at blood flow in your brain to see which areas become active when you do certain tasks. A f MRI can detect brain problems, such as the effects of a stroke, or for brain mapping if you need brain surgery for epilepsy or tumors. Your doctor can use this test to plan your treatment. Before your MRI, let your doctor know if you: Have any health problems, such as kidney or liver disease Recently had surgery Have any allergies to food or medicine, or if you have asthma Are pregnant, or might be pregnant No metal is allowed in the MRI room, because the magnetic field in the machine can attract metal. Tell your doctor whether you have any metal-based devices that might cause problems during the test. These can include: Artificial heart valves Body piercings Cochlear implants Drug pumps Fillings and other dental work Implanted nerve stimulator Insulin pump Metal fragments, such as a bullet or shrapnel Metal joints or limbs Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) Pins or screws If you have tattoos, talk with your doctor. Some inks contain metal On the day of the test, wear loose, comfortable clothing that doesn't have snaps or other metal fasteners. You might need to take off your own clothes and wear a gown during the test. Remove all of these before you go into the MRI room: Cell phone Coins Dentures Eyeglasses Hearing aids Keys Underwire bra Watch Wig If you don't like enclosed spaces or you're nervous about the test, tell your doctor. You may be able to have an open MRI or get medicine to relax you before the test. A typical MRI machine is a large tube with a hole at both ends. A magnet surrounds the tube. You lie on a table that slides all the way into the tube. In a short-bore system, you are not totally inside the MRI machine. Only the part of your body that's being scanned is inside. The rest of your body is outside the machine. An open MRI is open on all sides. This type of machine may be best if you have claustrophobia -- a fear of tight spaces -- or you're very overweight. The quality of images from some open MRI machines isn't as good as it is with a closed MRI. Before some MRIs, you'll get contrast dye into a vein in your arm or hand. This dye helps the doctor more clearly see structures inside your body. The dye often used in MRIs is called gadolinium. It can leave a metal taste in your mouth. You will lie on a table that slides into the MRI machine. Straps might be used to hold you still during the test. Your body might be completely inside the machine. Or, part of your body may stay outside the machine. The MRI machine creates a strong magnetic field inside your body. A computer takes the signals from the MRI and uses them to make a series of pictures. Each picture shows a thin slice of your body. You might hear a loud thumping or tapping sound during the test. This is the machine creating energy to take pictures inside your body. You can ask for earplugs or headphones to muffle the sound. You might feel a twitching sensation during the test. This happens as the MRI stimulates nerves in your body. It's normal, and nothing to worry about. The MRI scan should take between 20 and 90 minutes. Pregnant women should not get a MRI during their first trimester unless they absolutely need the test. The first trimester is when the baby's organs develop. You also shouldn't get contrast dye when you're pregnant. Don't get contrast dye if you've had an allergic reaction to it in the past or you have severe kidney disease. Certain people with metal inside their body can't get this test, including those with: Some clips used to treat brain aneurysms Pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators Cochlear implants Certain metal coils placed in blood vessels A specially trained doctor called a radiologist will read the results of your MRI and send the report to your doctor. Your doctor will explain the meaning of your test results and what to do next.</p>",2025-11-25 05:09:16-08:00,False,Response is valid.

How can clinical trials help with stage I breast cancer?,MASH,"""Clinical trials are something else to consider. They're open to many women with stage I cancer, and they may allow you access to cutting-edge treatments. Talk to your doctor to find out more about them.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> In this early stage, the cancer either hasn't spread beyond the breast or has spread in a very small amount to a lymph node. You have a number of treatments to choose from. Women usually do well with a combination of treatments. Surgery is standard treatment for this stage. Since the tumor is small, you may have a lumpectomy -- just the tumor and some of the tissue around it are removed. Some women get a mastectomy, in which the whole breast is removed. In either case, the surgeon will likely take out one or more lymph nodes. After a mastectomy, you might choose to have breast reconstruction surgery. Radiation therapy can kill cancer cells that were missed. It's usually given after a lumpectomy. Women with stage I cancer who get a mastectomy sometimes need radiation, too. Chemotherapy after surgery can lower the risk of the cancer coming back. The drugs attack cancer cells. Women who had larger tumors removed are more likely to get chemo. You can get chemo several ways. You may take pills or liquids, but often the drugs are put right into your veins. The treatment is usually given in cycles that allow your body breaks in between. Hormone therapy is a good option after surgery for women who have tumors that use hormones to grow, called hormone receptor-positive cancer. Medication can help prevent tumors from getting hormones. These drugs include tamoxifen for all women, and anastrozole ( Arimidex), exemestane ( Aromasin), and letrozole ( Femara) for postmenopausal women. Women who haven't reached menopause may consider having their ovaries removed to stop making hormones that help cancer grow. Targeted therapy is a newer treatment. About 20% of women with breast cancer have too much of a protein known as HER2 that sometimes makes the cancer spread quickly. Trastuzumab ( Herceptin) is a drug that's been approved to treat women with HER2-positive cancer. It stops this protein from making the cancer grow and makes some chemotherapy more effective.

How can you prevent ear problems in cats?,MASH,"""To help your cat's ears stay perky and pest-free, check inside her ears regularly for signs of wax buildup, inflammation, or odor. If you notice a problem, it's time to talk to your veterinarian.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> You've noticed your feline friend acting odd lately. Maybe she has been shaking her head a lot, or scratching at her ears. Perhaps you've even spotted some yellow or black ear discharge or noticed a bit of a smell. Could your cat have an ear problem? Ear problems in cats are quite common. It's also common for people to misdiagnose their cat's ear issues, sometimes leading to weeks of inappropriate treatment. Save her the pain and discomfort -- learn what ear problems might be troubling your cat, and find out what you can do to help. When your cat's ears are healthy, they're pink and clean inside, have no smell, have very little or no wax, and seem able to detect the sound of a can opener from a mile away. When your feline friend has ear problems, you may notice a much different kitty. Symptoms of ear problems in cats include pawing at the ears, sensitivity to touch, a large amount of cream colored, orange, dark brown, or black wax; hearing loss; head tilting or shaking; and loss of balance. The most common causes of ear discharge in cats include: Ear mites . So tiny you usually need a microscope to see them, ear mites are the most common cause of cat ear problems, and they can be very irritating to your cat. An ear mite infestation can get so bad, that along with a lot of head shaking, your cat may scratch hard enough to create bloody sores; an ear infection may result. Ear infections . This is serious business. Ear infections are not only extremely uncomfortable for your cat, but if left untreated they can lead to permanent deafness or a need for surgery. Ear infections in cats can be caused by many things, including bacteria, yeast, even a piece of debris caught in her ear canal. Other causes . Ear discharge in cats may result from other problems, including food or inhalant allergies, wax buildup, tumors, polyps, drug reactions, a hereditary condition, or immune system issues. The only way to truly know what's troubling your cat is to take her to the vet for an examination. Depending on what your veterinarian finds, treatment for your cat's ear discharge might include: Treating cat ear mites . Ear mites can thrive inside your cat's ear, munching on ear wax and skin oils. Your veterinarian will probably diagnose an ear mite infection by checking a sample of your cat's ear wax under a microscope. Treatment for ear mites generally includes a good ear cleaning and topical prescription medication. For uncooperative cats, injectable medication is also available. Ear mites can be very contagious among pets, so if you discover your cat has them, you may want to get the rest of your household's four-legged friends checked by a vet, too. Chances are good your entire pet household will need ear mite treatment or an infestation may easily recur. Treating cat ear infections . How you treat a cat's ear infection depends on what's causing the infection. To make things more complicated, sometimes your cat may have more than one type of infection in her ears. After examining your cat and possibly sending a swab out to a lab for analysis, your veterinarian may prescribe a range of treatments for your cat's ear infection, including antibiotics, antifungal medication, anti-inflammatories, or immunotherapy. Treating other ear problems . Treatment options for other problems that may lead to ear discharge -- such as allergies, polyps, or drug reactions -- is wide-ranging and may include supplements, drops, immunotherapy shots, a change to their food or medications, or surgery. To help your cat's ears stay perky and pest-free, check inside her ears regularly for signs of wax buildup, inflammation, or odor. If you notice a problem, it's time to talk to your veterinarian.

It can be a big help at a time when you may be looking for relief from pain or new ways to deal with a swirl of intense feelings. Unlike hospice care, which is only given at the end of life, you can get palliative care at any stage of a serious illness, starting at your diagnosis. It can continue for weeks or months, including while you get treatment. Any medical professional -- such as a doctor, nurse, dietitian, pharmacist, or therapist -- can provide palliative care, but there are also specialists in the field. Most hospitals have palliative services, and some have centers that you can visit without having to stay overnight. Your primary care doctor may also be involved in the palliative care you get. One of the most important goals of palliative care is easing the physical symptoms of the cancer itself and any side effects from treatment. Some of the prostate cancer symptoms you can get help with are: Trouble peeing or needing to pee often Problems with erections or ejaculation Loss of sex drive Pain in your lower back, hips, and upper thighs Different pain relief drugs can help, and palliative care specialists are trained to spend time to pick the right medicine for your needs. One common side effect of treatment, especially radiation and hormone therapy, is fatigue. Your palliative care team may recommend exercise and other lifestyle changes that can give you more energy. They may also suggest drugs, changes in diet, physical therapy, or deep breathing to handle other side effects such as nausea, vomiting, trouble breathing, sleeping problems, and lack of appetite. Sometimes chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery are considered 'palliative' because they ease pain by shrinking tumors. The goal of all of these is to make your life more comfortable. Palliative care extends far beyond the physical. Experts can recommend support groups and counselors to help you manage depression, fear, and anxiety. They can also help you open the doors of communication with your partner to talk about sensitive issues like sex. Chaplains and other palliative care professionals can discuss spiritual or religious issues. They can even help you achieve lifelong goals. Palliative care staffers helped one person with cancer, who regretted not marrying his fiancee, to tie the knot right at his bedside. If you decide to stop treatment and move into hospice care, a palliative care team can help with that as well. Your health may not be the only thing on your mind. You may also be worried about having enough money and navigating the insurance maze. You might need legal advice about wills and advanced directives.

How can you get support if you have anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL)?,MASH,"""Find the support you need, and ask for help when you need it. Keep informed about research that's under way. You may be able to take part in a clinical trial. You can find out more information on anaplastic large-cell lymphoma on the web site of the Lymphoma Research Foundation. It has links to help you find the support of people and families who have ALCL, and to information about clinical trials.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma ( ALCL) is a rare type of blood cancer. It's more common in young people, mostly boys. It doesn't run in families. ALCL is a serious illness. It can be fast growing, and it often returns. Treatments can help you fight it. Other therapies can help you feel better. Scientists are still looking for new and better ways to treat both the disease and the symptoms. When you have lymphoma, cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. These are white blood cells that usually fight infection. With ALCL, they build up in small glands called lymph nodes or in other parts of your body, like your lungs or skin. ALCL can show up in two ways: In the skin, it's called cutaneous ALCL. It usually grows slowly. In the lymph nodes and other organs, it's called systemic ALCL. It often spreads quickly. Doctors will also need to find out whether your cancer has a certain protein, called ALK. ALK-positive cancers are more common in young people and usually respond well to chemotherapy. ALK-negative cancers are more common people over 60. This type may need stronger treatment because it is more likely to come back. Researchers don't know what causes ALCL, but they do know it isn't inherited. Often, the first sign of systemic ALCL is swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin, where your legs meet the trunk of your body. You may also have symptoms like: Fatigue Fever Loss of appetite Night sweats Weight loss With cutaneous ALCL, you may first notice one or more raised, red bumps on the skin that don't go away. These are tumors. They can form open sores, and they may itch. When you come in for a visit, your doctor will want to know: When did you first notice changes? Are there any swollen glands? Is there pain? Where? What about appetite? Any weight loss? More tired than usual? Any skin bumps? Do they itch? To see if you have ALCL, doctors may take a biopsy from a swollen lymph node. It's quick and doesn't require a hospital stay. Doctors make a small cut in the skin and remove all or part of the lymph node, or use a needle to take a sample. They look at the cells under a microscope. Other tests may be needed, such as: Blood tests Bone marrow biopsy. Doctors use a special needle to remove a small amount of the soft material inside your bones and check it for cancer cells. Chest X-ray, which uses radiation in low doses to make images of organs in your chest. CT. A powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. MRI, which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures. PET scan, in which radioactive materials called tracers look for cancer. These tests look to see where and how much the cancer has spread. This is called staging. It helps you and your doctor decide the right treatment. Stage I. Cancer is found in lymph nodes in only one part of the body, like the neck or groin. Stage II. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes. All of the lymph nodes are either above or below the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle between your chest and stomach. Stage III. Cancer is found in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm. Stage IV. ALCL has spread to other organs, such as the liver, bones, or lungs. What stage is the cancer? Where exactly have you found cancer? Is it ALK-positive? Have you treated someone with ALCL before? What treatment do you recommend? What are the side effects? How and when will we know if it works? What if it doesn't work? Could I be in a clinical trial? How do I connect with other families facing ALCL? No matter what form of ALCL you have, there are treatments to help. And researchers are hopeful to have new and better options in the future. Your treatment choices will depend on the type of ALCL you have and where it is in the body. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for systemic ALCL, when the cancer is in your lymph nodes and other parts of the body. A kind of chemotherapy called CHOP is used for both ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL. The therapy gets its name for the first letters of the drugs it uses: Cytoxan, hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, and prednisolone. If your cancer is ALK-negative, doctors may use CHOP at higher doses. If your cancer doesn't respond to CHOP, you may get another drug called brentuximab vedotin ( Adcetris). A stem cell transplant may also be an option for you, but it's a complicated and risky procedure. It's usually only done when other treatments have failed. Doctors inject stem cells into your body to help you grow new cancer-free ones. The stem cells come from your own body, or from a closely matched donor. For primary cutaneous ALCL, treatment may include: Radiation, which uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells Surgery to remove the tumors If the cancer is in many areas of the skin, you may need a combination of chemotherapy drugs. Being diagnosed with cancer can make you feel like you've lost control. Remember that you're in charge of your treatment decisions and how you live your life. While you are getting treatment, you may not feel your best. Some treatments, like chemotherapy, have side effects. You may feel weak or tired, and you may be sick to your stomach To help you feel better: Eat enough calories and protein each day to keep up weight and stay strong. Try several small meals instead of fewer bigger ones. Ask the doctor or nurse for ways to ease nausea and other side effects of treatment. Get support from friends, family members, counselors, or members of your spiritual community. You can also join a support group of other people with ALCL. Stay active. Exercise when you feel up to it. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you. Try to get good rest. Wash hands often, and stay away from people who may be sick. Don't miss regular doctor appointments. They're key to finding out how well the treatment is going, and to deciding if any changes are needed. Every situation is different, but treatment to fight ALCL can work well. Sometimes, the cancer comes back. Ask your doctor what to watch for, and listen to your body. The treatments can bring discomfort. Make sure your doctor knows how you're feeling. Take advantage of other therapies that can ease symptoms and help you feel better. A serious illness is hard for the whole family. It's natural that you will have questions, concerns, and frustrations. Find the support you need, and ask for help when you need it. Keep informed about research that's under way. You may be able to take part in a clinical trial. You can find out more information on anaplastic large-cell lymphoma on the web site of the Lymphoma Research Foundation.

They look at the cells under a microscope. Other tests may be needed, such as: Blood tests Bone marrow biopsy. Doctors use a special needle to remove a small amount of the soft material inside your bones and check it for cancer cells. Chest X-ray, which uses radiation in low doses to make images of organs in your chest. CT. A powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. MRI, which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures. PET scan, in which radioactive materials called tracers look for cancer. These tests look to see where and how much the cancer has spread. This is called staging. It helps you and your doctor decide the right treatment. Stage I. Cancer is found in lymph nodes in only one part of the body, like the neck or groin. Stage II. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes. All of the lymph nodes are either above or below the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle between your chest and stomach. Stage III. Cancer is found in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm. Stage IV. ALCL has spread to other organs, such as the liver, bones, or lungs. What stage is the cancer? Where exactly have you found cancer? Is it ALK-positive? Have you treated someone with ALCL before? What treatment do you recommend? What are the side effects? How and when will we know if it works? What if it doesn't work? Could I be in a clinical trial? How do I connect with other families facing ALCL? No matter what form of ALCL you have, there are treatments to help. And researchers are hopeful to have new and better options in the future. Your treatment choices will depend on the type of ALCL you have and where it is in the body. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for systemic ALCL, when the cancer is in your lymph nodes and other parts of the body. A kind of chemotherapy called CHOP is used for both ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL. The therapy gets its name for the first letters of the drugs it uses: Cytoxan, hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, and prednisolone. If your cancer is ALK-negative, doctors may use CHOP at higher doses. If your cancer doesn't respond to CHOP, you may get another drug called brentuximab vedotin ( Adcetris). A stem cell transplant may also be an option for you, but it's a complicated and risky procedure. It's usually only done when other treatments have failed. Doctors inject stem cells into your body to help you grow new cancer-free ones. The stem cells come from your own body, or from a closely matched donor. For primary cutaneous ALCL, treatment may include: Radiation, which uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells Surgery to remove the tumors If the cancer is in many areas of the skin, you may need a combination of chemotherapy drugs. Being diagnosed with cancer can make you feel like you've lost control. Remember that you're in charge of your treatment decisions and how you live your life. While you are getting treatment, you may not feel your best. Some treatments, like chemotherapy, have side effects. You may feel weak or tired, and you may be sick to your stomach To help you feel better: Eat enough calories and protein each day to keep up weight and stay strong. Try several small meals instead of fewer bigger ones. Ask the doctor or nurse for ways to ease nausea and other side effects of treatment. Get support from friends, family members, counselors, or members of your spiritual community. You can also join a support group of other people with ALCL. Stay active. Exercise when you feel up to it. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you. Try to get good rest. Wash hands often, and stay away from people who may be sick. Don't miss regular doctor appointments. They're key to finding out how well the treatment is going, and to deciding if any changes are needed. Every situation is different, but treatment to fight ALCL can work well. Sometimes, the cancer comes back. Ask your doctor what to watch for, and listen to your body. The treatments can bring discomfort. Make sure your doctor knows how you're feeling. Take advantage of other therapies that can ease symptoms and help you feel better. A serious illness is hard for the whole family. It's natural that you will have questions, concerns, and frustrations. Find the support you need, and ask for help when you need it. Keep informed about research that's under way. You may be able to take part in a clinical trial. You can find out more information on anaplastic large-cell lymphoma on the web site of the Lymphoma Research Foundation.

How can you get support if you have anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL)?,MASH,"""Get support from friends, family members, counselors, or members of your spiritual community. You can also join a support group of other people with ALCL. Stay active"".   ","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma ( ALCL) is a rare type of blood cancer. It's more common in young people, mostly boys. It doesn't run in families. ALCL is a serious illness. It can be fast growing, and it often returns. Treatments can help you fight it. Other therapies can help you feel better. Scientists are still looking for new and better ways to treat both the disease and the symptoms. When you have lymphoma, cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. These are white blood cells that usually fight infection. With ALCL, they build up in small glands called lymph nodes or in other parts of your body, like your lungs or skin. ALCL can show up in two ways: In the skin, it's called cutaneous ALCL. It usually grows slowly. In the lymph nodes and other organs, it's called systemic ALCL. It often spreads quickly. Doctors will also need to find out whether your cancer has a certain protein, called ALK. ALK-positive cancers are more common in young people and usually respond well to chemotherapy. ALK-negative cancers are more common people over 60. This type may need stronger treatment because it is more likely to come back. Researchers don't know what causes ALCL, but they do know it isn't inherited. Often, the first sign of systemic ALCL is swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin, where your legs meet the trunk of your body. You may also have symptoms like: Fatigue Fever Loss of appetite Night sweats Weight loss With cutaneous ALCL, you may first notice one or more raised, red bumps on the skin that don't go away. These are tumors. They can form open sores, and they may itch. When you come in for a visit, your doctor will want to know: When did you first notice changes? Are there any swollen glands? Is there pain? Where? What about appetite? Any weight loss? More tired than usual? Any skin bumps? Do they itch? To see if you have ALCL, doctors may take a biopsy from a swollen lymph node.

Should I have prunes and liquids to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation?,MASH,"""Try prunes and liquids. Some fruity foods that are higher in the sugar sorbitol, such as prunes, dried plums (another name for prunes), and prune juice, can loosen bowels.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> If you have IBS- C, you may be concerned about what to eat. You need to keep a balanced diet while you avoid foods that trigger symptoms for you. Try a few simple tips to make your diet work better for you. An IBS symptom journal can help you and your doctor figure out which foods may trigger your symptoms. Make a habit of writing down any symptoms you might have, along with what and how much you ate beforehand. If you see a pattern with certain foods, see if you feel better when you don't eat them, or cut back on how much of them you eat. But cut foods one at a time. If you cut several foods at the same time, you won't know for sure which one may be causing your symptoms. These tips can help you come up with your own healthy new meal plan: Limit highly refined foods. These foods lose some important nutrients in the process of making them. They fill you up but don't give you the fiber, vitamins, and minerals you need. Think twice before you eat: White bread White rice Chips Cookies and pastries Boost fiber. Fiber makes stool easier to pass. It helps many people with IBS- C symptoms, but not everyone. Too little roughage in your diet can make it hard to have a bowel movement. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends 25 grams of fiber for women and 38 grams for men each day. People over age 50 may need a little less fiber (21 grams for women and 30 grams for men). You can get fiber in foods such as: Whole-grain bread and cereals Fruits Vegetables Beans Although meeting your daily fiber needs is best accomplished by eating the right foods, taking a fiber supplement can also help. Examples include psyllium, methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil. Don't shock your system with a sudden increase of fiber, though. Your body will need time to get used to it, so add a little each day. Too much at once may make you feel worse. Try increasing your intake by 2 grams to 3 grams per day. For example, if you normally eat 5 grams of fiber, try getting 8 grams on your first day and go from there. If it helps, stick with it until you're getting as much as experts recommend. Try prunes and liquids. Some fruity foods that are higher in the sugar sorbitol, such as prunes, dried plums (another name for prunes), and prune juice, can loosen bowels. But again, too much can cause gas, bloating, cramping, and diarrhea. Some people find ground flaxseed helps ease their IBS- C symptoms. You can sprinkle it on salads, cooked vegetables, and cereals. Keeping yourself well-hydrated can help, too. Drink plenty of liquids like water and juice. But coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcohol can dehydrate you and make your IBS- C symptoms worse. Keep some carbs. Be mindful of low-carb diets. A high-protein and low-carb diet can cause constipation. You need protein, but don't cut out the carbs from fruits and vegetables. They'll help keep your digestive track working. Some simple changes may help you gain control of your IBS- C symptoms. Eat smaller meals more often. Some people with IBS- C find it helps to eat five or six smaller meals throughout the day, rather than three large ones. Don't skip breakfast. This meal, more than any other, can get your colon active. Dine at leisure. Too often we eat on the run or at our desks. But eating in a rush can trigger IBS- C symptoms. Try not to do other things while you're eating, such as drive or sit in front of the computer.

For those who do, what they eat may make a difference between a good day (or night) and a bad one. Diet can play an important role in controlling the symptoms of hiatal hernia, namely heartburn and acid indigestion. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } When you have a hiatal hernia, it is easier for stomach acids to come up into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from your throat to your stomach. This causes a burning feeling in your throat and chest. Certain foods can make these symptoms worse for some people. Fortunately, heartburn symptoms associated with hiatal hernia often can be controlled with diet and lifestyle changes. The following foods are highly acidic or may weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, making it easier for stomach acids to back up into your esophagus. They may cause heartburn symptoms. Citrus foods, such as oranges, grapefruits, and lemons, and orange juice, grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, and lemonade Chocolate Fatty and fried foods, such as fried chicken and fatty cuts of meat Garlic and onions Spicy food Peppermint and spearmint Tomato-based foods such as spaghetti sauce, pizza, chili, salsa, and tomato juice Coffee, tea (including decaffeinated versions), and alcohol Carbonated beverages Dairy products, such as whole milk, ice cream, and creamed food. Try soy milk; it may be a good milk substitute. Also, mild cheeses, like feta or goat, may be enjoyed in moderation. Oil and butter The following foods are low-acid-producing foods and are less likely to aggravate your hiatal hernia symptoms: Bananas and apples Green beans, peas, carrots, and broccoli Grains, like cereals (bran and oatmeal), bread, rice, pasta, and crackers Low-fat or skim milk and low-fat yogurt Fat-free cheeses, cream cheese, and fat-free sour cream Lean meat, chicken, and fish Water Pretzels, graham crackers, rice cakes, and baked potato chips Low-fat sweets (no chocolate or mint) You may find that some of the foods listed under 'foods to avoid' may not bother you, while others on the 'foods to enjoy' list may cause discomfort. Everyone tolerates food differently. To determine the best diet for you, keep a food diary for a few weeks. And then avoid anything that causes you to have symptoms. A good way to enjoy the foods listed above is to cook them in a healthy way. Here are some heartburn-friendly cooking tips: Choose lean meats, such as skinless chicken, meat with little visible fat, ground turkey instead of ground beef, and fish. Lean beef cuts include round, chuck, sirloin, or loin. Lean pork cuts include tenderloin or loin chop. Bake or broil foods instead of frying. Skim off fat from meat during cooking. Go easy on seasoning. Most seasonings are OK as long as they are not spicy but should be used in moderation. Substitute low-fat dairy foods, such as low-fat yogurt, for ice cream. Steam your vegetables with water only. Limit butter, oils, and cream sauces. Use cooking spray instead of cooking oil when sautÃ©ing. Choose low-fat or nonfat ingredients over full-fat products. Get creative. There are all kinds of ways to modify recipes. Don't be afraid to try new things. In addition to making adjustments to what you eat and how you cook, changing certain habits may lessen heartburn symptoms too, including: Do not overeat. Instead, eat small, frequent meals. And take your time. Eating fast can make heartburn symptoms worse. Avoid lying down or going to sleep for at least three hours after a meal. Do not bend over right after eating. Do not smoke. Lose weight, if necessary. Wear loose-fitting clothes so as to not add extra pressure on your stomach. Raise the head of your bed 6 to 8 inches with wood blocks or some other sturdy objects. Propping your head up with pillows probably won't give you the relief you need. If these diet and lifestyle tips don't help, or you need additional relief, over-the-counter antacids and acid-reducing or blocking drugs may help control your heartburn symptoms. Talk to your doctor to learn more about over-the-counter or prescription medications to treat your symptoms. Surgery may be needed in rare cases. Hiatal hernia symptoms can be bothersome. But most people feel better after they adjust their diet and lifestyle.</p>",2025-11-25 03:47:28-08:00,False,Response is valid.

When should I talk to a doctor about managing hiatal hernia?,MASH,"""Talk to your doctor to learn more about over-the-counter or prescription medications to treat your symptoms. Surgery may be needed in rare cases"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Many people with hiatal hernia, a condition in which part of the stomach bulges upward through an opening in the diaphragm, have no symptoms. For those who do, what they eat may make a difference between a good day (or night) and a bad one. Diet can play an important role in controlling the symptoms of hiatal hernia, namely heartburn and acid indigestion. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } When you have a hiatal hernia, it is easier for stomach acids to come up into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from your throat to your stomach. This causes a burning feeling in your throat and chest. Certain foods can make these symptoms worse for some people. Fortunately, heartburn symptoms associated with hiatal hernia often can be controlled with diet and lifestyle changes. The following foods are highly acidic or may weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, making it easier for stomach acids to back up into your esophagus. They may cause heartburn symptoms. Citrus foods, such as oranges, grapefruits, and lemons, and orange juice, grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, and lemonade Chocolate Fatty and fried foods, such as fried chicken and fatty cuts of meat Garlic and onions Spicy food Peppermint and spearmint Tomato-based foods such as spaghetti sauce, pizza, chili, salsa, and tomato juice Coffee, tea (including decaffeinated versions), and alcohol Carbonated beverages Dairy products, such as whole milk, ice cream, and creamed food. Try soy milk; it may be a good milk substitute. Also, mild cheeses, like feta or goat, may be enjoyed in moderation. Oil and butter The following foods are low-acid-producing foods and are less likely to aggravate your hiatal hernia symptoms: Bananas and apples Green beans, peas, carrots, and broccoli Grains, like cereals (bran and oatmeal), bread, rice, pasta, and crackers Low-fat or skim milk and low-fat yogurt Fat-free cheeses, cream cheese, and fat-free sour cream Lean meat, chicken, and fish Water Pretzels, graham crackers, rice cakes, and baked potato chips Low-fat sweets (no chocolate or mint) You may find that some of the foods listed under 'foods to avoid' may not bother you, while others on the 'foods to enjoy' list may cause discomfort. Everyone tolerates food differently. To determine the best diet for you, keep a food diary for a few weeks. And then avoid anything that causes you to have symptoms. A good way to enjoy the foods listed above is to cook them in a healthy way. Here are some heartburn-friendly cooking tips: Choose lean meats, such as skinless chicken, meat with little visible fat, ground turkey instead of ground beef, and fish. Lean beef cuts include round, chuck, sirloin, or loin. Lean pork cuts include tenderloin or loin chop. Bake or broil foods instead of frying. Skim off fat from meat during cooking. Go easy on seasoning. Most seasonings are OK as long as they are not spicy but should be used in moderation. Substitute low-fat dairy foods, such as low-fat yogurt, for ice cream. Steam your vegetables with water only. Limit butter, oils, and cream sauces. Use cooking spray instead of cooking oil when sautÃ©ing. Choose low-fat or nonfat ingredients over full-fat products.

How can I help the challenge of vision loss?,MASH,"""There are steps you can take to better cope with the condition, including: You can order written or taped materials on vision loss through state agencies and non-profit organizations. You may also find it helpful to discuss vision loss with your doctor, as well as other people who have lost vision"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Vision loss is a difficult condition, but fortunately there are many low vision aids that can help you cope day to day. If you are reading this you probably do not have low vision or you are already using these tools. Perhaps you know someone who is struggling, so pass on this information. Some eye conditions, like diabetic retinopathy and certain corneal diseases, can be treated so that vision is restored or maintained. Unfortunately, some eye conditions cannot be treated, resulting in low vision or blindness. While one obvious challenge of vision loss is restoring mobility and function, there is also the emotional toll of vision loss to consider. There are steps you can take to better cope with the condition, including: You can order written or taped materials on vision loss through state agencies and non-profit organizations. You may also find it helpful to discuss vision loss with your doctor, as well as other people who have lost vision. While vision loss can occur at any age, it occurs most often among mature adults. Like any other major life event, vision loss can bring feelings of loneliness, helplessness, anxiety, and depression. Doctors, state agencies, and non-profit organizations offer counseling services for those with vision loss and can provide referrals to other professionals based on individual needs. People with severe vision loss especially should be encouraged to consider these resources. The loss of vision is initially devastating. Understanding the process of grief associated with vision loss can help you and your loved ones cope with these physiological and emotional challenges. Tasks as simple as dressing in the morning or as complex as cooking a meal become new challenges after vision loss. In adjustment classes, individuals can learn new or alternative techniques to help maintain independence. While building mobility and motor skills, these classes and aids also teach the patience and confidence required to live with low vision on a daily basis. A variety of low vision aids are very useful. Popular low vision aids include: Telescopic glasses Lenses that filter light Magnifying glasses Hand magnifiers Closed-circuit television Reading prisms These devices are stronger than regular eyeglasses and can be hand-held or stationary. You can also buy computer software that can alter screen images or read typed text to make new technology and electronic information readily available. Non-optical aids are also helpful in daily activities. These devices 'talk' to you, or offer enlarged print or Braille. Many also have special features, such as high contrast, that make them easier to see. Some popular non-optical devices include: Text reading software Braille readers Check guides High contrast clocks and watches Talking watches and clocks Large-print publications Clocks, phones, and watches with enlarged numbers Low vision clinics and agencies are available in many locations which can help people choose the most helpful vision aids and services for their personal visual problem.</p>",2025-11-25 10:51:26-08:00,False,Response is valid.
When should I call my doctor about shingles?,MASH,"""You develop any strange symptoms with the shingles rash, such as vertigo, buzzing in your ears, rapid onset weakness, double vision, face droop, or confusion.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The symptoms of shingles include: Localized burning, tingling, itching, prickling pain that starts days days to weeks before the rash appears. The pain varies by person but can be constant or come and go. Days after these symptoms appear, a group of fluid-filled blisters appears on a red, inflamed base of skin; the blisters typically crust over in a week. The rash may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, or headache. The rash will not cross the mid-line of your body. You suspect an outbreak is beginning. If you take antiviral drugs in the early stages, you may shorten the course of the infection. You have the rash anywhere on your face. This puts you at risk of herpes zoster in the eye, which can lead to corneal damage and vision problems.

Can you prevent a broken arm?,MASH,"""There are 2 main ways to help prevent a broken arm. Wear appropriate personal safety equipment as protection. Wearing car seat belts, using wrist guards for in-line skating and skateboarding, and wearing appropriate pads for contact sports are all good ways to prevent bone fractures. Prevent and treat osteoporosis, the disease that causes bone loss, especially in older women"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> A broken or fractured arm means that one or more of the bones of the arm have been cracked. This is a common injury occurring in both children and adults. In adults, fractures of the arm account for nearly half of all broken bones. In children, fractures of the forearm are second only to broken collarbones. The arm consists of 3 major bones. The humerus runs from the shoulder to the elbow. This is called the upper arm, or, simply, the arm. At the elbow, the humerus connects with 2 bones: the radius and the ulna. These bones go from the elbow to the wrist and are regarded as the forearm. Almost all injuries to the arm that result in a broken bone are caused in 2 ways: falls and direct trauma. The typical fall that produces a fracture occurs when you fall on your outstretched hand. The location of the fracture can be from the wrist up to the shoulder depending on the direction of the fall, the age of the person, and other factors that modify the stresses applied to the bone. Direct trauma can be from a direct blow from an object such as a bat, the trauma during a car accident, or any accident that causes the direct application of force to a part of the arm. Most broken arms have these symptoms: A large amount of pain and increased pain when moving the arm Swelling Maybe an obvious deformity compared to the other arm Possible open wound either from the bone puncturing the skin or from the skin being cut during the injury Decreased sensation or inability to move the limb, which may indicate nerve damage Call your doctor after an accident if these signs are present: Significant pain that is not relieved by ice and home pain medications such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Motrin) A large amount of swelling or mild deformity of the arm compared to the opposite arm Significant pain with use or limited use of the affected arm Pain in one specific part of the arm when it is pressed Your doctor may advise you to go directly to a hospital's emergency department. Under the following conditions, go directly to the hospital for emergency care: Visible bone sticking out through the skin Heavy bleeding from an open wound Complete lack of movement or sensation of part of the arm Obvious deformity that looks drastically different from the usual appearance Loss of consciousness Many other injuries The initial evaluation by any physician, in the office or in the emergency department, begins with a thorough history and physical exam. By finding out the details of the accident, the doctor may be able to determine what damage was done based on the mechanism of the trauma. After taking a history, the physician will do a complete physical exam with special focus on the painful areas. The doctor is looking for signs of a fracture (such as swelling or deformity) and checking for possible nerve or blood vessel damage. X-rays are typically the test used to assess for broken bones. At least 2 views of the arm are taken. Initially, most broken bones will have an apparent fracture or other abnormality on the x-ray. Some fractures are not always visible on the first set of x-rays. In those instances, a CT scan or MRI may be done immediately for further evaluation, or follow-up x-rays may be obtained at a later date. The most important aspect of first aid is to stabilize the arm. Do this by using a towel as a sling. Place it under the arm and then around the neck. An alternate approach to keep the arm from moving is to position a rolled and taped newspaper along the swollen area and to tape it in place. Apply ice to the injured area. This can help to decrease pain and swelling. Place ice in a bag and leave it on the arm for 20-30 minutes at a time. It may be helpful to place a towel around the ice bag or in between the bag and the skin to protect the skin from getting too cold. Never put ice directly on the skin. The most important aspect of treating fractures is to determine which ones can be treated with outpatient care and which require admission to the hospital. In most instances, the broken arm will be able to be treated in the emergency department. Most fractures will need to have a splint or partial cast applied to stabilize the broken bones. Some breaks especially in the upper arm and shoulder may only need to be immobilized in a sling. In addition to splinting the broken arm, the physician will prescribe medicines for pain control and ice to decrease swelling. Typically, wounds that warrant admission to the hospital are these: Bones that have gone through the skin or have lacerations over the broken area Fractures that are associated with nerve damage Fractures that are associated with blood vessel damage Complicated fractures that have multiple breaks, involve the joints, or are unable to be stabilized in the emergency department or doctor's office Most broken arms will not require admission to the hospital. For all other fractures, the treating doctor will suggest you follow up with an orthopedic doctor (bone specialist). At that time, the orthopedist will determine what further care (continued splinting, casting, or surgery) is necessary based on the type of fracture. Additional follow-up instructions for fractures include the following: Wear any support device (splint, sling, or brace, for example) until the doctor sees you for follow-up. Keep your splint or cast clean and dry. Apply ice to the injured area for 20-30 minutes 4-5 times a day. Keep your arm elevated above the heart as much as possible to decrease swelling. Use pillows to prop your arm while in bed or sitting in a chair. Take pain medicine as prescribed. Do not drink or drive if you are taking narcotic pain medication. Call your doctor for increased pain, loss of sensation, or if your fingers or hand turn cold or blue. There are 2 main ways to help prevent a broken arm.

Wearing car seat belts, using wrist guards for in-line skating and skateboarding, and wearing appropriate pads for contact sports are all good ways to prevent bone fractures. Prevent and treat osteoporosis, the disease that causes bone loss, especially in older women. These women tend to have more fractures as they age. In this group, the use of calcium supplements and estrogen replacement would help to reduce the number of fractures resulting from weakened bones. The best treatment for osteoporosis is prevention. This is best done early in life by building stronger bones through a good diet and exercise. Women of all ages should discuss techniques for prevention and treatment of ongoing osteoporosis with their doctor. The majority of fractures heal and normal arm movement is restored. Many of these factors based on the individual injury and medical history may determine the final outcome of a broken bone: Earlier treatment usually improves results. Fractures in younger children and adolescents tend to heal better. Fractures that have multiple breaks, involve a joint, have open wounds, or become infected could have healing complications. Older adults have increased chance of losing some ability or movement in the broken arm. Chronic diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes may slow the healing process.

What does it mean if you have a lack of appetite or nausea if you have heart failure?,MASH,"""Because blood is being moved away from your digestive system, your appetite may not be as big as it usually is. You might also feel sick to your stomach.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> If you or a loved one has heart failure, you probably know how important good daily habits are to treatment. A healthy weight, active lifestyle, and proper medication are all key ways to take charge of the disease. But even you've been carefully following doctor's orders, it's crucial to keep an eye out for the return of symptoms. That's because heart failure can be under control for a time and then become an issue again. Keep up with your regular checkups, and know which symptoms may mean your treatment needs to be tweaked. When your heart can't properly fill and empty, blood backs up in your veins. This causes fluid to leak into your lungs. Your doctor may call it pulmonary edema. This can make it hard to breathe during activities, rest, or even sleep. A sudden lack of breath might wake you up. You may need to prop yourself up with extra pillows to breathe easier. This constant search for air can leave you tired and anxious. When your heart doesn't pump right, the body starts to move blood from less vital parts like your arms and legs to the centers for survival -- the heart and brain. This can leave you feeling exhausted after everyday activities. An ongoing wheeze or cough that brings up white or slightly blood-colored mucus can signal fluid building up in your lungs. Call the doctor if you notice it. Fluid can build up in your tissues just like it does in your lungs. As a result, your feet, ankles, legs, or belly may swell. Your shoes and socks to feel tight. You might notice a sudden weight gain. Because blood is being moved away from your digestive system, your appetite may not be as big as it usually is. You might also feel sick to your stomach. When your heart struggles to pump the right amount of blood, it may speed up to make up for it. This can lead to palpitations, which could cause your heart to race or feel like it's fluttering or throbbing. Unusual amounts of things like sodium in your blood can bring disorientation, confusion, or memory loss. If you've seen any of these seven red flags, get medical help right away.

Can you prevent a Baker's cyst?,MASH,"""Possibly -- by preventing knee injuries in the first place. Wear the right shoes when you work out. Be sure to warm up before you exercise. And if you do get a knee injury, take care of it right away"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> A Baker's cyst is a fluid-filled sac behind your knee. It often causes a bulge and a feeling of tightness. You might hear your doctor call it a popliteal cyst. They might not cause any symptoms, but symptoms of a Baker's cyst may include: Swelling behind your knee Swelling in your leg Knee pain Stiffness -- you won't be able to bend your knee Causes of a Baker's cyst may include: Swelling in the knee . This happens when the fluid that lubricates your knee joint increases. When pressure builds up, fluid squeezes into the back of the knee and creates the cyst. Arthritis. People with all forms of arthritis often have Baker's cysts. Injury. A sports-related injury or other blow to the knee can cause A Baker's cyst. Gout . This a type of arthritis, which results from the buildup of uric acid in the blood, can lead to a Baker's cyst. See your doctor if you have any of the symptoms listed above and they're causing problems. They'll examine you to rule out conditions that are more serious, like a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis). He may also order an imaging test, like an ultrasound or MRI, to get a better look. You may not need any treatment for a Baker's cyst. They aren't dangerous and tend to go away on their own. In the meantime, try these at-home remedies to ease your pain and make yourself more comfortable: Keep it cold. Apply a cold pack to the affected area. It'll help keep the swelling down. A compression wrap might also help. Relieve pain. For pain (and to reduce inflammation), take an over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen. Rest your leg.

When should you call your doctor or dentist about black hairy tongue?,MASH,"""Call your doctor or dentist if the problem doesn't get better on its own"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The name black hairy tongue may sound scary, but the condition is harmless. Black hairy tongue is caused by bacteria or fungi in the mouth, which make the tongue appear black and hairy. It's easily remedied by good old-fashioned oral hygiene. A black hairy tongue is caused by too much bacteria or yeast growth in the mouth. The bacteria build up on tiny rounded projections called papillae. These lie along the surface of the tongue. Instead of shedding as they normally do, the papillae start to grow and lengthen, creating hair-like projections. They can grow to 15 times their normal length. Normally, the papillae are pinkish-white. But as they grow, pigments from food, drinks, and possibly the bacteria or yeast themselves get caught in the papillae, dyeing the tongue a color. Most often that color is black, hence the name. But the tongue can also turn brown, yellow, green, or a variety of other colors. Certain lifestyle habits and conditions can make people more likely to develop black hairy tongue. They include: poor oral hygiene smoking tobacco drinking a lot of coffee or tea using antibiotics (which may disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the mouth) being dehydrated taking medications that contain the chemical bismuth (such as Pepto- Bismol for upset stomach) not producing enough saliva regularly using mouthwash that contains peroxide, witch hazel, or menthol getting radiation therapy to the head and neck Black hairy tongue is more common in men, people who use intravenous drugs, and those who are HIV-positive. Other than the appearance of the tongue, most people with black hairy tongue don't have any symptoms or feel any discomfort. The exception is when there is too much growth of the yeast Candida albicans, which can cause a burning sensation on the tongue. This burning sensation is called glossopyrosis. Some people complain of a tickling feeling in the back of the roof of the mouth, a metallic taste in their mouth, or nausea. In more severe cases, the condition may lead to a gagging feeling. Sometimes, food getting caught inside the extra-long papillae can cause bad breath. Practicing good oral hygiene is the best way to treat black hairy tongue. Gently brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Also, brush your tongue. You can use a tongue scraper to make sure you're thoroughly cleaning the area. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help keep your mouth clean. Other tips include: If you smoke, quit. Add more roughage to your diet. Soft foods won't clean off the tongue effectively. Call your doctor or dentist if the problem doesn't get better on its own. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or an antifungal drug to get rid of the bacteria or yeast. Topical medications, such as tretinoin ( Retin- A), are also sometimes prescribed.

How do you treat pustules or cysts?,MASH,"""Wash your face and neck twice daily with mild soap and warm water. But never scrub your face! That can irritate your skin and worsen acne. Whether you have a few pimples or more serious acne, talk to your primary health care provider about treatments.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> If there's one thing you can count on as a teen, it's acne. More than 85% of teenagers have this common skin problem, which is marked by clogged pores (whiteheads, blackheads), painful pimples, and, sometimes, hard, deep lumps on the face, neck, shoulders, chest, back, and upper arms. If your mom and dad had acne, chances are good that you will, too. But there are many ways to prevent (and treat) acne today to keep the condition minimal, prevent scarring, and leave your skin glowing. To understand acne, you need to know how your skin works. The pores in your skin contain oil glands. When you hit puberty, there's an increase in sex hormones called androgens. The excess hormones cause your oil glands to become overactive, enlarge, and produce too much oil, or sebum. When there's too much sebum, the pores or hair follicles become blocked with skin cells. The increase in oil also results in an overgrowth of bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes. If blocked pores become infected or inflamed, a pimple -- a raised red spot with a white center -- forms. If the pore clogs, closes, and then bulges, you have a whitehead. A blackhead occurs when the pore clogs, stays open, and the top has a blackish appearance due to oxidation or exposure to air. ( This has nothing to do with skin being 'dirty'). When bacteria grow in the blocked pore, a pustule may appear, meaning the pimple becomes red and inflamed. Cysts form when the blockage and inflammation deep inside pores produce large, painful lumps beneath the skin's surface. Hormonal changes related to birth control pills, menstrual periods, and pregnancy can trigger acne. Other external acne triggers include heavy face creams and cosmetics, hair dyes, and greasy hair ointment -- all of which can increase blockage of pores. Clothing that rubs your skin may also worsen acne, especially on the back and chest. So can heavy sweating during exercise, and hot, humid climates. Stress is known to trigger increased oil production, which is why many teens have a new crop of pimples on the first day of school or just before that big date. While the symptoms of acne vary in severity, you'll notice these signs on areas of your body with the most oil glands (the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms): Clogged pores (pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads) Papules (raised lesions) Pustules (raised lesions with pus) Cysts (nodules filled with pus or fluid) The least severe type of acne lesion is the whitehead or blackhead. This type is also the most easily treated. With more extensive acne, you may need prescription medications to ease inflammation, bacterial infection, redness, and pus. The treatment usually depends on how serious the problem is. For instance, if you have an occasional inflamed pimple, you may use skin compounds containing: Azelaic acid Benzoyl peroxide Glycolic acid Lactic acid Retinoids (medications that come from vitamin A) Salicylic acid Various fruit acids Benzoyl peroxide reduces oil production and has antibacterial properties. But use it carefully, as it might leave your skin dry and flaky. ( It can also bleach out clothing, towels and bedsheets.) Try to use it just before bedtime. Resorcinol and sulfur, as well as prescription retinoids and prescription antibiotics applied to skin, can reduce blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed pustules. When many pustules or cysts appear on the face and upper body, you'll need an oral antibiotic. Your doctor also can inject cysts with anti-inflammatory steroid solutions to help decrease their size. For persistent acne, antibiotics (taken by mouth or applied to the skin) are generally used. Some antibiotics have both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. These are often prescribed for short-term use (usually a few months). Because acne is linked to hormones, some oral contraceptives (birth control pills) may help. But not all birth control pills stop acne, and some make it worse. Spironolactone, a hormone blocker, can be used for teenage girls who have acne. Isotretinoin, a prescription medication you take orally, may help control severe acne, which is characterized by many large cysts on the face, neck, and upper trunk and scarring. Pregnant women or women who might become pregnant can't use this medication, as it's linked to birth defects. Isotretinoin can give people very dry skin, eye dryness, and irritation and requires blood tests to monitor for liver inflammation, high blood fat content, and bone marrow suppression. It can also be very expensive. So its use is restricted to the most severe cases for which other treatments haven't worked. There are some steps you can take to prevent acne. To prevent oily skin that can contribute to acne, keep your skin clean. Wash your face and neck twice daily with mild soap and warm water. But never scrub your face! That can irritate your skin and worsen acne. Whether you have a few pimples or more serious acne, talk to your primary health care provider about treatments.

More than 85% of teenagers have this common skin problem, which is marked by clogged pores (whiteheads, blackheads), painful pimples, and, sometimes, hard, deep lumps on the face, neck, shoulders, chest, back, and upper arms. If your mom and dad had acne, chances are good that you will, too. But there are many ways to prevent (and treat) acne today to keep the condition minimal, prevent scarring, and leave your skin glowing. To understand acne, you need to know how your skin works. The pores in your skin contain oil glands. When you hit puberty, there's an increase in sex hormones called androgens. The excess hormones cause your oil glands to become overactive, enlarge, and produce too much oil, or sebum. When there's too much sebum, the pores or hair follicles become blocked with skin cells. The increase in oil also results in an overgrowth of bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes. If blocked pores become infected or inflamed, a pimple -- a raised red spot with a white center -- forms. If the pore clogs, closes, and then bulges, you have a whitehead. A blackhead occurs when the pore clogs, stays open, and the top has a blackish appearance due to oxidation or exposure to air. ( This has nothing to do with skin being 'dirty'). When bacteria grow in the blocked pore, a pustule may appear, meaning the pimple becomes red and inflamed. Cysts form when the blockage and inflammation deep inside pores produce large, painful lumps beneath the skin's surface. Hormonal changes related to birth control pills, menstrual periods, and pregnancy can trigger acne. Other external acne triggers include heavy face creams and cosmetics, hair dyes, and greasy hair ointment -- all of which can increase blockage of pores. Clothing that rubs your skin may also worsen acne, especially on the back and chest. So can heavy sweating during exercise, and hot, humid climates. Stress is known to trigger increased oil production, which is why many teens have a new crop of pimples on the first day of school or just before that big date. While the symptoms of acne vary in severity, you'll notice these signs on areas of your body with the most oil glands (the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms): Clogged pores (pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads) Papules (raised lesions) Pustules (raised lesions with pus) Cysts (nodules filled with pus or fluid) The least severe type of acne lesion is the whitehead or blackhead. This type is also the most easily treated. With more extensive acne, you may need prescription medications to ease inflammation, bacterial infection, redness, and pus. The treatment usually depends on how serious the problem is.

Also, try to measure your blood pressure at about the same time each day. Your doctor may want you to check your blood pressure several times during the day to see if it fluctuates. Find a quiet place to check your blood pressure. You will need to listen for your heartbeat. Make sure that you are comfortable and relaxed with a recently emptied bladder (a full bladder may affect your reading). Roll up the sleeve on your arm or remove any tight-sleeved clothing. Rest in a chair next to a table for 5 to 10 minutes. Your arm should rest comfortably at heart level. Sit up straight with your back against the chair, legs uncrossed. Rest your forearm on the table with the palm of your hand facing up. If you purchase a manual or digital blood pressure monitor (sphygmomanometer), follow the instruction booklet carefully. The following steps provide an overview of how to take your left arm blood pressure on either a manual or digital blood pressure monitor. Simply reverse the sides to take a blood pressure in your right arm. 1. Locate your pulse Locate your pulse by lightly pressing your index and middle fingers slightly to the inside center of the bend of your elbow (where the brachial artery is). If you cannot locate your pulse, place the head of the stethoscope (on a manual monitor) or the arm cuff (on a digital monitor) in the same general area. 2. Secure the cuff Slide the cuff onto your arm, making sure that the stethoscope head is over the artery (when using a manual monitor.) The cuff may be marked with an arrow to show the location of the stethoscope head. The lower edge of the cuff should be about 1 inch above the bend of your elbow. Use the fabric fastener to make the cuff snug, but not too tight. Place the stethoscope in your ears. Tilt the ear pieces slightly forward to get the best sound. 3. Inflate and deflate the cuff If you are using a manual monitor: Hold the pressure gauge in your left hand and the bulb in your right. Close the airflow valve on the bulb by turning the screw clockwise. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb with your right hand. You may hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Watch the gauge. Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads about 30 points (mm Hg) above your expected systolic pressure. At this point, you should not hear your pulse in the stethoscope. Keeping your eyes on the gauge, slowly release the pressure in the cuff by opening the airflow valve counterclockwise. The gauge should fall only 2 to 3 points with each heartbeat. ( You may need to practice turning the valve slowly.) Listen carefully for the first pulse beat. As soon as you hear it, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats). Continue to slowly deflate the cuff. Listen carefully until the sound disappears. As soon as you can no longer hear your pulse, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats). Allow the cuff to completely deflate. You'll get the most accurate reading if your arm is held straight. If you released the pressure too quickly or could not hear your pulse, DO NOT inflate the cuff again right away. Wait one minute before repeating the measurement. Start by reapplying the cuff. If you are using a digital monitor: Hold the bulb in your right hand. Press the power button. All display symbols should appear briefly, followed by a zero. This indicates that the monitor is ready. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb with your right hand. If you have a monitor with automatic cuff inflation, press the start button. Watch the gauge. Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads about 30 points (mm Hg) above your expected systolic pressure. Sit quietly and watch the monitor. Pressure readings will be displayed on the screen. For some devices, values may appear on the left, then on the right. Wait for a long beep. This means that the measurement is complete. Note the pressures on the display screen. Systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats) appears on the left and diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats) on the right. Your pulse rate may also be displayed in between or after this reading. Allow the cuff to deflate. If you did not get an accurate reading, DO NOT inflate the cuff again right away. Wait one minute before repeating the measurement. Start by reapplying the cuff. 4. Record your blood pressure. Follow your doctor's instructions on when and how often you should measure your blood pressure. Record the date, time, systolic and diastolic pressures. You should also record any special circumstances like any recent exercise, meal, or stressful event.

How can MRI and MRCP help diagnose EPI?,MASH,"""MRCP is a special kind of MRI that focuses on your bile ducts and ducts in your pancreas"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> When you have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI), you probably know your body doesn't feel right. Still, it's not always easy for doctors to diagnose your condition. The classic symptoms of EPI -- weight loss, greasy and foul-smelling stools that float or are tough to flush, stomach cramps, and diarrhea -- mimic the telltale signs of many other digestive diseases. You might even have one of those diseases along with EPI, like Crohn's or celiac disease. That makes it hard for doctors to know exactly which condition is causing you trouble. To add to the confusion, not everyone with EPI has the same classic symptoms. Other warning signs can be too subtle for you to notice. To figure out what's going on, your doctor will use tests to see how many nutrients your body is absorbing from food. Here's a rundown of the tests she might use. Blood work. Your doctor will take a sample of your blood and send it to a lab to check it for anemia, a condition in which your body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells. The lab will also test your blood for vitamin B12, iron, and folate. If the levels are too low, that can mean EPI is keeping your body from absorbing these nutrients. The lab might also look for a chemical your pancreas makes to help with digestion called trypsinogen. A level that's too high is a sign of a problem. Fecal elastase test. You'll give your doctor a solid stool sample. The lab will check it for an enzyme your pancreas makes to help your body digest protein, called elastase. If you have EPI, the amount might be less concentrated than normal. 3-day fecal test. You'll need to collect samples of your stool in special containers for about 3 days and give them to your doctor. The lab will test them for the amount of fat they have. CT scan. This machine looks like a giant doughnut. It takes special X-rays that show your tissues and blood vessels, along with your bones. You'll lie on a padded table that slides you up so the machine is over your upper tummy. The doctor may take one set of images and then ask you to drink a kind of dye (they'll call it contrast) to get a better picture of the area. Tell your doctor if you've had a bad reaction to the dye in the past or if you're allergic to shellfish, like shrimp, crab, lobster, oysters, scallops, clams, or mussels. A basic scan takes about 10-15 minutes, but if you need contrast, you'll be there longer. Endoscopic ultrasound. Your doctor might need to take a closer look at your pancreas and other organs to see if they're damaged or inflamed. In a hospital, doctors will put a thin tube in your mouth, down through your stomach, and into the first part of your small intestine. At the tip is an ultrasound probe that gives off sound waves. They help make a picture of the inside of your body, which doctors can see on a screen. You might be asleep or awake for the test, but you'll get medicine to make you more comfortable. The test usually takes 20 to 45 minutes, and you won't need to stay in the hospital overnight. During this test, your doctor can also take a small piece of your tissue to study under a microscope -- if he needs one. MRI and MRCP. The MRI machine uses a magnet to take detailed pictures of your insides. You'll lie on a padded table, and it will slide until your upper belly is under the magnet. You'll be awake for it, but if you get anxious in small, tight spaces, the doctor might give you a drug to help you relax. You won't have to stay overnight in the hospital.

A common use for hawthorn has been to try to treat heart problems, especially heart failure. During heart failure, the heart can't properly do its job of pumping blood around the body. Problems like coronary heart disease and high blood pressure can lead to heart failure. In one study that combined the results of earlier studies on people with heart failure, hawthorn extract was linked to fewer symptoms of heart failure.

It is not known how hawthorn might affect cholesterol levels in humans. Blood pressure. Hawthorn may lower blood pressure. In one study, people with type 2 diabetes who took hawthorn extract for four months had a drop in diastolic blood pressure -- the bottom number in a blood pressure reading. But hawthorn can interact with many different types of blood pressure medications. More research is needed. Optimal doses of hawthorn have not been set for any condition.

Can you eat hawthorn?,MASH,"""Native Americans, Europeans, and Chinese people have long used the hawthorn shrub, including its fruit, leaves, and flowers, as a remedy for health problems.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Native Americans, Europeans, and Chinese people have long used the hawthorn shrub, including its fruit, leaves, and flowers, as a remedy for health problems. Researchers are still looking into hawthorn as a treatment for disease. People take hawthorn to try to treat conditions that include: Heart problems. A common use for hawthorn has been to try to treat heart problems, especially heart failure. During heart failure, the heart can't properly do its job of pumping blood around the body. Problems like coronary heart disease and high blood pressure can lead to heart failure. In one study that combined the results of earlier studies on people with heart failure, hawthorn extract was linked to fewer symptoms of heart failure. People taking hawthorn had less fatigue and shortness of breath. But other studies have shown no benefit. There have also been reports of increased rates of death and hospitalization. More research is needed. Cholesterol. Research on animals shows that hawthorn extract lowers levels of total cholesterol and LDL 'bad' cholesterol. It is not known how hawthorn might affect cholesterol levels in humans. Blood pressure. Hawthorn may lower blood pressure. In one study, people with type 2 diabetes who took hawthorn extract for four months had a drop in diastolic blood pressure -- the bottom number in a blood pressure reading. But hawthorn can interact with many different types of blood pressure medications. More research is needed. Optimal doses of hawthorn have not been set for any condition. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely from maker to maker. This makes it hard to set a standard dose. Hawthorn fruit can be eaten as food. The fruits are also canned and processed into jam, candy, and drinks. Side effects. Unwanted effects from hawthorn seem to be rare. Dizziness is the most common side effect. Other side effects include: Agitation Digestive distress Fast heart rate Fatigue Headache Nausea Skin outbreaks Sweating Trouble breathing Trouble sleeping Risks. Avoid using if you are allergic to hawthorn or plants in the hawthorn family. Also avoid using hawthorn if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, as little is known about its safety in these cases. Interactions. Hawthorn may increase the effect of certain drugs. For instance, it may increase the effect of drugs that: Affect heart-muscle contraction, like digoxin Lower blood pressure Cause blood vessels to dilate, like nitrates Hawthorn may also decrease the effect of drugs that cause blood vessels to contract.

What symptoms should I look out for within 72 hours of my liver biopsy?,MASH,"""If these symptoms occur within 72 hours of the biopsy, call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room: Fever Dizziness Chills Difficulty breathing Chest pain Abdominal swelling or bloating Increasing abdominal pain Tenderness or severe pain or redness at the site of the biopsy or in the shoulder, chest, or abdomen""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> A liver biopsy is a procedure in which a small needle is inserted into the liver to collect a tissue sample. The tissue is then analyzed in a laboratory to help doctors diagnose a variety of disorders and diseases in the liver. A liver biopsy is most often performed to help identify the cause of: Persistent abnormal liver blood tests (liver enzymes) Unexplained yellowing of the skin (jaundice) A liver abnormality found on ultrasound, CT scan, or nuclear scan Unexplained enlargement of the liver A liver biopsy can also be used to estimate the degree of liver damage, to grade and stage hepatitis B and C, and to determine the best treatment for the damage or disease. In most instances, there are no complications in obtaining a liver biopsy. However, rarely, internal bleeding may occur, as well as a leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder. There is a slight risk of a pneumothorax, also called a collapsed lung, if the biopsy needle makes a hole in the chest wall causing air to enter. When preparing for a liver biopsy, you should: Tell your doctor if you're pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, are allergic to any medications, or have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medications such as aspirin, Coumadin, Plavix, or Eliquis. Your doctor may prescribe an alternate method for thinning your blood before the procedure. Talk with your doctor about the procedure. Have any necessary blood tests done. Find out how long before the procedure you'll need to stop eating. Arrange for a ride home after the procedure. For the week before the procedure, do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Naprosyn, or Indocin) unless otherwise advised by your doctor. Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor. Laboratory tests will be performed on the day of a liver biopsy or 2-3 days before the procedure, as directed by your doctor. These tests may include a blood count, a platelet count, and a measurement of your blood's ability to clot. Before the procedure: A doctor will explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications, and answer any questions you may have. During the procedure, which takes about 5 minutes: You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back, with your right elbow out to the side and your right hand under your head. It is important that you remain as still as possible during the procedure. An ultrasound may be used to mark the location of your liver. You may receive a small dose of a sedative just prior to the procedure. The doctor will clean and numb an area on your upper abdomen with a local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication). The doctor will then make a small incision on your upper abdomen and insert a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis. After the procedure: You will stay in a recovery room for up to 4 hours for observation. You may feel minor pain or soreness at the biopsy site and discomfort or a dull pain in your shoulders or back. If necessary, a pain medication will be prescribed for you. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after the procedure. Avoid taking aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Naprosyn, Indocin, or Motrin) for one week after the procedure. You may take acetaminophen ( Tylenol) if needed. Do not perform vigorous physical activity or heavy lifting for at least 24 hours and up to 1 week after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the biopsy results with you several days after the procedure. Two other methods of liver biopsy may also be available: laparoscopic and transvenous. During a laparoscopic biopsy, a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the doctor watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver. A transvenous biopsy may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver. A biopsy needle is placed into the catheter and then into the liver to obtain a sample.

How do I reduce osteoarthritis (OA) pain?,MASH,"""If you already have osteoarthritis, these same steps can be useful for reducing pain and other symptoms. In addition, there are many treatments your doctor can recommend or prescribe. They range from over-the-counter pain relievers to injections of corticosteroids or other compounds and, eventually, surgery to replace the painful, damaged joint.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> By age 65, more than half of us will have X-ray evidence of osteoarthritis, a disease in which the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones at the joints breaks down and bony overgrowth occurs. For many, the result is stiffness and pain in the joint. Although osteoarthritis (or OA) is more common as we age, it is not an inevitable part of aging. As researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis, they are able to offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and lessen its impact on your life. Here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. If you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. If you are overweight, losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. Obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES), a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of Americans, showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. The risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. Being overweight strains the joints, particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees, hips, and joints of the feet, causing the cartilage to wear away. Weight loss of at least 5% of body weight may decrease stress on the knees, hips, and lower back. In a study of osteoarthritis in a population in Framingham, Mass., researchers estimated that overweight women who lost 11 pounds or about two body mass index ( BMI) points, decreased their risk of osteoarthritis by more than 50%, while a comparable weight gain was associated with an increased risk of later developing knee OA. If you already have osteoarthritis, losing weight may help improve symptoms. If the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak, research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. Fortunately, even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles, the quadriceps, can reduce the risk. To strengthen quadriceps, Todd P. Stitik, MD, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, recommends isometric moves and wall slides. To do these, stand with your back to a wall, with feet shoulder-width apart. Then lean back against the wall, placing your feet out in front of you as far as you comfortably can. Bend at the knees, put your hands on your waist, and slide with your spine, maintaining contact with the wall until you reach a sitting position. ( Your knees should not bend more than 90 degrees). Then slowly slide back to your original position. Repeat eight to 10 times. If fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising, try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers. Doing so may make it easier to exercise and stay active. The safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints, such as bicycling, swimming, and other water exercise. Light weight lifting is another option, but if you already have osteoarthritis, first speak with your doctor. Suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. Injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. A long-term study of 1,321 graduates of Johns Hopkins Medical School found that people who injured a knee in adolescence or young adulthood were three times more likely to develop osteoarthritis in that knee, compared those who had not suffered an injury. People who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. To avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recommends the following: Avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. Keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. When jumping, land with knees bent. Do warm-up exercises before sports, even less vigorous ones such as golf. Cool down after vigorous sports. Wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. Exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. If you have a joint injury, it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage, such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. Although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis, certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. They include: Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats reduce joint inflammation, while unhealthy fats can increase it. Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils, including walnut, canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, and olive. Vitamin D. A handful of studies has shown that vitamin D supplements decreased knee pain in people with osteoarthritis. Your body makes most of the vitamin D it needs in response to sunlight. You can get more vitamin D in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and herring; vitamin D-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs. If you already have osteoarthritis, these same steps can be useful for reducing pain and other symptoms. In addition, there are many treatments your doctor can recommend or prescribe. They range from over-the-counter pain relievers to injections of corticosteroids or other compounds and, eventually, surgery to replace the painful, damaged joint.</p>",2025-11-25 04:43:53-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. When jumping, land with knees bent. Do warm-up exercises before sports, even less vigorous ones such as golf. Cool down after vigorous sports. Wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. Exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. If you have a joint injury, it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage, such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. Although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis, certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. They include: Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats reduce joint inflammation, while unhealthy fats can increase it. Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils, including walnut, canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, and olive. Vitamin D. A handful of studies has shown that vitamin D supplements decreased knee pain in people with osteoarthritis. Your body makes most of the vitamin D it needs in response to sunlight. You can get more vitamin D in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and herring; vitamin D-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs. If you already have osteoarthritis, these same steps can be useful for reducing pain and other symptoms. In addition, there are many treatments your doctor can recommend or prescribe. They range from over-the-counter pain relievers to injections of corticosteroids or other compounds and, eventually, surgery to replace the painful, damaged joint.</p>",2025-11-25 05:12:18-08:00,False,Response is valid.

How do I recover from abdominal surgery to prevent inguinal hernia?,MASH,"""Surgery can prevent strangulation, and it's the only way to fix an inguinal hernia. The doctor will push the bulging tissue back inside and strengthen your abdominal wall with stitches and perhaps mesh. She might be able to do this through a small cut in your belly using a special tool -- a procedure called laparoscopy -- which means you'll probably hurt less and heal faster than traditional surgery.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> If you feel a pain in your groin when you cough or lift something heavy, you may have what doctors call an inguinal hernia. It happens when a part of the small intestine or fat pushes through a weak area of your lower abdominal wall. This type of hernia is named for the inguinal canal. That's a passage in the lower abdominal wall that houses blood vessels and nerves, as well as the spermatic cord in boys and men, and ligaments that support the uterus in girls and women. An inguinal hernia could be a serious health problem, so you shouldn't ignore symptoms. A physical exam is usually all it takes to diagnose the problem. If the hernia is large enough, you'll need surgery to fix it. A baby can get an indirect inguinal hernia if the lining of their abdomen doesn't fully close while they're developing. What's left is an opening at the upper part of the inguinal canal. That's where a hernia can take shape. Older adults usually get a direct inguinal hernia because the muscles of their abdominal wall can weaken. Women rarely have this type of hernia. The broad ligament of the uterus is right behind the abdominal wall, which supports it and shields the inguinal canal. Men don't have that barrier, so stress and gradual weakening of their abdominal muscles over time make it more likely something can push through to the inguinal canal. It happens in 2% to 3% of male babies, but less than 1% of baby girls. About 1 in 4 males will have one at some time in their life. It's most common in men over the age of 40. Abdominal surgery can make you more likely to develop a direct inguinal hernia. A family history of this condition raises your odds, too. Smokers may have a higher chance of having inguinal hernias, as well as many other health problems. You can't prevent being born with a weaker abdominal wall. But you can take steps to avoid having problems because of it, such as not smoking and keeping your weight in check. If you have abdominal surgery, be careful afterward: Use your legs, not your back, when lifting. Avoid lifting heavy things. Try not to strain when you poop. You could have a direct inguinal hernia if you: Hurt when you cough, bend, or lift something heavy Feel pressure or weakness in your groin Have swelling around your testicles You may be able to gently push the bump back up into your abdomen to relieve some of the discomfort. See your doctor if you have symptoms of an inguinal hernia. Your doctor will check your groin area for swelling or a bulge. He'll probably ask you to stand and cough. This can make a hernia more obvious. If it hasn't produced any swelling that the doctor can see, he may order imaging tests, like an abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. In some cases, if your hernia isn't treated, you could develop a serious complication called 'strangulation.' It happens when the small intestine gets stuck in the inguinal canal and can't be moved or massaged back into the abdomen. As a result of being 'strangled,' the intestines lose their blood supply. The affected part of the intestines can die. This is a major medical emergency. If you have an inguinal hernia and your belly hurts a lot, don't wait -- call 911. If you have an inguinal hernia, a high-fiber diet with plenty of veggies, fresh fruits, and whole grains may help you avoid constipation, which can lead to painful symptoms. Surgery can prevent strangulation, and it's the only way to fix an inguinal hernia. The doctor will push the bulging tissue back inside and strengthen your abdominal wall with stitches and perhaps mesh. She might be able to do this through a small cut in your belly using a special tool -- a procedure called laparoscopy -- which means you'll probably hurt less and heal faster than traditional surgery. An inguinal hernia can be quite painful, but it's definitely treatable. If you think you have one, see your doctor. It won't get better on its own.</p>",2025-11-25 04:36:05-08:00,False,Response is valid.
How can you wash crusty lashes to treat dry eyes?,MASH,"""To help ease irritation and loosen clogged oils, wet a clean washcloth with warm water, wring it out, and place it over your closed eye for at least a minute.

This condition can happen when the tiny glands in and around your eyelids don't make enough tears to keep your peepers healthy and vision clear. When tears do their job well, they keep the surface of the eye smooth, comfortable, and hydrated, and wash away dust and debris and protect it from infection. Healthy eyes make tears all day, every day, to stay moist. But sometimes certain diseases, medications, or even just getting older causes your eyes to make fewer tears. Dry eye can also happen when your eyes don't make the right type of tears to clear out particles or keep the surface well-lubricated. What you do to make your baby blues, browns, or greens more comfortable depends on what's causing your dry eyes. In some cases, your doctor may need to treat an underlying issue or disease; or she may prescribe special medications to help your eyes make more of their own tears, or suggest ways to stop tears from draining away from your eyes too quickly. There are also steps you can take yourself to ease the scratchy, irritating symptoms of dry eyes. Try these simple home remedies to find relief: Tears are made of oil, water, and mucus. Your eyes need all three parts to stay moist and healthy. Inflamed and flaky eyelids may clog the oil-making glands along the edge of your lid and lead to dry eye.

So try to blink often when you're online. Follow the 20/20 rule: close your eyes every 20 minutes for 20 seconds. Another simple trick to keep your eyes moist when at the computer: Set your screen below eye level. You won't have to open your eyes as wide, which may help slow tear evaporation between blinks. Salmon and tuna, for example, or sardines, trout, and mackerel all contain omega-3 fatty acids. Research suggests these healthy fats help the oil-making glands in your eye work better, which can ease irritation. Other foods naturally high in omega-3 fats include walnuts, vegetable oils (like canola and soybean oil), and flaxseed. You can also take omega-3 fatty acids as a pill or tablet. Talk your doctor before you start any new supplement, just to make sure it won't affect any conditions you have or medicines you take. Every part of your body needs water to stay healthy, including your eyes. Drinking water helps keep them moist. But don't wait until you're thirsty to sip water. By then, you may already be slightly dehydrated. Instead, aim for eight to 10 glasses throughout the day. If you don't like plain water, any other liquid that doesn't have alcohol or caffeine will do. Water-rich foods -- like cucumbers and watermelon -- also count. One way to know if you are well-hydrated: Check your pee. If it's colorless or light yellow, you're likely getting enough fluids. This style can help protect your eyes from drying winds, which cause tears to evaporate more quickly. At home, avoid blowing air from your hair dryer, air conditioner, or fan toward your eyes. This can add moisture to dry indoor air. Putting a pan of water near your heat or radiator has the same effect. An air cleaner that filters dust and other particles may also help prevent dry eyes. Over-the-counter eye drops work just like your own tears and may help. There are many different brands. Some have preservatives added so they last longer, but using those too often may irritate your eyes. Non-preservative eye drops are also available, as well as thicker ointments.

What can I do about dry skin?,MASH,"""Use moisturizer after you bathe while your skin is still damp. Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated. Use a humidifier. Make your shower quick, and don't use very hot water. Use mild soaps.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> You might have an itch that must be scratched. Or a tickle on your back that you can't reach. It's often hard to pin down just what's causing it. It may be as simple as the clothes you wear. But it can also be a symptom of something more serious, like a rash or an illness. Start with the simplest solutions. Try a different fabric, take care of your skin, and avoid anything that seems to trigger the itch. If that doesn't help, ask your doctor, who will check on the cause and the treatment you need. Is Your Skin Dry? If your skin is dry, it will let you know with an itch. It can be especially bad in the winter and in places where the air is dry. As you get older, it becomes even more common. To ease the itch of dry skin: Use moisturizer after you bathe while your skin is still damp. Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated. Use a humidifier. Make your shower quick, and don't use very hot water. Use mild soaps. Learn more about how to prevent itching caused by dry skin. Is There a Rash? If you start scratching and find a rash, it's likely the problem is in your skin. It can happen because of: Fungal and bacterial infections like impetigo and folliculitis. See a photo of what impetigo looks like. Bugs: When you get bitten by a mosquito or spider, you know it. Bites from bedbugs and mites can be harder to diagnose because they look like rashes. Lice can cause a crawling sensation in your scalp or pubic hair, along with an intense itch. See a photo of what bedbug bites look like. Eczema or atopic dermatitis: It shows up on your skin as dry, scaly patches or a bumpy rash. It isn't clear what causes it, but it's extremely itchy. Kids are more likely to get it if their family has a history of asthma and allergies. Certain food allergies can make it worse. So does scratching. See a photo of what eczema looks like. Contact dermatitis: This itchy rash is caused by a reaction to something touching your skin. You may have to do some detective work to figure out where it's coming from. It could be the metals in your jewelry or the chemicals in cosmetics, toiletries, and cleaning products. Poison ivy is also a form of contact dermatitis. Stop using or wearing whatever you think might be the cause and see if the itching gets better. See a photo of what a poisonous plant rash looks like. Is It Beneath the Surface? Your skin may let you know when something is not quite right inside your body. This itch can be a symptom of deeper problems. Hives: You get them from allergies. They look like raised welts that show up alone or in clusters, and they are usually itchy. Stress, heat, exercise, or exposure to the sun can also bring them out. See a photo of what hives look like. Psoriasis: It makes your body overproduce skin cells, which pile up in itchy, inflamed patches on the skin's surface. This is a result of an overactive immune system. See a photo of what psoriasis looks like. Pregnancy: More than 1 in 10 pregnant women say itching is a problem. The reasons range from harmless rashes to more serious conditions. Learn more about skin conditions in pregnancy. Medications: Some may make your skin itch, even with no signs of a rash or irritation. Check with your doctor if the itch becomes too uncomfortable. These drugs are known to make you start scratching. Certain high blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors Allopurinol for gout Amiodarone for heart rhythm problems Pills called diuretics that relieve bloating Estrogen Hydroxyethyl cellulose (used during surgery) Prescription pain drugs called opioids Simvastatin for high cholesterol Is It Related to Your Nerves? Your nervous system can get confused when it's sick and accidentally tell the nerves on the skin to start itching when there's nothing there to cause it. There is no rash. But your skin may appear irritated if you've been scratching a lot. You can get it from: Shingles Multiple sclerosis Stroke Brain tumor Nerve damage Is It Psychological?

How can I save up energy to combat fatigue?,MASH,"""There are times when fatigue may be a clue to an underlying medical problem. Other times, there may be things your doctor can do to help control fatigue.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> You're likely to have some fatigue while you're getting treated for breast cancer. That's one of the most common side effects of the disease and treatments for it. Fatigue isn't the same as being tired. Tiredness happens to everyone, and a good night's sleep usually re-energizes you. Fatigue is a daily lack of energy or whole-body tiredness that doesn't go away, even with good sleep. It can keep you from doing normal, daily things, and it affects your quality of life. Sometimes it's 'acute,' meaning it lasts a month or less. In other cases it's 'chronic' and lasts up to 6 months or longer. Usually, it comes on suddenly, and may continue after you're done with your treatment. Here are some possible reasons for it, along with tips to help you get some of your energy back. The disease itself can be the problem. Tumor cells steal calories and nutrients from normal cells, and that leads to tiredness that won't seem to let up. Treatments can cause fatigue, too: Chemotherapy . Any chemo drug can cause you to have fatigue. It lasts for a few days in some people, while others say they have it throughout treatment or even afterward. Radiation can give you fatigue that tends to get worse over time. It usually lasts 3 to 4 weeks after your treatment stops, but it can continue for up to 3 months. Hormone therapy deprives the body of estrogen, and that can lead to fatigue that may last throughout your treatment or longer. Bone marrow transplant . This aggressive form of treatment can give you a daily lack of energy that lasts up to 1 year. Targeted therapy. High amounts of these medications can lead to long-lasting fatigue. Combination therapy. Getting more than one cancer treatment at the same time or one after the other also increases your chances of feeling listless. Surgery. Everyone recovers from surgery at different rates. This can also cause some daily exhaustion. Cancer treatments can cause anemia, a blood disorder where your body's cells don't get the oxygen they need. And side effects of treatments -- such as nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, taste changes, heartburn, or diarrhea -- can lower the amount of nutrition you get, which can make you feel worn-out. Medicines used to treat side effects like nausea, pain, depression, anxiety, and seizures can cause fatigue, too. So can hormonal changes related to medications. If your thyroid gland is underactive, your metabolism may slow down so much that your body doesn't burn food fast enough to give you energy. This is a common condition, but it can also happen after radiation therapy to the lymph nodes in the neck. In older people, being less active and having problems moving around can lead to fatigue. Younger people in treatment sometimes overexert themselves and bring on daily lack of energy or whole-body tiredness. Chronic, severe pain makes it worse. Stress doesn't help, either. Fatigue often happens when people try to keep their normal daily routines and activities during treatment. Changing your activities can help you save energy. Depression and fatigue often go hand in hand, but it may not be clear which started first. One way to sort this out is to try to understand your depressed feelings and how they affect your life. Let your doctor know if you feel depressed all the time, were depressed before your cancer diagnosis, or are preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness. The first step is to try to figure out the source or sources of your fatigue. There may be more than one reason you're feeling this way. Your doctor can do tests to check for anemia or hypothyroidism. If you have one of these conditions, treatments can help. If you think your cancer treatment is the cause, you can talk to your doctor about ways to help you manage it, or discuss other options. Figure out your level of energy. Keep a diary for 1 week. Write down the times of day when you're most fatigued, and the times when you have the most energy. Note what you think might be the reasons why. Know the warning signs of fatigue: Tired eyes Tired legs Whole-body tiredness Stiff shoulders Trouble concentrating Weakness or malaise Boredom or lack of motivation Exhaustion, even after sleeping Irritability Nervousness, anxiety, or impatience 1. Plan ahead, and organize your work. Combine activities and simplify details. Ask family members or friends to help you with tasks when possible. 2. Pace yourself. A moderate pace is better than rushing through your day. 3. Balance periods of rest and work. Use your energy only on important tasks. Schedule rest before you become fatigued -- frequent, short breaks are helpful. 4. Alternate sitting and standing. When you sit, use a chair with good back support. Sit up with your back straight and your shoulders back. 5. Try to work without bending over. Adjust the level of your work instead. When you have to lift something, bend your knees and use your leg muscles to lift, not your back. 6. Limit work that requires reaching over your head or that adds to muscle tension. Change where you store items to reduce trips or reaching. Rather than moving a large load, break it into smaller ones, or use a cart. 7. Breathe evenly, and wear comfortable clothes to allow for free and easy breathing. 8. Avoid too-hot or too-cold temperatures. Don't take long, hot showers or baths. Cancer-related fatigue can get worse if you're not eating enough or if you're not eating the right foods. A balanced diet can help you feel better and have more energy. Here are some ways to improve your diet: Get enough calories. If you have cancer, you need about 15 calories per pound of weight if your weight has been stable. Add 500 calories per day if you've lost weight. For example, a person who weighs 150 pounds needs about 2,250 calories per day to maintain his or her weight. Get plenty of protein. It rebuilds and repairs damaged cells. Women need about 46 grams per day, and men need 56 grams. Good sources of protein include dairy foods, meat, eggs, and beans. Drink plenty of fluids. That will help you avoid fatigue that comes from dehydration. And it'll help you get calories. Drink things like water, juice, milk, broth, and milkshakes. Avoid drinks with caffeine. Also, you'll need more fluids if you have vomiting or diarrhea. Get enough vitamins. Ask your doctor whether you should take a vitamin supplement if you're not sure you're getting enough nutrients. A multivitamin provides many of the nutrients your body needs. But vitamin supplements don't have calories, so make sure you eat nutritious foods to get your calories. Consider seeing a registered dietitian. They can help you with any eating problems that may be keeping you from getting proper nutrition (such as problems swallowing, changes in tastes, or feeling full quickly). A dietitian can also suggest ways to get more calories and protein in smaller amounts of food. Your cancer and treatments may make you feel drained, leaving you lying in bed or sitting in chairs for hours. But that sort of inactivity can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, weakness, and further fatigue. Regular, moderate exercise can ease those feelings, help you stay active, and give you more energy. Even during your cancer treatment, you may be able to keep exercising. Here are some tips: Check with your doctor before you begin an exercise program. Start slowly if you get the OK. Give your body time to adjust. Keep a regular exercise schedule. Try to be active at least 150 minutes a week. If you're just starting, build up to this amount over time. The right kind of exercise never makes you feel sore, stiff, or exhausted. If you that happens or you feel out of breath, you're overdoing it. Swimming, brisk walking, stationary cycling, and low-impact aerobics (taught by a certified instructor) might be good choices. But talk to your doctor if you have any questions about exercises that are safe for you. Managing stress can play an important role in fighting fatigue. Here are some suggestions that may help. Adjust your expectations. For example, if you have a list of 10 things you want to accomplish today, pare it down to two and leave the rest for other days. A sense of accomplishment goes a long way toward easing stress. Help others understand and support you. Family and friends can be helpful if they can put themselves in your shoes and understand what fatigue means to you. Cancer support groups can be a source of strength, too. Other people with the disease may understand what you're going through. Relaxation techniques like deep breathing or visualization can lower stress, too. Or just do low-key things that are fun for you -- read, listen to music, or knit, for example. Let your doctor know if your stress seems out of control. He can help you feel better. Although cancer-related fatigue is a common side effect of cancer and its treatments, you should mention any of your concerns to your doctor. There are times when fatigue may be a clue to an underlying medical problem. Other times, there may be things your doctor can do to help control fatigue. Be sure to let your doctor or nurse know if you have: Shortness of breath Pain Side effects from treatments (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite) Anxiety or nervousness Depression</p>",2025-11-25 03:31:40-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Can I get a flu shot if I have psoriasis?,MASH,"""There should be no problem getting a flu shot during an active psoriasis flare -- just make sure the flu vaccine you receive does not contain any live virus.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> For some people with psoriasis, fall and winter bring shorter days, colder temperatures, and worsening psoriasis symptoms. Don't despair. You don't need to tough it out until spring, counting the days until you get some relief from psoriasis. Here are answers to seven frequently asked questions about psoriasis in fall and winter. Dry air and low levels of exposure to sunlight's ultraviolet rays likely cause worsening psoriasis symptoms during fall and winter. Not only are the winter days shorter, but most people tend to spend less time outside. And, when they do brave the elements, they're usually bundled up from head to toe. UVB rays are most prevalent at noontime in the spring and summer. All of these things add up to much less ultraviolet light from the sun, which may ease psoriasis in spring and summer. Experts believe that ultraviolet light hinders the rapid growth of skin cells that is characteristic of psoriasis. So you may find that your psoriasis is more likely to flare and your plaques worsen when you spend less time in the sun. Also, the lack of humidity in the air outside and the dry heat in most buildings during the colder months can rob your skin of the moisture it needs. You may be able to alleviate dryness-related psoriasis symptoms by regularly moisturizing your skin and using a humidifier at home. If possible, humidify your office, too. Definitely don't go running off to the tanning booth -- there are safer ways to get your psoriasis-easing ultraviolet rays. The medical use of light rays to treat psoriasis is known as phototherapy. A variety of options exist, which can be done in a doctor's office, psoriasis clinic, or even the comfort of your home. The form of light known as ultraviolet light B ( UVB) seems to be the most beneficial for treating psoriasis. Your doctor may prescribe a certain amount of UVB exposure depending on your symptoms. If your doctor does choose this form of light therapy for your psoriasis, ask whether you should consider purchasing a home UVB unit. Other phototherapy options for psoriasis treatment include the use of ultraviolet light A ( UVA) in conjunction with special medications that respond to these light rays. This is rarely used, however, because it can cause skin cancer. Looking for a reason to take a getaway to some tropical locale? It could be just what the doctor ordered to ease your psoriasis symptoms. The beneficial effects of a sunny vacation in the middle of winter could help ease psoriasis symptoms for a few months. Alcohol and key foods probably will not trigger a psoriasis flare. Though medical researchers have yet to prove that certain foods cause psoriasis flares, many patients report that eating certain foods seems to worsen their psoriasis. This, though, may be a coincidence. If you notice a regular connection between eating certain foods and increased skin symptoms, ask your doctor whether you can safely eliminate the suspect foods from your diet to assess any changes in your psoriasis. Alcohol binges are associated with worsening psoriasis. If you tend to smoke when you drink, you might be dealing yourself a double whammy. Evidence indicates that people who smoke tobacco products may be more likely to develop a form of psoriasis that causes pustules to develop on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Researchers have also found a correlation between smoking and more serious forms of psoriasis. If you suffer from psoriasis, an infection by bacteria and viruses can cause symptoms to flare. A strep infection, specifically, is a known trigger for guttate psoriasis, a form of the disease that causes red, droplet-shaped lesions to develop on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs. Although researchers don't know the exact cause of psoriasis, the immune system seems to play a key role in its development. Germs, illness, viruses or bacteria -- anything that temporarily revs up your immune system -- may cause your symptoms to worsen. Even something as simple as a common cold or respiratory virus may trigger a psoriasis flare. Strive to keep yourself healthy by eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, getting enough rest and keeping stress levels under control. Since getting the flu may temporarily alter your immune system and could worsen your psoriasis, you're wise to think about getting immunized against the flu. There should be no problem getting a flu shot during an active psoriasis flare -- just make sure the flu vaccine you receive does not contain any live virus. Due to a risk of complication from some vaccinations for people with psoriasis, always check with a health care provider before getting your flu vaccine. Wool sweaters are synonymous with winter for some people with psoriasis, but the itchiness of the fabric may make your already irritated skin feel worse. Consider dressing in layers made from natural plant fibers, such as cotton, to keep you warm and comfortable. If you suffer from scalp psoriasis and find that flaking is a problem, choose lighter-colored clothes to hide dandruff. Stress is a known psoriasis trigger, and some people find the holidays very stressful. Try to counter the stress with relaxation techniques to keep yourself calm. You might try yoga, meditation, biofeedback, or even a long walk. Holidays are also a time of heavy drinking, which could possibly worsen psoriasis symptoms. And then, of course, there are the many social gatherings indoors with people who may have colds or other viruses, which could worsen your lesions if you get sick. To make your holiday season an enjoyable one, make every attempt to enjoy the time spent with family and friends and follow as healthy a lifestyle as possible. It's the best present you can give to yourself.</p>",2025-11-25 03:29:33-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Don't despair. You don't need to tough it out until spring, counting the days until you get some relief from psoriasis. Here are answers to seven frequently asked questions about psoriasis in fall and winter. Dry air and low levels of exposure to sunlight's ultraviolet rays likely cause worsening psoriasis symptoms during fall and winter. Not only are the winter days shorter, but most people tend to spend less time outside. And, when they do brave the elements, they're usually bundled up from head to toe. UVB rays are most prevalent at noontime in the spring and summer. All of these things add up to much less ultraviolet light from the sun, which may ease psoriasis in spring and summer. Experts believe that ultraviolet light hinders the rapid growth of skin cells that is characteristic of psoriasis. So you may find that your psoriasis is more likely to flare and your plaques worsen when you spend less time in the sun. Also, the lack of humidity in the air outside and the dry heat in most buildings during the colder months can rob your skin of the moisture it needs. You may be able to alleviate dryness-related psoriasis symptoms by regularly moisturizing your skin and using a humidifier at home. If possible, humidify your office, too. Definitely don't go running off to the tanning booth -- there are safer ways to get your psoriasis-easing ultraviolet rays. The medical use of light rays to treat psoriasis is known as phototherapy. A variety of options exist, which can be done in a doctor's office, psoriasis clinic, or even the comfort of your home. The form of light known as ultraviolet light B ( UVB) seems to be the most beneficial for treating psoriasis. Your doctor may prescribe a certain amount of UVB exposure depending on your symptoms. If your doctor does choose this form of light therapy for your psoriasis, ask whether you should consider purchasing a home UVB unit. Other phototherapy options for psoriasis treatment include the use of ultraviolet light A ( UVA) in conjunction with special medications that respond to these light rays. This is rarely used, however, because it can cause skin cancer. Looking for a reason to take a getaway to some tropical locale? It could be just what the doctor ordered to ease your psoriasis symptoms. The beneficial effects of a sunny vacation in the middle of winter could help ease psoriasis symptoms for a few months. Alcohol and key foods probably will not trigger a psoriasis flare. Though medical researchers have yet to prove that certain foods cause psoriasis flares, many patients report that eating certain foods seems to worsen their psoriasis. This, though, may be a coincidence. If you notice a regular connection between eating certain foods and increased skin symptoms, ask your doctor whether you can safely eliminate the suspect foods from your diet to assess any changes in your psoriasis. Alcohol binges are associated with worsening psoriasis. If you tend to smoke when you drink, you might be dealing yourself a double whammy. Evidence indicates that people who smoke tobacco products may be more likely to develop a form of psoriasis that causes pustules to develop on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Researchers have also found a correlation between smoking and more serious forms of psoriasis. If you suffer from psoriasis, an infection by bacteria and viruses can cause symptoms to flare. A strep infection, specifically, is a known trigger for guttate psoriasis, a form of the disease that causes red, droplet-shaped lesions to develop on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs. Although researchers don't know the exact cause of psoriasis, the immune system seems to play a key role in its development. Germs, illness, viruses or bacteria -- anything that temporarily revs up your immune system -- may cause your symptoms to worsen. Even something as simple as a common cold or respiratory virus may trigger a psoriasis flare. Strive to keep yourself healthy by eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, getting enough rest and keeping stress levels under control. Since getting the flu may temporarily alter your immune system and could worsen your psoriasis, you're wise to think about getting immunized against the flu. There should be no problem getting a flu shot during an active psoriasis flare -- just make sure the flu vaccine you receive does not contain any live virus. Due to a risk of complication from some vaccinations for people with psoriasis, always check with a health care provider before getting your flu vaccine. Wool sweaters are synonymous with winter for some people with psoriasis, but the itchiness of the fabric may make your already irritated skin feel worse. Consider dressing in layers made from natural plant fibers, such as cotton, to keep you warm and comfortable. If you suffer from scalp psoriasis and find that flaking is a problem, choose lighter-colored clothes to hide dandruff. Stress is a known psoriasis trigger, and some people find the holidays very stressful. Try to counter the stress with relaxation techniques to keep yourself calm. You might try yoga, meditation, biofeedback, or even a long walk. Holidays are also a time of heavy drinking, which could possibly worsen psoriasis symptoms. And then, of course, there are the many social gatherings indoors with people who may have colds or other viruses, which could worsen your lesions if you get sick. To make your holiday season an enjoyable one, make every attempt to enjoy the time spent with family and friends and follow as healthy a lifestyle as possible. It's the best present you can give to yourself.</p>",2025-11-25 05:08:08-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Where can you find xylitol?,MASH,"""Xylitol is a carbohydrate found in the birch tree and several kinds of fruit.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Xylitol is a carbohydrate found in the birch tree and several kinds of fruit. It has a chemical structure that looks like a cross between a sugar and an alcohol, but it is neither. Xylitol is a sugar-free sweetener added to some foods. It's nearly as sweet as sugar (sucrose), but has fewer calories. People with diabetes sometimes use xylitol as a sugar substitute. Blood sugar levels stay at a more constant level with xylitol than with regular sugar. This is because it is absorbed more slowly by the body. Some types of gum or oral care products, such as toothpaste and mouthwash, also contain xylitol. Mouth bacteria can't use xylitol as a source of energy, so it may help prevent tooth decay and the buildup of plaque. Researchers have studied the use of xylitol to prevent sudden attacks of middle ear inflammation (otitis media) in children with frequent earaches. One way it may help is by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. More studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness for this and other uses. Optimal doses of xylitol have not been set for any condition. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely from maker to maker. This makes it difficult to set a standard dose. Xylitol is extracted from plant material. The amount naturally found in foods is very small. However, it is increasingly found as an ingredient (additiive) in more and more foods and health products. In addition to gum, xylitol can be found in some hard candies, chocolate, table syrup, jams, jellies, baked goods, cough syrup, vitamins, some nut butters, over-the-counter medications and many others. Xylitol is mostly safe, especially if taken in amounts found in food. The FDA has approved xylitol as a food additive or sweetener. Side effects. If you take large amounts of xylitol, such as 30 to 40 grams, you may experience diarrhea or gas. Increasing the dose gradually may help minimize these effects. Risks. There is not enough information to confirm xylitol's safety in pregnant and breastfeeding women, so they should not use it for medicinal purposes. Although some animal studies have shown tumor growth resulting from high doses of xylitol over long periods, more research is needed. If you are a dog owner, be aware that xylitol can be toxic to dogs, even in small amounts. Interactions. Doctors don't know of any interactions with other herbs, supplements, drugs, or foods.

Right now, there isn't anything you can change about your lifestyle to specifically keep you from getting one of these digestive problems that's written into your genes. Research into the complex relationship is ongoing, and there's a lot more still to be learned. Here's what we know so far. There's a strong link between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. IBD includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis ( UC). Crohn's can affect any part of the stomach and intestines; UC usually affects the lower parts of your GI tract, the colon and rectum. After looking at the gene patterns of tens of thousands of people with serious autoimmune diseases, scientists are finding that the same problem genes can be responsible for psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. These conditions trigger inflammation in similar ways, too. Your skin and intestines are organs made up of tissue that absorbs things more easily, so it's not surprising that both are sensitive and react to the inflammation signals that travel throughout your body. One study found that 1 in 10 women with psoriasis develop an IBD. ( The odds were even higher for those with psoriatic arthritis, another condition linked with psoriasis.) People with psoriasis are 2.5 times more likely to get Crohn's and 1.6 times more likely to get UC. Some people get a digestive disorder first and psoriasis later. IBD and psoriasis also share a connection with obesity. Fat tissue seems to make chemicals that change how the body works, including the immune system. Having a lot of extra weight raises your odds of having psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC. It can also make them get worse faster and make treatments less effective. When you have celiac disease, you can't digest gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease can damage your small intestine and prevent it from absorbing key nutrients. The chance of getting celiac disease is nearly 3 times higher among people with psoriasis. About 4 of every 100 have it. Research shows that the higher the levels of specific antibodies related to celiac disease, the worse psoriasis tends to be. Watch for signs of digestive issues, and tell your doctor so you can get tested and change your treatment plan, if needed. IBD ( Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) symptoms include: Diarrhea Belly cramps Blood in your poop Celiac disease or gluten sensitivity symptoms in adults may include: Diarrhea Bad-smelling poop Fatigue Feeling weak, dizzy, or short of breath Cold hands and feet Sore, achy joints You might mistake celiac disease for psoriatic arthritis, because both can cause joint pain and fatigue. Your doctor can order a blood test that measures levels of antibodies to check whether gluten affects you. It's often helpful to have a specialist called a gastroenterologist as well as a dermatologist on your health care team. You and your team can decide what treatment is right for you based on what and how severe your symptoms are and the medication side effects you're willing to deal with. The same drug may work for both your psoriasis and IBD. But some biologic medications are more likely than others to trigger a flare for someone who already has an IBD. Following a gluten-free diet has helped some people clear their psoriasis lesions as well as manage celiac. What's more, going gluten-free has helped people who test positive for a gluten sensitivity even when they don't have any celiac symptoms or signs of the disease.

How do you take care of a nebulizer?,MASH,"""Cleaning Cleaning and disinfecting your asthma nebulizer equipment is simple and very important. Proper care prevents infection. Cleaning should be done in a dust- and smoke-free area away from open windows. Follow these instructions when cleaning your nebulizer: After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess water, and let air dry. At the end of each day, the nebulizer cup, mask, or mouthpiece should be washed in warm soapy water using a mild detergent, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to air dry. You do not need to clean the compressor tubing. Every third day, after washing your equipment, disinfect the equipment using either a vinegar/water solution or the disinfectant solution your equipment supplier suggests. To use the vinegar solution, mix 1/2 cup white vinegar with 1 1/2 cups of water. Soak the equipment for 20 minutes and rinse well under a steady stream of water.

Nebulizers are particularly effective in delivering asthma medications to infants and small children and to anyone who has difficulty using an asthma inhaler. It is also convenient when a large dose of an inhaled medication is needed. Nebulized therapy is often called a 'breathing treatment.' And a variety of medications -- both for immediate relief and maintenance of asthma symptoms -- are available for use with a nebulizer. Nebulizers come in home (tabletop) and portable models. Home nebulizers are larger and must be plugged into an electrical outlet. Portable nebulizers run on batteries -- either disposable or rechargeable -- or can be plugged into a car's cigarette lighter. Smaller, portable units are slightly larger than a deck of cards, so they can be carried in a purse, briefcase, or backpack to be used whenever and wherever you need them. To obtain a nebulizer, you need a prescription from your doctor, or it can be dispensed from your pediatrician's office. ( Oftentimes, a breathing treatment is administered at the doctor's office.) Home nebulizers vary in cost, ranging from about $50 and up, plus the cost of accessories. Portable nebulizers usually cost a little more than home nebulizers. Both are usually covered under the durable medical equipment portion of health insurance policies. But, most insurance companies will require you to work with a specified durable medical equipment supplier. Check with your insurance company before purchasing or renting a nebulizer to ensure it will be covered. Your health care provider should be able to assist you with these arrangements. To use a nebulizer, you will need the following supplies: Air compressor Nebulizer cup Mask or mouthpiece Medication (either unit dose vials or bottles with measuring devices) Compressor tubing Once you have the necessary supplies: Place the air compressor on a sturdy surface that will support its weight. Plug the cord from the compressor into a properly grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet. Before asthma treatment, wash your hands with soap and water and dry completely. Carefully measure medications exactly as you have been instructed and put them into the nebulizer cup. Most medications today come in premeasured unit dose vials so measuring is not necessary. If you do measure, use a separate, clean measuring device for each medication. Assemble the nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece. Connect the tubing to both the aerosol compressor and nebulizer cup. Turn on the compressor to make sure it is working correctly. You should see a light mist coming from the back of the tube opposite the mouthpiece. Sit up straight on a comfortable chair. If the treatment is for your child, he or she may sit on your lap. If you are using a mask, position it comfortably and securely on your or your child's face. If you are using a mouthpiece, place it between your or your child's teeth and seal the lips around it. Take slow, deep breaths. If possible, hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before breathing out. This allows the medication to settle into the airways. Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (an average of 10 minutes). The nebulizer will make a sputtering noise, and the cup will have just a little medication remaining. If dizziness or jitteriness occurs, stop the treatment and rest for about 5 minutes. Continue the treatment, and try to breathe more slowly. If dizziness or jitteriness continues to be a problem with future treatments, inform your health care provider. During the treatment, if the medication sticks to the sides of the nebulizer cup, you may shake the cup to loosen the droplets. Your pediatrician should tell you the frequency of nebulizer use and how long you should use it. You should also be given an asthma action plan that explains which medications to use and when. Using a portable nebulizer is similar to using a home nebulizer, except that you don't need to plug it in. Most models are small enough to hold in your hand during use. Cleaning Cleaning and disinfecting your asthma nebulizer equipment is simple and very important. Proper care prevents infection. Cleaning should be done in a dust- and smoke-free area away from open windows. Follow these instructions when cleaning your nebulizer: After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess water, and let air dry. At the end of each day, the nebulizer cup, mask, or mouthpiece should be washed in warm soapy water using a mild detergent, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to air dry. You do not need to clean the compressor tubing. Every third day, after washing your equipment, disinfect the equipment using either a vinegar/water solution or the disinfectant solution your equipment supplier suggests. To use the vinegar solution, mix 1/2 cup white vinegar with 1 1/2 cups of water. Soak the equipment for 20 minutes and rinse well under a steady stream of water. Shake off the excess water and allow to air dry on a paper towel. Always allow the equipment to completely dry before storing in a plastic, zippered bag. Storing Cover the compressor with a clean cloth when not in use. Keep it clean by wiping it with a clean, damp cloth as needed. Do not put the air compressor on the floor either for treatments or for storage. Medications should be stored in a cool, dry place. Some medications require refrigeration and some require protection from light. Check them often. If they have changed color or formed crystals, throw them away and replace them with new ones. Other Tips Always have an extra nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece in case you need it. If you are given a nebulizer treatment in the doctor's office, be sure to ask for the tubing, cup, and mask. Check the air compressor's filter as directed. Replace or clean according to the directions from your equipment supplier.</p>",2025-11-25 02:44:33-08:00,False,Response is valid.

They produce harmful venom that may cause a painful sore at the site of the bite. It may cause even more severe symptoms in some people. If you have a run-in with a brown recluse, it's wise to have a doctor check you out, just in case. A brown recluse might not be brown, but tan. It has a violin-shaped area on the front half of its body, with the neck of the violin pointing toward the spider's abdomen. It may be bigger than other spiders that you're used to seeing. Its body can range in size from a quarter-inch to three-quarters of an inch, and its long legs make it appear even larger. Most spiders have eight eyes, but a brown recluse spider has six. Two are in the front, and there are two more on each side of its head. Brown recluses are found mostly in the Midwest or the South. The spider favors indoor spaces, like attics, garages or dark closets. Outdoors, it hides in out-of-the-way places -- under logs, beneath porches, or within piles of rocks. A bite might not hurt at first or even leave a mark. For some people, it feels like a pinch or a bee sting. Within the first day or two after you've been bitten, you may notice: Pain or redness at the site of the bite A deep sore (ulcer) that forms where you were bitten, with the skin at the center turning purple Fever Chills Nausea Joint pain Feeling weak Seizures or coma (very rare) Your doctor will want to be as certain as he can that you were, in fact, bitten by a spider. It'll help if you can describe what the spider looked like. Some people try to catch the bug to show the doctor. That's fine, as long as you can do it safely. You might just try to take a photo of it. If you suspect your small child was bitten by a brown recluse, see your doctor right away. Their bodies can't ward off the dangerous effects of the spider's venom. For adults, most brown recluse spider bites can be treated at home with good results. But about 10% of them cause ulcers or blisters that damage your skin so badly that you need a doctor's care. If your symptoms are mild, try these simple home remedies: Clean it with soap and water.

The spider favors indoor spaces, like attics, garages or dark closets. Outdoors, it hides in out-of-the-way places -- under logs, beneath porches, or within piles of rocks. A bite might not hurt at first or even leave a mark. For some people, it feels like a pinch or a bee sting. Within the first day or two after you've been bitten, you may notice: Pain or redness at the site of the bite A deep sore (ulcer) that forms where you were bitten, with the skin at the center turning purple Fever Chills Nausea Joint pain Feeling weak Seizures or coma (very rare) Your doctor will want to be as certain as he can that you were, in fact, bitten by a spider. It'll help if you can describe what the spider looked like. Some people try to catch the bug to show the doctor. That's fine, as long as you can do it safely. You might just try to take a photo of it. If you suspect your small child was bitten by a brown recluse, see your doctor right away. Their bodies can't ward off the dangerous effects of the spider's venom. For adults, most brown recluse spider bites can be treated at home with good results. But about 10% of them cause ulcers or blisters that damage your skin so badly that you need a doctor's care. If your symptoms are mild, try these simple home remedies: Clean it with soap and water. Apply antibiotic cream. If you were bitten on an arm or leg, keep it raised while you're resting. This can reduce swelling. Put ice on it. Take over-the-counter pain medicine. Watch for more severe symptoms. See a doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms: The bite has formed an ulcer or blister with a dark (blue, purple or black) center. You're in extreme pain. You have an infection at the site of the bite. You're having trouble breathing.

They tend to live in indoor and outdoor spaces where people don't go most of the time. If you do find yourself in the same place as one, though, it won't want to attack you -- it'll want to get out of your way. But if it feels trapped, it may bite you. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Brown recluse spiders are one of two spiders found in the United States that can cause real trouble if they bite you. They produce harmful venom that may cause a painful sore at the site of the bite. It may cause even more severe symptoms in some people. If you have a run-in with a brown recluse, it's wise to have a doctor check you out, just in case. A brown recluse might not be brown, but tan. It has a violin-shaped area on the front half of its body, with the neck of the violin pointing toward the spider's abdomen. It may be bigger than other spiders that you're used to seeing.

So what's going on if it seems to you like your panic attack just won't end? To figure out the possible reasons it feels this way, it helps to understand what's happening during a panic attack. When you have one, it triggers your 'fight or flight' response, which is how your body reacts when your physical safety is threatened. You get a rush of adrenaline that amps you up so you can make a split-second decision to run or fight. This response isn't meant to last very long and soon burns itself out. That's why panic attacks that last as long as an hour aren't very common. What's the story with a panic attack that seems to go and on? If that's happening to you, it's likely one of three things: Waves of panic attacks Aftereffects of a single panic attack Another health condition If you have panic attack symptoms for an hour or more, you may really be having a wave of panic attacks, one after another.

The fight or flight response is so draining, it's hard to set it off that often. A more likely possibility is that you had a single panic attack that leaves you feeling generally anxious, tired, and frayed. While panic attacks can be scary, they're not dangerous. But the fear they may cause you can be more unsettling than the attack itself. That's especially true if you've never had one before.

How can I eat and drink properly for stronger bones?,MASH,"""Get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet to keep bones healthy. Enjoy low-fat dairy products or dark, leafy green veggies to get calcium from natural sources. Get vitamin D in egg yolks, ocean fish, and liver. You may need calcium or vitamin D supplements"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> When you have rheumatoid arthritis ( RA), you expect painful or stiff joints. But did you know RA also can make your bones weaker and more likely to break? That's because RA raises your risk of getting osteoporosis, a condition that makes your bones porous or not as dense and strong as they should be to hold up your weight. When this happens, even a minor slip or tumble can cause a painful crack or fracture. The bones most likely to break are in your hips, spine, and wrists. Osteoporosis is very common, especially as you age. People at higher risk include women, particularly after menopause; people with thin frames; smokers; and people who don't get enough calcium or aren't active. There are reasons RA makes you more likely to get osteoporosis: Inflammation : When you have RA, you have inflammation all over your body, especially in your joints. They can swell and break down. That can weaken your bones around the joints affected by RA, like the joints in your hands. Our bodies are always making new bone to replace bone that breaks down. But RA inflammation breaks this cycle. It speeds up your bone loss and slows the making of new bone to replace it. Your bones get weaker, and that leads to osteoporosis. Inflammation also may make it harder for your body to absorb nutrients it needs to keep your bones strong, like calcium or vitamin D. Pain makes you inactive: RA can make you feel stiff, achy, or so tired that you don't feel like getting off the couch. Physical activity, like walking, helps keep your bones strong. If you don't exercise, your bones can get weaker over time. If RA keeps you from being active, you're at higher risk for osteoporosis. Steroid drugs: Corticosteroid drugs like prednisone ( Deltasone) can weaken your bones if you take them for a long time. Some people with RA need to take these medications to help with bad flares of inflammation. The drugs can quickly ease pain and swelling so you can get moving again. But they can make it harder for your body to absorb calcium and vitamin D in your diet. These nutrients help you build strong bones. Your osteoporosis risk is even higher if you're a woman past menopause and have taken steroids for 6 months or more. If you have RA, you can do things to help protect your bones: Get inflammation under control. RA drugs like methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) inhibitors, such as adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab ( Remicade), or infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade, can stop inflammation and reduce your risk of a fracture. TNF inhibitors may even protect you from this damage. Eat and drink for stronger bones. Get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet to keep bones healthy. Enjoy low-fat dairy products or dark, leafy green veggies to get calcium from natural sources. Get vitamin D in egg yolks, ocean fish, and liver. You may need calcium or vitamin D supplements. Stay active. Exercise helps you develop flexible joints, stronger muscles, and better balance with RA. It also can help you protect your bones from osteoporosis because it builds bone mass. The best activities for this are walking, dancing, climbing, or strength training. Even light exercise, like a short walk, can make your joints feel looser and keep your bones strong. Don't smoke or drink too much. Smoking raises your risk of osteoporosis. It also can cause women to go through menopause and start losing bone mass earlier in life. So if you smoke, quit now. Drinking too much also can make you more likely to lose bone or even to slip and fall. Get bone tests. See your doctor regularly to test for signs of osteoporosis. Some people don't know they have it until they have a painful fracture. A bone-density test can tell you if your bones are starting to weaken (osteopenia). This test uses X-rays to see how much calcium and other bone minerals are in your bones. Your spine, hips, and forearms are the most common areas tested. If you take certain drugs for RA, like steroids, this test can show bone problems early so you can make changes to keep it from getting worse. Ask your doctor about bone-preserving drugs. Medications called bisphosphonates can help stop your bones from breaking down. These include zoledronate ( Reclast) and denosumab ( Prolia, Xgeva). You'll need to take these for a long time, so talk to your doctor to see if they're right for you. Avoid accidents. If you have RA and are at risk for osteoporosis, take extra care not to slip or fall. Physical and occupational therapists can show you safer ways to do daily tasks and how to safely exercise. Yoga, tai chi, or low-impact aerobics may help you stay fit and improve your balance.</p>",2025-11-25 03:18:03-08:00,False,Response is valid.

But did you know RA also can make your bones weaker and more likely to break? That's because RA raises your risk of getting osteoporosis, a condition that makes your bones porous or not as dense and strong as they should be to hold up your weight. When this happens, even a minor slip or tumble can cause a painful crack or fracture. The bones most likely to break are in your hips, spine, and wrists. Osteoporosis is very common, especially as you age. People at higher risk include women, particularly after menopause; people with thin frames; smokers; and people who don't get enough calcium or aren't active. There are reasons RA makes you more likely to get osteoporosis: Inflammation : When you have RA, you have inflammation all over your body, especially in your joints. They can swell and break down. That can weaken your bones around the joints affected by RA, like the joints in your hands. Our bodies are always making new bone to replace bone that breaks down. But RA inflammation breaks this cycle. It speeds up your bone loss and slows the making of new bone to replace it. Your bones get weaker, and that leads to osteoporosis. Inflammation also may make it harder for your body to absorb nutrients it needs to keep your bones strong, like calcium or vitamin D. Pain makes you inactive: RA can make you feel stiff, achy, or so tired that you don't feel like getting off the couch. Physical activity, like walking, helps keep your bones strong. If you don't exercise, your bones can get weaker over time. If RA keeps you from being active, you're at higher risk for osteoporosis. Steroid drugs: Corticosteroid drugs like prednisone ( Deltasone) can weaken your bones if you take them for a long time. Some people with RA need to take these medications to help with bad flares of inflammation. The drugs can quickly ease pain and swelling so you can get moving again. But they can make it harder for your body to absorb calcium and vitamin D in your diet. These nutrients help you build strong bones. Your osteoporosis risk is even higher if you're a woman past menopause and have taken steroids for 6 months or more. If you have RA, you can do things to help protect your bones: Get inflammation under control. RA drugs like methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) inhibitors, such as adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab ( Remicade), or infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade, can stop inflammation and reduce your risk of a fracture. TNF inhibitors may even protect you from this damage. Eat and drink for stronger bones. Get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet to keep bones healthy. Enjoy low-fat dairy products or dark, leafy green veggies to get calcium from natural sources. Get vitamin D in egg yolks, ocean fish, and liver. You may need calcium or vitamin D supplements. Stay active. Exercise helps you develop flexible joints, stronger muscles, and better balance with RA. It also can help you protect your bones from osteoporosis because it builds bone mass. The best activities for this are walking, dancing, climbing, or strength training. Even light exercise, like a short walk, can make your joints feel looser and keep your bones strong. Don't smoke or drink too much. Smoking raises your risk of osteoporosis. It also can cause women to go through menopause and start losing bone mass earlier in life. So if you smoke, quit now. Drinking too much also can make you more likely to lose bone or even to slip and fall. Get bone tests. See your doctor regularly to test for signs of osteoporosis. Some people don't know they have it until they have a painful fracture. A bone-density test can tell you if your bones are starting to weaken (osteopenia). This test uses X-rays to see how much calcium and other bone minerals are in your bones. Your spine, hips, and forearms are the most common areas tested. If you take certain drugs for RA, like steroids, this test can show bone problems early so you can make changes to keep it from getting worse. Ask your doctor about bone-preserving drugs. Medications called bisphosphonates can help stop your bones from breaking down. These include zoledronate ( Reclast) and denosumab ( Prolia, Xgeva). You'll need to take these for a long time, so talk to your doctor to see if they're right for you. Avoid accidents. If you have RA and are at risk for osteoporosis, take extra care not to slip or fall. Physical and occupational therapists can show you safer ways to do daily tasks and how to safely exercise. Yoga, tai chi, or low-impact aerobics may help you stay fit and improve your balance.</p>",2025-11-25 05:16:51-08:00,False,Response is valid.
Does what you eat and drink cause acne?,MASH,"""Most experts agree that certain foods, like chocolate, don't cause pimples. Still, it makes sense to avoid greasy food and junk food and add more fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains to your diet. Dairy products and foods high in processed sugar may trigger acne"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } 1. Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface. Washing more often than twice daily is not necessarily better; it may do more harm than good. Use warm, not hot, water and a mild facial cleanser. Using a harsh soap (like deodorant body soap) can hurt already inflamed skin and cause more irritation. Avoid scrubbing your skin harshly with a washcloth, an exfoliating glove, or loofah (a coarse-textured sponge). Gently wash it with a very soft cloth or your hands. Always rinse well, and then dry your face with a clean towel. ( Toss the towel in the laundry hamper, as dirty towels spread bacteria.) Also, use the washcloth only once. 2. Moisturize. Many acne products contain ingredients that dry the skin, so always use a moisturizer that minimizes dryness and skin peeling. Look for 'noncomedogenic' on the label, which means it should not cause acne. There are moisturizers made for oily, dry, or combination skin. 3. Try an over-the-counter acne product. These acne products don't need a prescription. Most of them have ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid, which curb bacteria and dry your skin. They may cause drying or peeling so start with a small amount at first. Then you can adjust how much you use and how often. Another option is a new OTC topical retinoid gel ( Differin 0.1% gel). It works to actually keep the acne from forming. Use these products with caution if you have sensitive skin. 4. Use makeup sparingly. During a breakout, avoid wearing foundation, powder, or blush. If you do wear makeup, wash it off at the end of the day. If possible, choose oil-free cosmetics without added dyes and chemicals. Choose makeup that is labeled as 'noncomedogenic,' meaning it should not cause acne. Read the ingredients list on the product label before buying. 5. Watch what you put on your hair. Avoid using fragrances, oils, pomades, or gels on your hair. If they get on your face, they can block your skin's pores and irritate your skin. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Oily hair can add to the oil on your face, so wash your hair often, especially if you're breaking out. Got long hair? Keep it pulled away from your face. 6. Keep your hands off your face. Avoid touching your face or propping your cheek or chin on your hands. Not only can you spread bacteria, you can also irritate the already inflamed facial skin. Never pick or pop pimples with your fingers, as it can lead to infection and scarring. 7. Stay out of the sun. The sun's ultraviolet rays can increase inflammation and redness, and can cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark discoloration). Some acne medications may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Limit your time in the sun, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and wear protective clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and a broad-brimmed hat. Whether you have pimples or not, always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with 6% zinc oxide or higher and SPF 30 or higher at least 20 minutes before sun exposure. Look for 'noncomedogenic' on the sunscreen label to make new pimples less likely. Read the ingredients on the product label to know what you're putting on your skin. 8. Feed your skin. Most experts agree that certain foods, like chocolate, don't cause pimples. Still, it makes sense to avoid greasy food and junk food and add more fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains to your diet. Dairy products and foods high in processed sugar may trigger acne. Avoid these. 9. Exercise daily. Regular exercise is good for your whole body, including your skin. When you exercise, avoid wearing clothing or using exercise equipment that rubs your skin and may cause irritation. Shower or bathe right after exercise. 10. Chill! Some studies link stress with the severity of pimples or acne. Ask yourself what's making you feel stressed. Then look for solutions. When in doubt, check with a dermatologist to see if you need more treatment to prevent or stop acne.</p>",2025-11-25 01:49:25-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Can you fix thinning hair?,MASH,"""Yes. With some treatments, you can slow down or stop hair thinning -- and maybe even grow back some hair you thought was gone forever.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> So you're never going to have a thick, lush head of hair again. But at least you'd like to hang on to what you've got. Short of a transplant, is there anything you can do to stop thinning hair? Yes. With some treatments, you can slow down or stop hair thinning -- and maybe even grow back some hair you thought was gone forever. Read on to see what works and what doesn't. This is the only over-the-counter medication for hair loss approved by the FDA for use by both men and women. It won't rescue a receding hairline. It does stimulate hair growth, although scientists aren't quite sure how it works. Minoxidil is available as Rogaine or Theroxidil, or in generic form. It's sold as a liquid or foam and in two strengths: 2% and 5%. Effectiveness: Minoxidil works for about 2 out of 3 men. It's most effective if you're under age 40 and have only recently started to lose your hair. How to use it: Twice a day, when your hair is dry, apply minoxidil on your scalp where the hair has started to thin. Then be patient. You may not notice changes for 4 months or more. What it doesn't do: Minoxidil does not cure baldness. If you stop using it, you will start losing hair again. Your hair may fall out faster than before. Side effects: You may have redness, itching, dryness, flaking, or other scalp irritation, though this is uncommon. It's more likely if you use the stronger 5% solution. This medication stops your body from making the hormone at the root of male pattern baldness, DHT (dihydrotestosterone). It is available under the brand name Propecia. Effectiveness: Finasteride is very effective. It slows or stops hair loss in nearly 90% of men. About two-thirds of these men also regrow some hair. How to use it: Finasteride is a pill. Usually, you take it once a day. Your dermatologist may recommend using it in combination with minoxidil. What it doesn't do: Like minoxidil, it doesn't cure hair loss. If you stop taking it, you will lose hair again. Side effects: Finasteride can cause erectile dysfunction and other sexual side effects, though this is unusual. If it happens to you, it will likely clear up once you stop taking finasteride. But for some men, that can take 3 months or more. Biotin is a B vitamin that is essential for your health. You most likely get plenty of it in your diet in egg yolks, yeast, liver, and other foods. That's good news because too little biotin can cause hair loss. Does that mean that taking mega-doses of it will give you more hair? Probably not. No scientific studies have shown biotin to prevent or treat hair loss. You may have heard that laser combs, brushes, hoods, and caps can help halt hair loss. The theory is that when hair follicles absorb laser light at a certain level, it stimulates hair to grow. But there's not enough evidence that any of these devices restore hair or prevent balding. If you lose hair suddenly, see your doctor. It may be caused by illnesses, medicine, or low levels of iron or vitamin D.</p>",2025-11-25 03:28:17-08:00,False,Response is valid.
Can you fix thinning hair?,MASH,"""With some treatments, you can slow down or stop hair thinning -- and maybe even grow back some hair you thought was gone forever.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> So you're never going to have a thick, lush head of hair again. But at least you'd like to hang on to what you've got. Short of a transplant, is there anything you can do to stop thinning hair? Yes. With some treatments, you can slow down or stop hair thinning -- and maybe even grow back some hair you thought was gone forever. Read on to see what works and what doesn't. This is the only over-the-counter medication for hair loss approved by the FDA for use by both men and women. It won't rescue a receding hairline. It does stimulate hair growth, although scientists aren't quite sure how it works. Minoxidil is available as Rogaine or Theroxidil, or in generic form. It's sold as a liquid or foam and in two strengths: 2% and 5%. Effectiveness: Minoxidil works for about 2 out of 3 men. It's most effective if you're under age 40 and have only recently started to lose your hair. How to use it: Twice a day, when your hair is dry, apply minoxidil on your scalp where the hair has started to thin. Then be patient. You may not notice changes for 4 months or more. What it doesn't do: Minoxidil does not cure baldness. If you stop using it, you will start losing hair again. Your hair may fall out faster than before. Side effects: You may have redness, itching, dryness, flaking, or other scalp irritation, though this is uncommon. It's more likely if you use the stronger 5% solution.

Your child may be constipated if he's having any of these symptoms: Abdominal pain Fewer than three bowel movements per week for children, and for babies, no bowel movement for 2 or 3 days more than usual Your child attempts to hold in his stool -- signs include making faces, crossing his legs, or twisting his body. Hard, dry stools that don't pass easily Stains and small stool marks in your child's underwear There are many things that can cause your child to become constipated. Some of the most common are: Withholding. Your child may ignore the urge to have a bowel movement because he's too busy playing to stop and go, or may not be comfortable using a public restroom. He may fear a painful bowel movement or have issues with potty training. Low dietary fiber. Fiber keeps the bowels moving, but many kids don't eat enough fruits, vegetables and grains. Not enough fluids. Water and other liquids help fiber do its job. Medications. Certain medicines, including pain medicines and antacids, can cause constipation in kids. There are several remedies you can try at home to manage your child's constipation: Make sure your child is getting enough fluids. Most kids need about 3 to 4 glasses of water every day. Add more fiber into your child's diet. Make sure she's eating enough fruits, grains and vegetables. Fiber keeps things moving. Make sure your child isn't overdoing fast food and junk food.

Should you avoid taking certain drugs while taking beta-blockers?,MASH,"""It's important that your doctor be aware of all the medications you are taking, as some may interact with beta-blockers. Talk to your doctor before taking any new drug, including over-the-counter drugs, herbs, and supplements"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Drugs called beta-blockers perform four main tasks essential for people with heart failure: Improve your heart's ability to relax Decrease the production of harmful substances your body makes in response to heart failure Slow your heart rate Improve the heart's pumping ability over time If you have heart failure, you need beta-blockers -- even if you do not have symptoms. Beta-blockers are prescribed for patients with systolic heart failure and improve survival, even in people with severe symptoms. There are several types of beta-blockers, but only three are approved by the FDA to treat heart failure: Bisoprolol ( Zebeta) Carvedilol ( Coreg) Metoprolol ( Toprol) They may be taken with meals, at bedtime, or in the morning. Food delays how your body absorbs beta-blockers, but they also may reduce side effects. Follow the directions on the label. Beta-blockers shouldn't be used if you have very low blood pressure (hypotension) or a slow pulse (bradycardia) that may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded. If you have severe lung congestion, your doctor will treat your congestion before prescribing a beta-blocker. While you are taking this beta-blocker, your doctor may tell you to take and record your pulse daily. He'll tell you how rapid your pulse should be.

Do I need disability benefits for ADHD?,MASH,"""Some people who are more severely affected can lose their job, wind up bouncing from job to job, or need to seek disability benefits"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Excellent focus, attention to detail, speed, and organization -- they are all things employers are looking for in employees and job candidates. But when you have ADHD, these and more can be a real challenge. It can make it tough to excel at work and sometimes even keep a job. You may feel restless or not be able to focus -- classic parts of having the disorder. But there are things you can do to help you get a job and thrive despite your ADHD. Sometimes it can be an asset. An estimated 8 million to 9 million American adults have ADHD. And many other people in similar situations struggle on the job. One national survey showed that only half of adults with ADHD were able to hold down a full-time job, compared to 72% of adults without the disorder. When they were able to secure a job, they tended to earn less than their peers without it. Those job problems translate into nearly $77 billion in lost income each year. How much ADHD affects your job outlook depends on how severe your condition is. Some people may just have trouble staying on task, while others can't make it through the workday without getting into a huge blow-up with a boss or co-worker. Some people who are more severely affected can lose their job, wind up bouncing from job to job, or need to seek disability benefits. ADHD affects job performance in a number of ways. If you can't sit still and have trouble with organization and focus, you may find meetings excruciating. Keeping track of multiple projects and deadlines is enormously challenging. One study showed that people with ADHD often had more trouble with attention, working memory, mental processing, and verbal fluency. These are all called executive-function abilities that are important in the workplace. If you have ADHD, it may be hard to: Manage time Get and stay organized Listen and pay attention Follow directions Complete assignments Attend to details Get to work on time Speak just when it's your turn Sit still Keep emotions under control You may also have trouble with: Anger Procrastination ADHD often leads to depression and low self-esteem. When you can't make deadlines and aren't able to complete your work on schedule, it can make these feelings worse. Many adults who are restless, aren't able to concentrate, or have other symptoms have never been formally diagnosed with ADHD. If you have any of the problems listed above, the first step should be to see a doctor who specializes in the treatment of adult ADHD. They can talk to you to see if you do have it. And if you do, diagnose you so that you can get started on the right treatment plan. People have success with medication, therapy, or both. There are also organizational strategies you can learn from a coach or occupational therapist and then practice. If you are about to start a job search, work with a career counselor to find a job that best matches your interests, needs, and abilities. That might want to find a more fast-paced job with flexible hours and a less-rigid structure. Or you may want to start your own business so that you can design your own work environment and hours. Once you have a job, try these: Find peace. Ask to work in a quiet space where you won't be easily distracted. Buddy up. Work with a manager or colleague who is well-organized and can help guide you through projects from start to completion. Book it. Keep a day planner with a calendar and list of things to do. Update them often. Set up your PDA or computer to send you electronic reminders for meetings and due dates. Write it down. Take notes at meetings and during phone conversations, and add all new tasks to your to-do list. Schedule interruptions. Set aside specific periods of time each day for answering voice mail and email so that they won't interrupt your other responsibilities. Set realistic goals. Break up your days into a series of individual assignments, and only try to tackle one task at a time. Use a timer to let you know when to move on to the next task. Reward yourself. When you complete an assignment or follow through on these organizational tricks, find a way to reward yourself. Take a break to go for a walk. Read a magazine article. For big goals, go out for a special lunch or get yourself something you've been wanting. Delegate. If you can, get an assistant or intern to take care of the small details to free you up so you can focus on the big picture. Relax, and make it a habit. Practice relaxation techniques. They can help with concentration. Try mediation or deep breathing. Get up once an hour and take a walk, get a drink of water, or talk to a co-worker. To help you adjust to your job, enlist the help of a career counselor or executive coach. He or she can offer you guidance on any issues you encounter. They can also help you work through the job situations that you find most troublesome. For example, they could help you role play how to discuss a pay raise with your boss without the conversation becoming emotionally charged. Because ADHD is considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, if you work at a larger company, they can't discriminate against you on the basis of your condition. The act also requires your company to accommodate your needs. But you have to be comfortable enough to let your employer know that you have ADHD. It may be best to research this topic more before bringing it up so you have a plan. Finally, take advantage of the benefits -- yes, there are benefits -- that can come with ADHD. The restlessness, impulsiveness, and constant desire to try new things can be great assets. This is especially true if you have your own business.

Do I need disability benefits for ADHD?,MASH,"""Finally, take advantage of the benefits -- yes, there are benefits -- that can come with ADHD.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Excellent focus, attention to detail, speed, and organization -- they are all things employers are looking for in employees and job candidates. But when you have ADHD, these and more can be a real challenge. It can make it tough to excel at work and sometimes even keep a job. You may feel restless or not be able to focus -- classic parts of having the disorder. But there are things you can do to help you get a job and thrive despite your ADHD. Sometimes it can be an asset. An estimated 8 million to 9 million American adults have ADHD. And many other people in similar situations struggle on the job. One national survey showed that only half of adults with ADHD were able to hold down a full-time job, compared to 72% of adults without the disorder. When they were able to secure a job, they tended to earn less than their peers without it. Those job problems translate into nearly $77 billion in lost income each year. How much ADHD affects your job outlook depends on how severe your condition is. Some people may just have trouble staying on task, while others can't make it through the workday without getting into a huge blow-up with a boss or co-worker. Some people who are more severely affected can lose their job, wind up bouncing from job to job, or need to seek disability benefits. ADHD affects job performance in a number of ways. If you can't sit still and have trouble with organization and focus, you may find meetings excruciating. Keeping track of multiple projects and deadlines is enormously challenging. One study showed that people with ADHD often had more trouble with attention, working memory, mental processing, and verbal fluency. These are all called executive-function abilities that are important in the workplace. If you have ADHD, it may be hard to: Manage time Get and stay organized Listen and pay attention Follow directions Complete assignments Attend to details Get to work on time Speak just when it's your turn Sit still Keep emotions under control You may also have trouble with: Anger Procrastination ADHD often leads to depression and low self-esteem. When you can't make deadlines and aren't able to complete your work on schedule, it can make these feelings worse. Many adults who are restless, aren't able to concentrate, or have other symptoms have never been formally diagnosed with ADHD. If you have any of the problems listed above, the first step should be to see a doctor who specializes in the treatment of adult ADHD. They can talk to you to see if you do have it. And if you do, diagnose you so that you can get started on the right treatment plan. People have success with medication, therapy, or both. There are also organizational strategies you can learn from a coach or occupational therapist and then practice. If you are about to start a job search, work with a career counselor to find a job that best matches your interests, needs, and abilities. That might want to find a more fast-paced job with flexible hours and a less-rigid structure. Or you may want to start your own business so that you can design your own work environment and hours. Once you have a job, try these: Find peace. Ask to work in a quiet space where you won't be easily distracted. Buddy up. Work with a manager or colleague who is well-organized and can help guide you through projects from start to completion. Book it. Keep a day planner with a calendar and list of things to do. Update them often. Set up your PDA or computer to send you electronic reminders for meetings and due dates. Write it down. Take notes at meetings and during phone conversations, and add all new tasks to your to-do list. Schedule interruptions. Set aside specific periods of time each day for answering voice mail and email so that they won't interrupt your other responsibilities. Set realistic goals. Break up your days into a series of individual assignments, and only try to tackle one task at a time. Use a timer to let you know when to move on to the next task. Reward yourself. When you complete an assignment or follow through on these organizational tricks, find a way to reward yourself. Take a break to go for a walk. Read a magazine article. For big goals, go out for a special lunch or get yourself something you've been wanting. Delegate. If you can, get an assistant or intern to take care of the small details to free you up so you can focus on the big picture. Relax, and make it a habit. Practice relaxation techniques. They can help with concentration. Try mediation or deep breathing. Get up once an hour and take a walk, get a drink of water, or talk to a co-worker. To help you adjust to your job, enlist the help of a career counselor or executive coach. He or she can offer you guidance on any issues you encounter. They can also help you work through the job situations that you find most troublesome. For example, they could help you role play how to discuss a pay raise with your boss without the conversation becoming emotionally charged. Because ADHD is considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, if you work at a larger company, they can't discriminate against you on the basis of your condition. The act also requires your company to accommodate your needs. But you have to be comfortable enough to let your employer know that you have ADHD.

When your body has too much of it, the excess hormone can throw off your body's other systems. Most cases of Cushing's syndrome can be cured, though it may take some time for your symptoms to ease up. The condition, also known as hypercortisolism, is more common in women than men. It's most often seen in people ages 25 to 40. You can get Cushing's syndrome when there's too much cortisol in your body for too long. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys. The most common cause is related to medications called glucocorticoids, also commonly known as steroids or prednisone. These prescription steroids are used for conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or after an organ transplant. They are powerful anti-inflammatory medications. Taking too much, for too long, can lead to Cushing's syndrome. A tumor in your pituitary gland, found at the base of the brain, or a tumor in the adrenal glands, can also prompt your body to make too much cortisol, which can lead to Cushing's. It's not usually a condition that's passed in families. In some rare cases, though, people develop it because a problem in their genes makes them more likely to get tumors on their glands. Your case might be different than someone else's, but when the disease is full-blown, common symptoms are: Rounded, rosy face Weight gain, especially upper body A fat pad in the upper back or base of the neck (you may hear this called a 'buffalo hump') Thinning skin that is easy to bruise Acne Being very tired Weak muscles, especially when using your shoulders and hip muscles High blood pressure High blood sugar levels Depression and anxiety Osteoporosis Kidney stones Sleep problems Extra hair growth on your body and face Irregular periods Low sex drive and problems having an erection Your skin could become thin, heal slowly, and bruise easily. You might get purple or pink stretch marks all over your body, especially your belly, thighs, arms, and chest. Your bones may get weak. Everyday movements like bending, lifting, or even getting out of a chair can cause backaches or breaks in your ribs or spine. Children with Cushing's syndrome are usually very heavy, what doctors call obese, and tend to grow slowly. It might take several appointments to settle on your diagnosis. When you go to your doctor, she'll do a physical exam and ask you questions. What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Are you feeling more emotional? What medications are you taking? Your doctor will probably also recommend some of these tests to help screen for Cushing's syndrome if she suspects you have it: 24-hour urinary free cortisol test. This common test collects your urine for 24 hours to measure how much cortisol is in it. Dexamethasone suppression test . You'll take a low-dose steroid pill at 11:00 p.m. and then take a blood test in the morning to see how much cortisol your body still makes. Late-night salivary cortisol level. This test measures cortisol in your saliva. As the name suggests, these tests happen at night. If you have Cushing's syndrome, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who will do other blood tests or imaging scans to find out what's causing it. Will my symptoms change? If so, how? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? How will we know if they're working? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? When will I start to feel better? Does this condition put me at risk for any others? The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. That will lead to how to treat your condition. For instance, if you have too much cortisol because you're taking steroid medicines, your doctor will check to see if you can stop taking the drugs, or take a lower dose. If a tumor is causing your Cushing's syndrome, you'll likely have other tests to determine the location of the tumor first before deciding on your treatment. Surgery to remove the tumor may be best. If not, your doctor may be able to shrink the tumor with radiation or medicine. Eating well is an important part of living with Cushing's. A healthy diet can ease some symptoms and prevent others. Protect your bones by eating foods with calcium and vitamin D. Limit how much sodium and fatty foods you eat. A nutritionist can help you make sure you're getting enough of the right nutrients. Let your family and friends know what you're going through. Ask for their support, and let them know how they can help. Take time for the people and activities you enjoy. It's OK to say no and set limits, so you keep your energy up. If you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to a counselor or therapist. Your doctor may be able to give you a referral. Your symptoms and how long they'll last depend on: The amount of extra cortisol you have The cause of your high cortisol How long you've had the condition Your overall health Most of the time Cushing's syndrome can be treated and cured. If your Cushing's syndrome isn't curable, you'll want to look for ways to manage your weight gain, muscle weakness, and tiredness. Partner with your doctor on that, and tell your doctor how you're feeling. If you get depressed, it's important to get treated for that. Look for ways to connect online and in person with people who have experience with Cushing's syndrome.

For instance, if you have too much cortisol because you're taking steroid medicines, your doctor will check to see if you can stop taking the drugs, or take a lower dose. If a tumor is causing your Cushing's syndrome, you'll likely have other tests to determine the location of the tumor first before deciding on your treatment"".

When your body has too much of it, the excess hormone can throw off your body's other systems. Most cases of Cushing's syndrome can be cured, though it may take some time for your symptoms to ease up. The condition, also known as hypercortisolism, is more common in women than men. It's most often seen in people ages 25 to 40. You can get Cushing's syndrome when there's too much cortisol in your body for too long. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys. The most common cause is related to medications called glucocorticoids, also commonly known as steroids or prednisone. These prescription steroids are used for conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or after an organ transplant. They are powerful anti-inflammatory medications. Taking too much, for too long, can lead to Cushing's syndrome. A tumor in your pituitary gland, found at the base of the brain, or a tumor in the adrenal glands, can also prompt your body to make too much cortisol, which can lead to Cushing's. It's not usually a condition that's passed in families. In some rare cases, though, people develop it because a problem in their genes makes them more likely to get tumors on their glands. Your case might be different than someone else's, but when the disease is full-blown, common symptoms are: Rounded, rosy face Weight gain, especially upper body A fat pad in the upper back or base of the neck (you may hear this called a 'buffalo hump') Thinning skin that is easy to bruise Acne Being very tired Weak muscles, especially when using your shoulders and hip muscles High blood pressure High blood sugar levels Depression and anxiety Osteoporosis Kidney stones Sleep problems Extra hair growth on your body and face Irregular periods Low sex drive and problems having an erection Your skin could become thin, heal slowly, and bruise easily. You might get purple or pink stretch marks all over your body, especially your belly, thighs, arms, and chest. Your bones may get weak. Everyday movements like bending, lifting, or even getting out of a chair can cause backaches or breaks in your ribs or spine. Children with Cushing's syndrome are usually very heavy, what doctors call obese, and tend to grow slowly. It might take several appointments to settle on your diagnosis. When you go to your doctor, she'll do a physical exam and ask you questions. What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? Are you feeling more emotional? What medications are you taking? Your doctor will probably also recommend some of these tests to help screen for Cushing's syndrome if she suspects you have it: 24-hour urinary free cortisol test. This common test collects your urine for 24 hours to measure how much cortisol is in it. Dexamethasone suppression test . You'll take a low-dose steroid pill at 11:00 p.m. and then take a blood test in the morning to see how much cortisol your body still makes. Late-night salivary cortisol level. This test measures cortisol in your saliva. As the name suggests, these tests happen at night. If you have Cushing's syndrome, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who will do other blood tests or imaging scans to find out what's causing it. Will my symptoms change? If so, how? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? How will we know if they're working? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? When will I start to feel better? Does this condition put me at risk for any others? The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. That will lead to how to treat your condition. For instance, if you have too much cortisol because you're taking steroid medicines, your doctor will check to see if you can stop taking the drugs, or take a lower dose. If a tumor is causing your Cushing's syndrome, you'll likely have other tests to determine the location of the tumor first before deciding on your treatment. Surgery to remove the tumor may be best. If not, your doctor may be able to shrink the tumor with radiation or medicine. Eating well is an important part of living with Cushing's. A healthy diet can ease some symptoms and prevent others. Protect your bones by eating foods with calcium and vitamin D. Limit how much sodium and fatty foods you eat. A nutritionist can help you make sure you're getting enough of the right nutrients. Let your family and friends know what you're going through. Ask for their support, and let them know how they can help. Take time for the people and activities you enjoy. It's OK to say no and set limits, so you keep your energy up. If you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to a counselor or therapist. Your doctor may be able to give you a referral. Your symptoms and how long they'll last depend on: The amount of extra cortisol you have The cause of your high cortisol How long you've had the condition Your overall health Most of the time Cushing's syndrome can be treated and cured. If your Cushing's syndrome isn't curable, you'll want to look for ways to manage your weight gain, muscle weakness, and tiredness. Partner with your doctor on that, and tell your doctor how you're feeling. If you get depressed, it's important to get treated for that. Look for ways to connect online and in person with people who have experience with Cushing's syndrome.

Can I drink alcohol while taking metronidazole for Crohn's?,MASH,"""Avoid alcohol if you're taking metronidazole.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> If you have mild to moderate Crohn's, your doctor may give you antibiotics to help keep your disease under control. You may need to take the antibiotics even after you feel better to keep your symptoms from getting worse again. There are two ways these drugs treat the inflammation in your gut from Crohn's. Researchers believe they might help control symptoms by reducing bacteria levels in your intestine and by curbing the intestine's immune system. You'll also get them to treat specific infections and complications. Abscesses. These are pockets of pus that, in Crohn's, often form near the anus. Fistulas. These are abnormal tunnels that go from one part of your intestine to another or to nearby areas, such as the bladder, vagina, anus, or skin. Pouchitis. For some people, Crohn's disease is so severe that they need an operation to have their colon removed. The surgeon makes an internal pouch to hold solid waste before it leaves your body. If this area becomes inflamed -- known as 'pouchitis' -- you'll need antibiotics for treatment. The most common ones used for Crohn's are: Ciprofloxacin ( Cipro) Metronidazole ( Flagyl) Some people need to get antibiotics through a vein ( IV). Side effects of metronidazole may include: Nausea Loss of appetite Metallic taste Diarrhea Dizziness Headaches Dark urine Side effects are more common at higher doses. With metronidazole, you may also have numbness or tingling in your hands. If you do, you'll need to stop taking it. Although this side effect is rare, sometimes it doesn't go away. Seizures are another rare, serious side effect. Avoid alcohol if you're taking metronidazole. It can interact with the drug to cause a rare but severe reaction. The symptoms are nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. These side effects of ciprofloxacin are rare, but may include: Headache and severe dizziness Nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea Sensitivity to sun Rupture of a tendon (very rare) Confusion Depression Hallucinations Fast heartbeat You're also at greater risk for a severe type of colitis. If you get it, you'll need treatment with another type of antibiotic. Do not take ciprofloxacin within a couple of hours of taking: Antacids Vitamin or mineral supplements that contain calcium, iron, or zinc This combination can make the antibiotic less effective. No matter which antibiotic you're taking: Let your doctor know if you're pregnant before starting the medication. Wear sunscreen during daylight hours.

Cigarette smoke irritates your bladder. It can also cause a hacking cough, which could trigger leaks. Talk to your doctor about OAB. He can prescribe a drug that'll help you regain your quality of life. Medications for OAB relax the bladder muscle, increase urine storage and control bladder muscle spasms.by blocking nerve signals in your brain. Doctors prescribe them to both men and women. They include: Darifenacin ( Enablex) Fesoterodine ( Toviaz) Mirabegron ( Myrbetriq). Oxybutynin ( Ditropan, Ditropan XL) Oxybutynin gel or patch ( Gelnique, Oxytrol), which you rub or place on your skin Solifenacin ( VESIcare) Tolterodine ( Detrol, Detrol LA) Trospium ( Sanctura, Sanctura XR) Women who've been through menopause can also use a form of the hormone estrogen that you apply inside your vagina. Doctors also treat men with drugs that relax a muscle at the bladder neck and prostate to help with emptying. They include: Alfuzosin ( Uroxatral) Doxazosin ( Cardura, Cardura XL) Silodosin ( Rapaflo) Tamsulosin ( Flomax) Botox injections: Onabotulinumtoxin A ( Botox) blocks nerve activity in the muscles of your bladder so it relaxes. That helps it hold urine and ease OAB. You'll get the shots in your doctor's office. About 6% of patients who receive botox may temporarily be unable to pee. You must be able and willing to catheterize if you cannot pee after botox. Your doctor may suggest them if other methods don't help. You'll get them in his office or a clinic. Sacral nerve stimulation: The doctor uses electricity to stimulate the nerves that control your bladder. He'll place a small device under the skin in your butt. It sends mild electric charges through a wire to a nerve in your lower back. This helps build bladder control. This procedure is commonly referred to as a bladder pacemaker. The main limitation with this treatment is the inability to obtain a spinal MRI. Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation: The doctor places a needle on nerves near your ankle that affect bladder control. You'll have one session a week for 12 weeks, then maintenance treatments as needed. This procedure is done in the office. In rare cases, augmentation cystoplasty, where intestine is used to make the bladder bigger or urinary diversion, an alternate route for bladder drainage for severe, complicated OAB patients may be considered Overactive bladder doesn't have to get in the way of your daily life.

How can you train your bladder to help your OAB?,MASH,""" Kegel exercises. Over time, these help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. They also build up the muscle that controls the flow of urine from your body.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> If you have an overactive bladder ( OAB), it may feel like your condition controls your life. But it doesn't have to. There are many ways to treat it. These include simple changes in behavior and lifestyle, medications, and alternative treatments. Simple changes to your daily routine can help you manage OAB symptoms: Kegel exercises. Over time, these help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. They also build up the muscle that controls the flow of urine from your body. When it works like it should, it helps you to hold your pee until you can get to the bathroom. When it doesn't, you have leaks. To do Kegels, pretend you're going to pee, then squeeze the muscles you'd use to stop it. You'll have to do them a few times a day for 6 to 8 weeks before you see a change in your OAB symptoms. Train your bladder. This works a lot like Kegels. Hold your pee when you feel like you need to go. It's easier if you do it while sitting down. Sit still, and squeeze your pelvic floor muscles several times in a row. When the urge to pee passes, walk slowly to the bathroom. Be patient. It may take up to 8 weeks to see results. Watch what you eat and drink. Ask your doctor if you should limit how much you drink at certain times of the day. He might also tell you to avoid coffee, tea, alcohol, sodas, and juices. Ditto for fruits like oranges and grapefruit, and spicy foods. All of them can make your OAB symptoms worse. Keep your weight down. Exercise and weight loss can improve urinary incontinence and OAB symptoms. It'll ease the stress on your bladder and lead to fewer accidents. Double void. This means you pee, wait a few minutes, and then go again. It'll help make sure your bladder's empty. That way, you can avoid a quick trip back to the bathroom.

Most bone tumors are benign, which means they are not cancer and do not spread to other areas of the body. But they may still weaken bone and lead to broken bones or cause other problems. Bone cancer destroys normal bone tissue. It may start in the bone or spread from other parts of the body (called metastasis). Benign tumors are more common than tumors caused by cancer. These are a few common types of benign bone tumors: Osteochondroma is the most common benign bone tumor. It is more common in people under age 20. Giant cell tumor is a benign tumor, typically in the leg (malignant types of this tumor are uncommon). Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor, often found in long bones, that happens commonly in the early 20s. Osteoblastoma is a rare, benign tumor that grows in the spine and long bones, mostly in young adults. Enchondroma usually appears in bones of the hands and feet. It often has no symptoms. It is the most common type of hand tumor. Cancer that's in your bones has most often come from cancer elsewhere in your body. For example, if lung cancer has spread to your bones, that's secondary bone cancer. Any cancer that moves from one part of the body to another is called metastatic cancer. Cancers that commonly spread to bone include: Breast cancer Prostate cancer Lung cancer Primary bone cancer, or bone sarcoma, is a cancerous tumor that starts in the bone. The cause is not certain, but heredity may play a role. Radiation therapy or cancer drugs may raise your chances of getting this type of cancer. As with all cancer, if primary bone cancer spreads to other places in your body, it's called metastatic cancer. These are some of the most common types of primary bone cancer: Osteosarcoma is most common around the knee and upper arm. Most of the time, it is found in teens and young adults. There is an adult form of this tumor that is usually seen in people with Paget's disease of bone. Ewing's sarcoma also is seen in younger people between the ages of 5 and 20. The ribs, pelvis, leg, and upper arm are the most common sites. It usually shows up in bone, but it can also start in soft tissue around bones. Chondrosarcoma happens most often in people between 40 and 70. The hip, pelvis, leg, arm, and shoulder are common sites of this cancer, which begins in cartilage cells. Although almost always found in bone, multiple myelomais not a primary bone cancer. It is a bone marrow cancer. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones. You may have no symptoms of a bone tumor, whether it's cancer or not. This is common. Your doctor may find a tumor when looking at an X-ray of another problem, such as a sprain. But symptoms may include pain that: Is in the area of the tumor Is dull or achy May get worse with activity Wakes you at night Trauma does not cause a bone tumor, but a bone that is weakened by a tumor may break more easily. This can cause severe pain. Other symptoms related to bone tumors may include: Fevers Night sweats Swelling around a bone Limping If you think you might have a bone tumor, see your doctor right way. Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history and do a physical exam. You may need blood and imaging tests. To confirm a diagnosis, your doctor may remove tissue with a needle or through a cut and have it examined under a microscope for signs of cancer. This is called a biopsy. Cancerous bone tumors need more aggressive treatment. Benign tumors are watched or may be treated with medication. Your doctor may remove benign tumors that are more likely to spread or become cancer. In some cases, tumors come back, even after treatment. Tumors caused by bone cancer, whether primary or metastatic, may need the attention of several cancer specialists. Treatment depends on how far it has spread, called its stage. Cancer cells confined to the bone tumor and surrounding area are at a localized stage. Bone cancers that spread to or from other areas of the body are more serious and a cure is more difficult. Cancers of the bone are most often removed with surgery. These are the common types of treatment for bone cancer: Limb salvage surgery removes the part of the bone with cancer. Nearby muscles, tendons, and other tissues are not removed. A metallic implant replaces the portion of bone that was removed. Amputation may be done if a tumor is large or extends to nerves and blood vessels. You may get a prosthetic limb after amputation. Radiation therapy kills cancer cells and shrinks tumors with high-dose X-rays. It is often used in combination with surgery and may be used before or after surgery. Chemotherapy kills tumor cells with cancer drugs. Chemotherapy may be given before surgery, after surgery, or for metastatic disease. Your doctor may recommend that you join a clinical trial.

How can you prevent back pain?,MASH,"""We often bring on our back problems through bad habits, such as: Poor posture, like sitting incorrectly at a desk or behind the steering wheel Repeating the same motion or overdoing it Pushing, pulling, and lifting things carelessly""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> There's a lot riding on your spinal column. It's your body's main structural support. It needs to keep you stable enough to stand upright but flexible enough for movement. So it's no surprise that many people have back problems from time to time. The hurt can stem from sore muscles, ligaments, and tendons, or from herniated disks, fractures, and other problems in your upper, middle, and lower back. Sometimes you feel the effects right away. But in many cases, back problems develop over time. We often bring on our back problems through bad habits, such as: Poor posture, like sitting incorrectly at a desk or behind the steering wheel Repeating the same motion or overdoing it Pushing, pulling, and lifting things carelessly The spine is actually a stack of 24 bones called vertebrae. A healthy spine is S-shaped when viewed from the side. It curves back at your shoulders and inward at your neck and small of your back. It houses and protects your spinal cord, the network of nerves that transmit feeling and control movement throughout your entire body. One of the more common types of back pain comes from straining the bands of muscles surrounding the spine. It happens most often in the curve of the low back and the base of the neck. These areas support more weight than your upper and mid back, which are less prone to trouble. Injuries from contact sports, accidents, and falls can cause problems ranging from minor muscle strains, to herniated disks, to fractures that damage to the spinal column or cord. Stabbing low back pain could be from muscle spasms, when your muscles seize up and don't relax, like a cramp. Osteoarthritis can affect your vertebrae, when the cartilage between them wears down. Bone spurs or a herniated disk can push on nerves. Pregnancy often brings on back pain, too. Hormonal changes and weight gain put new kinds of stresses on a pregnant woman's spine and legs. Sometimes your back might be sore for no clear reason. That's called nonspecific backache. It could come from weak muscles that can't handle everyday walking, bending, and stretching. Back pain -- whether a dull ache or shooting -- is just one sign that something's going on with your back. You may also have feelings in your legs or arms: Radiating pain Numbness Tingling Weakness Uncontrolled peeing or pooping could mean a serious problem like spinal cord compression. Call your doctor right away. You should see a doctor: After you get hurt, like in a fall or accident When the pain gets in the way of your daily activities If it lasts longer than 6 weeks, or spreads During your exam, your doctor will test your range of motion -- unless you can't move -- and check how well your nerves are working. That may be enough to decide what to do next. You might need imaging tests, like X-rays, an MRI, or a CT scan. But they're not always useful, and there's not always a direct link between the results of these tests and how much it hurts. Your specific treatment will depend on what's causing your pain and where in your back it is. Despite what you may think or have been told before, staying in bed isn't usually the answer; gentle exercise is. It will help work out the kinks, build support for your spine, and improve your flexibility. A physical therapist can work with you to design a set of exercises, give you relief from the pain, and get you moving again. Over-the-counter pain relievers, ice, and heat will work to take the edge off most back pain. Your doctor can prescribe stronger medicines, but some can make you drowsy or dependent on them if you're not careful. Complementary therapies, such as chiropractic spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage, can help ease pain, too. If a bone is damaged, or you have a herniated disk or pinched nerve, you may need surgery. But for ongoing back pain, doctors will try other treatments first. Counseling could help you learn to live with chronic pain better as well as deal with symptoms of depression because of it. Exercise! Strengthening the muscles around your spine and in your core will help keep you stable and balanced. Walking is great for your low back, and it's simple to do. Practice good posture. As a rule of thumb, aim to keep your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned when you sit, stand, and walk. Lift heavy things correctly, using your hips and knees for power while keeping your back straight. Try sleeping on your side, with a medium-firm mattress. Don't smoke.

What can you do to stay healthy with small lymphocytic lymphoma?,MASH,"""Try your best to avoid infections. Eat a healthy diet, get proper rest, and stay away from sick people. Ask your doctor about which vaccinations you should receive, such as shots to prevent flu and pneumonia. Living with a serious illness poses many challenges, both physically and emotionally. For strength and support, surround yourself with those who care about you. They can offer comfort, as well as practical support. You may also find it helpful to talk to a professional counselor, spiritual leader, or a support group.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL) is a cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called a 'lymphocyte,' which helps your body fight infection. You may hear your doctor refer to SLL as a 'non- Hodgkin's lymphoma,' which is a group of cancers that affect lymphocytes. When you have SLL, too many ineffective lymphocytes live and multiply in your lymph nodes. These are pea-sized organs in your neck, groin, armpits, and elsewhere, that are part of your immune system. SLL tends to grow slowly. You may not have any symptoms when you're first diagnosed. A lot of people find out they have SLL when it's detected after a blood test for another reason. If you're not having symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. Instead, your doctor will watch your health regularly and won't suggest therapy until you need it. For some people, treatment knocks out the cancer for good, or keeps it from coming back for a long time. It's normal to have worries and questions about any serious condition. Learn about your treatment options, and seek out family and friends for support. They can help you get through the emotional and physical challenges ahead. You can't 'catch' SLL like you do a cold or infection. It's also not passed on from parents to children. Doctors don't know exactly what causes it. They do know, though, that the disease is rare in people under 50. The average age that people get diagnosed with the disease is 65. And it affects men more than women. A few things are linked to a higher risk of getting SLL: You have a condition that causes you to have a weak immune system, like HIV/ AIDS. You've had chemotherapy. You live or work in a farming community. That's possibly because of exposure to pesticides and herbicides. You might not have any obvious symptoms when you're diagnosed with SLL. The disease might be found during a routine blood test. About one-third of all people with SLL live for years without having symptoms. When symptoms appear, they may include: Painless swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin Loss of appetite Fatigue Night sweats Fever Weight loss Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Have you ever noticed any swelling in your neck, armpit, or groin? Are you often tired? Is your appetite down lately? Have you lost any weight recently? Your doctor may also ask you to get a lymph node biopsy. This is the main test to diagnose SLL. Your doctor removes the lymph node and checks it under a microscope for signs of cancer. Many lymph nodes are near the surface of your skin. If that's the case, your doctor will give you a shot that numbs your skin. Then he'll make a cut and remove the lymph node. You can usually go home the same day. You'll have a small wound with a few stitches that can be removed in about a week. Your doctor may also do two bone marrow tests -- a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy -- to find out how advanced your cancer is. They are usually done together as part of a single procedure that removes marrow from the back of your hip bone. For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor first numbs the skin over your hip and the surface of the bone. He then inserts a thin needle into the bone and uses a syringe to suck out a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Usually the doctor does the bone marrow biopsy next. He removes a small piece of bone and marrow with a slightly larger needle. What stage is my cancer? Do I need treatment right now? What are my treatment options? Are there side effects to the treatments? How will my daily life be affected? What kind of follow-up care and monitoring will I need? If you have no symptoms, your doctor might recommend 'watchful waiting.' During this period, he'll monitor you and start treatment if the disease starts to get worse. If you need treatment, you have several options: Chemotherapy. You can get various chemotherapy drugs that kill your cancer cells. The medicine comes in pill form or may be given through an IV. You may be treated with one drug or a combination. Chemotherapy is a key treatment for SLL and can often put the disease in remission, which means you no longer have any signs of cancer, although it can return. Monoclonal antibody therapy. These are drugs that act like man-made antibodies that specifically target cancer cells. They help your immune system destroy them. Rituximab ( Rituxan, Rituxan Hycela) and alemtuzumab ( Campath) are two common types. You get both through an IV. Radiation therapy. This uses high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in one or two groups of lymph nodes in the same part of the body. It may be useful if you're in the earlier stages of SLL and the disease hasn't spread. Targeted therapy. These drugs attack one or more specific targets on cancer cells. Your doctor might suggest them if you've already had another treatment that didn't work. Two examples are ibrutinib ( Imbruvica) and idelalisib ( Zydelig). Both are pills. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat SLL in clinical trials. These test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Besides new drugs, another treatment that may be part of a clinical trial is a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they're referring to 'embryo' stem cells that are used in cloning. The stem cells in a transplant are different. They live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. This procedure may use your own stem cells or stem cells from a donor. If a donor supplies them, you'll need to find one who is the right match for you, so your body doesn't reject the new stem cells, or start fighting them the way it would fight an infection. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who's the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you'll most likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. Sometimes radiation therapy is also used. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. Certain medications can make these side effects less severe. When the high-dose chemo is done, you'll start the transplant. You get the new stem cells through an IV. You won't feel any pain from this, and you're awake while it's happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. Try your best to avoid infections. Eat a healthy diet, get proper rest, and stay away from sick people. Ask your doctor about which vaccinations you should receive, such as shots to prevent flu and pneumonia. Living with a serious illness poses many challenges, both physically and emotionally. For strength and support, surround yourself with those who care about you. They can offer comfort, as well as practical support. You may also find it helpful to talk to a professional counselor, spiritual leader, or a support group. SLL tends to be a slow-growing cancer. In time, though, SLL can turn into a more aggressive type of lymphoma. After initial treatment for SLL, many people have a period of remission, when there are no signs of active disease. The illness may not return. But for some people, SLL does come back. If the lymphoma returns, doctors can treat you again. Treatment for disease that returns can be successful, and you may have another period of remission. This keeps your lymphoma under control for many years.

""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> If it is not controlled, diabetes can cause a host of complications that can affect nearly every organ in the body. Diabetes complications include: Heart disease Stroke Kidney disease Nerve damage Eye damage Digestion problems Erectile dysfunction Skin problems Infection Dental problems Heart disease is one of the most common diabetes complications. In office visits, your doctor may perform various tests to check for heart disease and help you prevent any serious heart-related problems. At every visit, your health care provider will check your blood pressure. Your cholesterol level and triglycerides may be checked at your first visit. A baseline EKG should also be obtained as part of a complete medical record. Learn more about personal risk factors you have for heart disease, such as a family history or whether you smoke, and work out a prevention plan that includes weight loss, regular exercise, and stress management, as well as keeping your blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides at normal levels. Signs and symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness on one side of the face or body; numbness in the face, arm, or leg; difficulty speaking; trouble seeing with both eyes; or dizziness. If you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor immediately. You may be referred to a neurologist or other stroke specialist. Read more about the warning signs of stroke and also be aware of ways to prevent this serious problem from happening to you. If you have diabetes, urine testing should be performed yearly to look for diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease. A baseline creatinine blood test should also be done to determine your kidney function. Your health care provider will also check your blood pressure regularly, because control of high blood pressure is essential in slowing kidney disease. Blood pressure should be less than 130/80. Read about other symptoms of kidney disease in this health topic, such as persistent leg or feet swelling. Find out when to call your doctor to prevent serious problems. Over time, diabetes can cause nerve damage that produces symptoms of numbness, burning, or pain. If your skin becomes numb, you may not notice small wounds that could grow to become bigger health threats. Check your feet and hands daily for redness, calluses, cracks, or skin breakdown. If you notice any of these symptoms before your next scheduled visit, notify your health care provider immediately. To protect your vision, all people with diabetes should see an ophthalmologist (an eye doctor) at least yearly. As part of the eye exam the doctor will dilate your eyes so that he or she can see the back of the eye (retina) and determine if the diabetes is causing damage. In people with type 1 diabetes, these annual exams should start within three to five years of diabetes once the patient is age 10 or older. People with type 2 diabetes should have their first eye exam once they are diagnosed. Those with eye complications may need to see their ophthalmologist more frequently. Women with diabetes who become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye exam during the first trimester and close follow-up with an eye doctor during their pregnancy. ( This recommendation does not apply to women who develop gestational diabetes.) Diabetes increases your risk of gastroparesis. With gastroparesis, the nerves to the stomach are damaged and stop working properly. This causes the stomach to take too long to empty its contents and makes it difficult to manage blood glucose levels. Sometimes, changing your diet can help. There are some medications and treatments for gastroparesis. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent diabetes complications. Ask for information on early warning signs so you can seek treatment when it is most effective. Diabetes increases the chance of developing erectile dysfunction, or impotence. For some men, adopting a healthier lifestyle, such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and reducing stress, may be all that is needed to resolve erectile dysfunction. In this health topic, you'll also learn why it's important to talk to your health care provider about your erectile dysfunction, as your doctor can recommend other remedies -- including medications, a vacuum constriction device ( VCD), and other erectile dysfunction aids -- that can help. As many as a third of people with diabetes will have a skin condition related to their disease at some time in their lives. High levels of glucose in the blood provide an excellent breeding ground for bacteria and fungi and can reduce the body's ability to heal itself. Fortunately, most skin conditions can be prevented and successfully treated if caught early. If your skin is not cared for properly with type 2 diabetes, a minor skin condition can turn into a serious problem with potentially severe consequences. Type 2 diabetes slows down your body's ability to fight infection. High blood glucose leads to high levels of sugar in your body's tissues. When this happens, bacteria grow and infections can develop more quickly. Common sites of infection are your bladder, kidneys, vagina, gums, feet, and skin. Early treatment of infections can prevent more serious complications. People with diabetes face a higher than normal risk of serious dental and oral health problems. The more uncontrolled the blood sugar, the more likely dental and oral health problems will arise. This is because uncontrolled diabetes impairs white blood cells, which are the body's main defense against infections that can occur in the mouth. Whether you have diabetes or not, be sure brush, floss and rinse with antiseptic mouthwash daily.

What lifestyle changes can I implement to treat multiple sclerosis?,MASH,"""Get regular exercise and avoid too much heat to boost your energy. Ask your doctor about trying yoga to ease fatigue or stress. Take care of your emotional health, too. It's OK to ask family, friends, or a counselor for help with any stress or anxiety you may feel. Support groups are also great places to connect with other people living with MS.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a long-lasting disease that can affect your brain, spinal cord, and the optic nerves in your eyes. It can cause problems with vision, balance, muscle control, and other basic body functions. The effects are often different for everyone who has the disease. Some people have mild symptoms and don't need treatment. Others will have trouble getting around and doing daily tasks. MS happens when your immune system attacks a fatty material called myelin, which wraps around your nerve fibers to protect them. Without this outer shell, your nerves become damaged. Scar tissue may form. The damage means your brain can't send signals through your body correctly. Your nerves also don't work as they should to help you move and feel. As a result, you may have symptoms like: Trouble walking Feeling tired Muscle weakness or spasms Blurred or double vision Numbness and tingling Sexual problems Poor bladder or bowel control Pain Depression Problems focusing or remembering The first symptoms often start between ages 20 and 40. Most people with MS have attacks, also called relapses, when the condition gets noticeably worse. They're usually followed by times of recovery when symptoms improve. For other people, the disease continues to get worse over time. In recent years, scientists have found many new treatments that can often help prevent relapses and slow the disease's effects. Doctors don't know for sure what causes MS, but there are many things that seem to make the disease more likely. People with certain genes may have higher chances of getting it. Smoking also may raise the risk. Some people may get MS after they've had a viral infection -- like the Epstein- Barr virus or the human herpesvirus 6 -- that makes their immune system stop working normally. The infection may trigger the disease or cause relapses. Scientists are studying the link between viruses and MS, but they don't have a clear answer yet. Some studies suggest that vitamin D, which you can get from sunlight, may strengthen your immune system and protect you from MS. Some people with higher chances of getting the disease who move to sunnier regions seem to lower their risk. It can be hard to diagnose MS, since its symptoms can be the same as many other nerve disorders. If your doctor thinks you have it, he'll want you to see a specialist who treats the brain and nervous system, called a neurologist. She'll ask you about your medical history and check you for key signs of nerve damage in your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. There's no single test that can prove you have MS. Your doctor will use a few different ones to check you. These may include: Blood tests to rule out diseases that cause similar symptoms, like Lyme disease and AIDS. Checks of your balance, coordination, vision, and other functions to see how well your nerves are working. A test that makes detailed pictures of the structures in your body, called an MRI. Analysis of the liquid that cushions your brain and spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF). People with MS usually have specific proteins in their CSF. Tests (called evoked potentials) that measure the electrical activity in your brain. There is no cure for MS right now, but a number of treatments can improve how you feel and keep your body working well. Your doctor can also prescribe drugs that may slow the course of the disease, prevent or treat attacks, ease your symptoms, or help you manage the stress that can come with the condition. Drugs that may slow your MS or help nerve damage include: Beta interferon ( Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) Copolymer-1 ( Copaxone) Dalfampridine ( Ampyra) Dimethyl fumarate ( Tecfidera) Mitoxantrone ( Novantrone) Natalizumab ( Tysabri) Ocrelizumab ( Ocrevus) Teriflunomide ( Aubagio) Your doctor may give you steroids to make your MS attacks shorter and less severe. You can also try other drugs, like muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, or botulinum toxin ( Botox), to ease muscle spasms and treat some of the other symptoms. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will keep up your strength and balance and help you manage fatigue and pain. An occupational therapist can teach you new ways to do certain tasks to make it easier to work and take care of yourself. If you have trouble getting around, a cane, walker, or braces can help you walk more easily. Along with treatment, you can do other things to ease your MS symptoms. Get regular exercise and avoid too much heat to boost your energy. Ask your doctor about trying yoga to ease fatigue or stress. Take care of your emotional health, too. It's OK to ask family, friends, or a counselor for help with any stress or anxiety you may feel. Support groups are also great places to connect with other people living with MS. Research is giving doctors more treatment options for the condition, a better idea of what causes it, and the ability to diagnose it earlier. Stem-cell and genetic research may soon help doctors repair damaged nerves or stop the disease before it causes damage. Scientists are also looking for new ways to treat MS in clinical trials.

Can I get retinopathy if I have gestational diabetes?,MASH,""" It's important that anyone who has diabetes gets annual eye exams from an ophthalmologist so diabetic retinopathy can be detected early.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> In people with diabetes, high blood sugar damages the walls of the small blood vessels in the eye, altering their structure and function. These vessels may thicken, leak, develop clots, close off, or grow balloon-like defects called microaneurysms. Frequently, fluid accumulates in the part of the retina used in tasks such as reading; this condition is called macular edema. In advanced cases, the retina is robbed of its blood supply and grows new, but defective, vessels -- a process called neovascularization. These fragile vessels can bleed, creating vision-impairing hemorrhages, scar tissue, and separation of the retina from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). The new vessels can also block fluid flow within the eye, producing glaucoma. It's important that anyone who has diabetes gets annual eye exams from an ophthalmologist so diabetic retinopathy can be detected early. When you visit an ophthalmologist, he or she will question you about your medical history and vision and will ask you to read an eye chart. The doctor will then directly examine your retina using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. Some of the features of diabetic retinopathy cannot be seen during a basic eye exam and require special exams. To get a better look at the inside of the eye, your doctor might administer drops to dilate your pupils and will then view the retina with lenses and a special light called a slit lamp. A test called fluorescein angiography can reveal changes in the structure and function of the retinal blood vessels. For this test, the doctor injects a fluorescent yellow dye into one of your veins and then photographs your retina as the dye outlines the blood vessels. The eye exam will likely also include a check for glaucoma and cataracts, both of which occur more frequently in people with diabetes and can cause vision problems. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy should involve both a medical doctor and an ophthalmologist. Your medical doctor can help you better control blood sugar and can treat other complications of diabetes that may worsen diabetic retinopathy, such as impaired kidney or heart function. Your ophthalmologist can directly treat retinopathy with a laser or a surgical procedure called vitrectomy, to prevent further vascular changes and preserve vision. Don't be surprised if your doctor recommends one of these treatments before you notice any vision problems: Before problems start is usually the best time for treatment. Laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy, called laser photocoagulation, works in part by creating tiny, painless retinal burns that seal off leaking vessels and reduce swelling. The number of burns the doctor makes and the number of treatments you need depend on the type and extent of your retinopathy and how well it responds to treatment. You may have to wait several months to find out if this treatment is improving your condition. Your doctor may recommend vitrectomy surgery if you have a hemorrhage that doesn't clear, if you have retinal detachment, or if laser treatment doesn't sufficiently halt the growth of new vessels. During vitrectomy, your doctor drains the gel-like substance inside the eye, allowing her to clear any lingering blood and to remove scar tissue. The vitreous fluid is then replaced with a substitute fluid. Rare complications of treatment may include blurred vision, headache, glaucoma, difficulty seeing in the dark, decreased peripheral and color vision, and bleeding. In most cases when treatment is recommended, the benefits outweigh the risks. Although both of these treatments can be very effective, your expectations for either treatment should be realistic. Typically laser or surgical treatment will not restore lost vision; however, treatment can prevent any additional loss of eyesight. If you already have vision loss, your doctor can counsel you about options for visual rehabilitation. Diabetic retinopathy can be minimized with a combination of strict blood sugar control and routine screening with eye exams -- though even with optimal medical care, it is not always possible to prevent or slow retinal damage. Studies have shown that maintaining near-normal blood sugar can decrease the chance of developing retinopathy and can help keep existing retinopathy from getting worse. Your doctor can provide you with guidelines that may include insulin and other medications, dietary modifications, and exercise.

Can I get retinopathy if I have gestational diabetes?,MASH,"""You or your child has been diagnosed with diabetes and you have not discussed retinopathy and routine eye exams with your doctor.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> In people with diabetes, high blood sugar damages the walls of the small blood vessels in the eye, altering their structure and function. These vessels may thicken, leak, develop clots, close off, or grow balloon-like defects called microaneurysms. Frequently, fluid accumulates in the part of the retina used in tasks such as reading; this condition is called macular edema. In advanced cases, the retina is robbed of its blood supply and grows new, but defective, vessels -- a process called neovascularization. These fragile vessels can bleed, creating vision-impairing hemorrhages, scar tissue, and separation of the retina from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). The new vessels can also block fluid flow within the eye, producing glaucoma. It's important that anyone who has diabetes gets annual eye exams from an ophthalmologist so diabetic retinopathy can be detected early. When you visit an ophthalmologist, he or she will question you about your medical history and vision and will ask you to read an eye chart. The doctor will then directly examine your retina using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. Some of the features of diabetic retinopathy cannot be seen during a basic eye exam and require special exams. To get a better look at the inside of the eye, your doctor might administer drops to dilate your pupils and will then view the retina with lenses and a special light called a slit lamp. A test called fluorescein angiography can reveal changes in the structure and function of the retinal blood vessels. For this test, the doctor injects a fluorescent yellow dye into one of your veins and then photographs your retina as the dye outlines the blood vessels. The eye exam will likely also include a check for glaucoma and cataracts, both of which occur more frequently in people with diabetes and can cause vision problems. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy should involve both a medical doctor and an ophthalmologist. Your medical doctor can help you better control blood sugar and can treat other complications of diabetes that may worsen diabetic retinopathy, such as impaired kidney or heart function. Your ophthalmologist can directly treat retinopathy with a laser or a surgical procedure called vitrectomy, to prevent further vascular changes and preserve vision. Don't be surprised if your doctor recommends one of these treatments before you notice any vision problems: Before problems start is usually the best time for treatment. Laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy, called laser photocoagulation, works in part by creating tiny, painless retinal burns that seal off leaking vessels and reduce swelling. The number of burns the doctor makes and the number of treatments you need depend on the type and extent of your retinopathy and how well it responds to treatment. You may have to wait several months to find out if this treatment is improving your condition. Your doctor may recommend vitrectomy surgery if you have a hemorrhage that doesn't clear, if you have retinal detachment, or if laser treatment doesn't sufficiently halt the growth of new vessels. During vitrectomy, your doctor drains the gel-like substance inside the eye, allowing her to clear any lingering blood and to remove scar tissue. The vitreous fluid is then replaced with a substitute fluid. Rare complications of treatment may include blurred vision, headache, glaucoma, difficulty seeing in the dark, decreased peripheral and color vision, and bleeding. In most cases when treatment is recommended, the benefits outweigh the risks. Although both of these treatments can be very effective, your expectations for either treatment should be realistic. Typically laser or surgical treatment will not restore lost vision; however, treatment can prevent any additional loss of eyesight. If you already have vision loss, your doctor can counsel you about options for visual rehabilitation. Diabetic retinopathy can be minimized with a combination of strict blood sugar control and routine screening with eye exams -- though even with optimal medical care, it is not always possible to prevent or slow retinal damage.

Millions of people suffer from performance anxiety, commonly called 'stage fright.' In fact, most people would rather get the flu than perform. Athletes, musicians, actors, and public speakers often get performance anxiety. Performance anxiety can prevent you from doing what you enjoy and can affect your career. Worst of all, performance anxiety can negatively affect your self-esteem and self-confidence. Although it may be impossible to totally overcome performance anxiety, there are many things you can do to control your emotions and reduce anxiety. Being the center of attention and having all eyes on you can be stressful. Your body reacts to this situation in much the same way as it would if you were being attacked. Your body's 'fight-or-flight' mechanism kicks in, which is why symptoms of stage fright are similar to symptoms that occur when you are in real danger. Performance anxiety symptoms may include: Racing pulse and rapid breathing Dry mouth and tight throat Trembling hands, knees, lips, and voice Sweaty and cold hands Nausea and an uneasy feeling in your stomach Vision changes Simply put, stress and anxiety about performing in front of people causes performance anxiety. Confronting your fears and vulnerabilities, accepting yourself for who you are, and not feeling like you have to prove yourself to others, is the first step toward overcoming performance anxiety. Keep in mind that nobody is perfect, nobody expects you to be perfect, and it is OK to make mistakes. The second step is learning how to redirect your negative thoughts, beliefs, images, and predictions about performing in public. Doing this is not as difficult as you might think. Here are 10 tips to help you overcome your fears and shine on stage, on the field, or at the podium: Be prepared: practice, practice, practice. Limit caffeine and sugar intake the day of the performance. Eat a sensible meal a few hours before you are to perform so that you have energy and don't get hungry. A low-fat meal including complex carbohydrates -- whole-grain pasta, lentil soup, yogurt, or a bean and rice burrito -- is a good choice. Shift the focus off of yourself and your fear to the enjoyment you are providing to the spectators. Close your eyes and imagine the audience laughing and cheering, and you feeling good. Don't focus on what could go wrong. Instead focus on the positive. Visualize your success. Avoid thoughts that produce self-doubt. Practice controlled breathing, meditation, biofeedback, and other strategies to help you relax and redirect your thoughts when they turn negative. It is best to practice some type of relaxation technique every day, regardless of whether you have a performance, so that the skill is there for you when you need it. Take a walk, jump up and down, shake out your muscles, or do whatever feels right to ease your anxious feelings before the performance. Connect with your audience -- smile, make eye contact, and think of them as friends. Act natural and be yourself. Exercise, eat a healthy diet, get adequate sleep, and live a healthy lifestyle. Keep in mind that stage fright is usually worse before the performance and often goes away once you get started. There are also mental tricks you can play to help you perform with less anxiety. These include: Focus on the friendliest faces in the audience. Laugh when you can, it can help you relax. Make yourself look good. When you look good, you feel good. These tips should help reduce performance anxiety. But if they don't, talk to a counselor or therapist trained in treating anxiety issues. You may benefit from more intensive therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, to help overcome performance anxiety. In addition, beta-blockers such as propranolol that lower the heart rate and block the effects of adrenaline are sometimes used by people with performance anxiety.

When should you call the doctor about sinusitis symptoms?,MASH,"""Acute and chronic sinusitis have similar symptoms: Facial pressure and pain Thick discolored mucus Congestion"" and ""call your doctor if you've had sinus symptoms for more than a few days or if they're really bad"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Sinusitis is common. But many people who have it use treatments that aren't likely to help. So before you run to the drugstore, you'll want to be sure you know how to handle this condition. The sinuses are small cavities in the skull that are normally filled with air. They make mucus, which helps keep the nasal passages clear of allergens and pollutants. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the tissue that lines these cavities. In some cases, this swelling blocks off the sinuses, trapping mucus and air inside them. This can cause pain and pressure. Sometimes, it can lead to a bacterial infection. Do you know the two types of sinusitis? Acute sinusitis lasts up to 4 weeks. Chronic sinusitis lasts at least several weeks and can linger for years. Its cause can be hard to pin down -- and hard to treat. Sinusitis might start because of a cold or allergies. Fungus can cause it for people who have weak immune systems. Sometimes, chronic sinusitis is due to problems with the structure of the nasal passages, or a growth such as a nasal polyp that keeps the sinuses from draining normally. Acute and chronic sinusitis have similar symptoms: Facial pressure and pain Thick discolored mucus Congestion The key is to figure out the cause. For instance, if your sinusitis is due to allergies, then decongestants alone will probably not help much. If you have symptoms for more than a couple of days, check in with your doctor. With a good exam -- and sometimes imaging tests, like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs -- you may be able to figure out exactly what's causing the problem. Often, the best sinusitis treatment is a combination of different approaches -- typically medication plus self-care. Antibiotics . If your doctor thinks a bacterial infection is to blame, he may prescribe antibiotics. For acute sinusitis, you typically take them for 10-14 days. For chronic sinusitis, it might be longer. Antibiotics only help with bacterial infections. They won't help if your sinusitis is caused by viruses or other problems. Some studies suggest that bacteria cause very few cases of the condition and that antibiotics are widely overused. Painkillers. Many people with sinusitis take over-the-counter ( OTC) pain medicines, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to ease discomfort. Follow the instructions on the label, and don't take them for more than 10 days. Check with your doctor to see which one is right for you. Decongestants . These meds lower the amount of mucus in the sinuses. Some are available as nasal sprays. Others are pills. If you use decongestant nasal sprays for more than 3 days, they may actually make you more congested. Follow the instructions on the label. Allergy medicines. Many cases of sinusitis are due to uncontrolled allergies. If you've never been diagnosed with allergies, it might be worth doing some allergy testing to see if you have them. If you do, medication (like antihistamines) and avoiding your triggers will help. Another option is to get allergy shots, a long-term treatment that gradually makes you less sensitive to the things that set off your symptoms. Steroids. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe inhaled steroids to bring down the swelling in the sinus membranes. For tough cases of chronic sinusitis, you may need to take steroids by mouth. Surgery. Occasionally, if you have chronic sinusitis or acute sinusitis that keeps coming back, an operation may be the best choice. The surgeon can remove blockages and enlarge the sinus passages, which makes it easier for them to drain. While medicines can help, many cases of sinusitis go away on their own without any medical treatment. If you often get the condition, many of these same approaches will help you prevent it, too. Humidify. Use a humidifier in rooms where you spend a lot of time. Follow the instructions for regular cleaning. Breathe in steam vapors. You can either run the shower and sit in the bathroom, or breathe in steam from a bowl of warm (but not too hot) water. The steam vapors ease congested and swollen nasal passages. Use warm heat. Put a warm, wet towel on your face. It can take off some of the pressure. Try a nasal saline solution. While they don't contain medicine (saline is salt water), they can help keep your nasal passages moist. Flush out your sinuses. Nasal irrigation with salt water can clear out mucus (and other debris) and keep your sinuses moist. You can use bulb syringes or neti pots, for example. Use distilled, sterile, or previously boiled water to make up the irrigation solution. Rinse the device after each use and let it air dry. Drink lots of fluids. They'll help thin the mucus, which reduces the blockage in your sinuses. Cut down on alcohol, which makes the swelling worse. Rest. When you've got a sinus infection, take it easier than normal. Get plenty of sleep and give your body a chance to recover. Home treatments may do the trick for some people. But call your doctor if you've had sinus symptoms for more than a few days or if they're really bad.

But many people who have it use treatments that aren't likely to help. So before you run to the drugstore, you'll want to be sure you know how to handle this condition. The sinuses are small cavities in the skull that are normally filled with air. They make mucus, which helps keep the nasal passages clear of allergens and pollutants. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the tissue that lines these cavities. In some cases, this swelling blocks off the sinuses, trapping mucus and air inside them. This can cause pain and pressure. Sometimes, it can lead to a bacterial infection. Do you know the two types of sinusitis? Acute sinusitis lasts up to 4 weeks. Chronic sinusitis lasts at least several weeks and can linger for years. Its cause can be hard to pin down -- and hard to treat. Sinusitis might start because of a cold or allergies. Fungus can cause it for people who have weak immune systems. Sometimes, chronic sinusitis is due to problems with the structure of the nasal passages, or a growth such as a nasal polyp that keeps the sinuses from draining normally. Acute and chronic sinusitis have similar symptoms: Facial pressure and pain Thick discolored mucus Congestion The key is to figure out the cause. For instance, if your sinusitis is due to allergies, then decongestants alone will probably not help much. If you have symptoms for more than a couple of days, check in with your doctor. With a good exam -- and sometimes imaging tests, like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs -- you may be able to figure out exactly what's causing the problem. Often, the best sinusitis treatment is a combination of different approaches -- typically medication plus self-care. Antibiotics . If your doctor thinks a bacterial infection is to blame, he may prescribe antibiotics. For acute sinusitis, you typically take them for 10-14 days. For chronic sinusitis, it might be longer. Antibiotics only help with bacterial infections. They won't help if your sinusitis is caused by viruses or other problems. Some studies suggest that bacteria cause very few cases of the condition and that antibiotics are widely overused. Painkillers. Many people with sinusitis take over-the-counter ( OTC) pain medicines, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to ease discomfort. Follow the instructions on the label, and don't take them for more than 10 days. Check with your doctor to see which one is right for you. Decongestants . These meds lower the amount of mucus in the sinuses. Some are available as nasal sprays. Others are pills. If you use decongestant nasal sprays for more than 3 days, they may actually make you more congested. Follow the instructions on the label. Allergy medicines. Many cases of sinusitis are due to uncontrolled allergies. If you've never been diagnosed with allergies, it might be worth doing some allergy testing to see if you have them. If you do, medication (like antihistamines) and avoiding your triggers will help. Another option is to get allergy shots, a long-term treatment that gradually makes you less sensitive to the things that set off your symptoms. Steroids. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe inhaled steroids to bring down the swelling in the sinus membranes. For tough cases of chronic sinusitis, you may need to take steroids by mouth. Surgery. Occasionally, if you have chronic sinusitis or acute sinusitis that keeps coming back, an operation may be the best choice. The surgeon can remove blockages and enlarge the sinus passages, which makes it easier for them to drain. While medicines can help, many cases of sinusitis go away on their own without any medical treatment. If you often get the condition, many of these same approaches will help you prevent it, too. Humidify. Use a humidifier in rooms where you spend a lot of time. Follow the instructions for regular cleaning. Breathe in steam vapors. You can either run the shower and sit in the bathroom, or breathe in steam from a bowl of warm (but not too hot) water. The steam vapors ease congested and swollen nasal passages. Use warm heat. Put a warm, wet towel on your face. It can take off some of the pressure. Try a nasal saline solution. While they don't contain medicine (saline is salt water), they can help keep your nasal passages moist. Flush out your sinuses. Nasal irrigation with salt water can clear out mucus (and other debris) and keep your sinuses moist. You can use bulb syringes or neti pots, for example. Use distilled, sterile, or previously boiled water to make up the irrigation solution. Rinse the device after each use and let it air dry. Drink lots of fluids. They'll help thin the mucus, which reduces the blockage in your sinuses. Cut down on alcohol, which makes the swelling worse. Rest. When you've got a sinus infection, take it easier than normal. Get plenty of sleep and give your body a chance to recover. Home treatments may do the trick for some people.

Should I get allergy shots if I have asthma?,MASH,"""You can train your immune system to not overreact to allergy triggers. Doctors do this by giving you allergy shots (immunotherapy) for asthma. An allergy shot is a small amount of the substance that causes your allergy. By giving repeated shots of the substance over a period of time, your immune system eventually stops causing the allergic reaction. Ask your doctor if you are a candidate for allergy shots for preventing asthma"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Asthma attacks (worsening of asthma symptoms) can be triggered by allergies, which can temporarily increase the inflammation of the airways in a susceptible person. An allergy is the immune system's reaction when exposed to what is otherwise a harmless substance, such as plant pollen, mold, or animal hair, skin or saliva. The immune system acts as a body defense, yet for people with allergies, the immune system treats these substances, called 'allergens,' as if they are harmful, causing a disruption to normal body functions. Allergens are what trigger a series of reactions by the immune system during an allergic reaction. Inhaled Allergens. The most important allergens for people with allergic asthma appear to be those asthma triggers that are inhaled. Hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs when a person comes in contact with an allergen or a substance that he or she is sensitive to. Common inhaled allergens include: Animal dander (skin, saliva) Dust mites Cockroach particles Mold Pollen Medical experts recommend that all people with allergies and asthma try to identify possible inhaled allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms. Food Allergies. Food allergies rarely cause asthma yet they can cause a severe life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. The condition can lead to symptoms that include difficulty breathing, wheezing, an itchy rash, low blood pressure, and vomiting. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, walnuts) Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Food preservatives can also trigger allergic and asthmatic reactions. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and may be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods If you suspect that certain foods may be the cause of your asthma, discuss this with your doctor. Allergy skin testing can be done to determine if you are allergic to these foods. If you have allergies and asthma, avoid the substance you are allergic to. Here are some tips to help you avoid some of the most common allergens and prevent asthma attack symptoms. Dust Mites Encase pillows, mattresses, and box springs with allergen-proof, zippered covers. Wash all bedding in hot water once a week. Non-carpeted flooring is best. If you cannot get rid of your carpeting, vacuum often with an HEPA filter. Wear a mask while vacuuming. If your child has asthma, do not vacuum while he or she is in the room. Products that eliminate dust mites from carpeting (such as Acarosan) can be purchased. Your asthma care provider can give you information about these products. Avoid curtains and drapes. Use plain window shades instead of mini-blinds. Washable curtains should be washed in hot water every two to four weeks. Dust all surfaces with a damp cloth often, including lampshades and windowsills. Keep clutter under control. Toys and books should be stored in enclosed bookshelves, drawers or closets. Replace traditional stuffed animals with washable stuffed animals. Keep all clothing in drawers and closets. Keep drawers and closets closed. Cover air ducts with filters. Change these when soiled. Pillows and bedding should not contain feathers. Keep indoor humidity low (below 50%). Use a dehumidifier if needed. Regularly change filters on heaters and air conditioners. Mold and Mildew Air out damp, humid areas frequently. Run a dehumidifier to keep humidity between 35% and 45%. Use air conditioners when possible. Clean bathrooms regularly using products that kill and prevent mold. Use exhaust fans to vent steam. Do not carpet the bathroom. Keep indoor plants out of bedrooms. When painting, add mold inhibitor to paint to prevent mold from growing. Avoid sources of outdoor molds, such as wet leaves or garden debris. To clean visible mold use a cleaning solution containing bleach ( one ounce per quart of water). Insects Many homes and apartments have cockroaches and other insects. Some people with asthma are allergic to a protein in their droppings. To control these allergens in your home: Use roach baits or traps. Insect sprays can be used, but should only be sprayed when no one is at home. Before you or your child returns home after spraying, make sure that your home has been aired out for a couple of hours. Because cockroaches thrive in high humid environment, fix water leaks in and around your home. Cover food in lidded or sealed containers. Clean dishes after eating. Sweep floors after you have eaten. Pollen Pollen is a tiny egg shaped cell from flowering plants. Pollens are difficult to avoid because they cannot be eliminated from the atmosphere. Plants have different periods of pollination, which varies little from year to year. Yet, the type of weather affects the amount of pollen in the air with hot, dry, and windy weather causing more pollen in the air. In general pollen season starts from February to October. You can lessen your or your child's exposure to pollen by: Limiting your or your child's outdoor activities during times of high pollen, such as early morning. Having him wear a hat outdoors, washing his hands and face when he comes inside, and having him change his clothes after being outside. Staying indoors during dry or windy days when pollen counts are high. Keeping windows closed during pollen seasons. Using air conditioning if possible. Pet Dander It is best not to own any pets if you or your child is highly allergic to pet dander. Long visits to friends and family who own pets should be avoided. If you do visit, make sure you or your child takes asthma or allergy medicines before the visit. Exposure to the pets should be kept to a minimum when visiting. If you must have a cat or dog in the home, restrict its living area. It should not be allowed in your or your child's bedroom at any time. If possible, keep the pet outside. Wash your pet weekly. Remove as much carpeting as possible. Animal dander deposits in the carpet and stays there, even after the pet is gone from the home.

However, a sore throat from a cold often gets better or goes away after the first day or two. Other cold symptoms such as a runny nose and congestion may follow the sore throat. Strep throat, which is an infection due to streptococcus bacteria, is another cause of sore throats and tonsillitis. With strep throat, the sore throat is often more severe and persists. Tonsillitis is a painful inflammation or infection of the tonsils, the tissue masses located at the back of the throat. Sore throats can be caused by viruses or bacteria. The most common causes of sore throats are viruses. Viral sore throats are often accompanied by other cold symptoms that may include a runny nose, cough, red or watery eyes, and sneezing. Other causes of sore throat include smoking, pollution or irritants in the air, allergies, and dry air. In addition to a sore throat, other common cold symptoms include: Runny nose Sneezing Cough Mild headache Mild body aches Fever Although there is no cure for a sore throat caused by a cold virus, there are ways to help you feel more comfortable. Drinking warm liquids, gargling with warm salt water, sucking on ice chips, or taking an over-the-counter medicine may relieve symptoms of pain or fever. When you are sick with a cold, it is also important to get enough rest, eat a healthy diet, and drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter cold medications may relieve cold and sore throat symptoms. However, the benefits of these drugs are minimal. Some cold medications include: Pain relievers, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen and naproxen, to relieve the aches and pains of a cold and sore throat. ( Aspirin should not be given to children because of its link to Reye's syndrome, a disorder that can cause brain damage and death.) Sore throat sprays and lozenges to soothe your throat and numb the throat pain temporarily. ( Lozenges should not be given to young children.) Decongestant nasal sprays to relieve a sore throat caused by postnasal drip -- nasal drainage that runs down your throat. ( Be sure to stop using nasal decongestant sprays after three days, or you may have an increase in congestion when you stop them.) Antibiotics should not be used to treat a cold virus and sore throat. Antibiotics are effective only against bacteria. They will not work on sore throats associated with colds, which are caused by viruses. Strep throat is caused by an infection of streptococcus bacteria. Strep throat spreads by having contact with an infected person's saliva or nasal secretions. Although strep throat is more common in children ages 5 to 15, it also occurs in adults. To diagnose strep throat, your doctor can check a rapid strep test or send a throat swab to the lab for a culture. In some cases, he or she may be able to diagnose strep based on your reported symptoms and other signs, such as white spots in the throat area, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Strep throat can cause more serious illnesses, such as rheumatic fever, a disease that may harm the heart valves. That's why it's important to get proper medical treatment. With proper treatment, strep throat is usually cured within 10 days. Strep throat symptoms are usually more severe than symptoms of a sore throat with a cold and may include the following: Sudden sore throat Loss of appetite Painful swallowing Red tonsils with white spots Fever The symptoms of a cold and strep throat can be very similar. If you think you have symptoms of strep throat, visit your health care provider. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and do a physical exam, and you may be given a strep test. A rapid strep test checks for streptococcus bacteria infection in the throat. The test is painless and takes very little time. The tip of a cotton swab is used to wipe the back of the throat. The swab is then tested right away. If the strep test is positive, you have strep throat. If the strep test is negative, you likely do not have strep throat. However, if there are strong signs of strep throat, your health care provider can do a different throat swab test that is sent to the lab to see if strep bacteria can be grown (cultured) from it. A throat culture takes a couple of days for results. Strep throat is treated using antibiotics, which kill the bacteria causing the infection. Antibiotics are often taken as pills or given as a shot. Penicillin and amoxicillin are common antibiotics used to treat strep throat. Other antibiotics are prescribed for people who are allergic to penicillin. Follow your health care provider's instructions for antibiotic use. Take all of the medication, even if you feel better. You should feel better within a day or two. A person with strep throat should stay home until 24 hours after starting the antibiotic. If your strep throat is not getting better, let your health care provider know right away. Do not stop taking your prescribedmedicine unless your health care provider tells you to. Call your health care provider if these symptoms occur: Fever one or two days after feeling better Nausea or vomiting Earache Headache Neck stiffness Skin rash Cough Swollen glands Painful joints Shortness of breath Dark urine, rash, or chest pain (may occur three to four weeks later) Sometimes, a sore throat is caused by tonsillitis, an inflammation of the tonsils. Tonsillitis can be caused by viruses or bacteria. While the tonsils' job is to help fight infection, the tonsils can also become infected. When they do, the result is tonsillitis and a very painful sore throat. In addition to a sore throat, a cold usually causes nasal symptoms, such as runny nose or congestion. With tonsillitis, your tonsils become swollen and may have telltale white or yellow spots. Other symptoms with tonsillitis include the following: Bad breath Fever Voice changes because of swelling Painful swallowing Swollen lymph glands in neck If the tonsillitis infection is bacterial like strep throat, then antibiotics are given. If the tonsillitis infection is viral, antibiotics will not help. The virus must run its course for the sore throat to resolve. For either type of throat infection, the following treatment measures may help: Getting plenty of rest Drinking lots of fluid Eating smooth, soothing foods like gelatin, ice cream, shakes, frozen desserts, and soup Avoiding crunchy or spicy foods Using a vaporizer Taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen, naproxen, or ibuprofen. Children should not take aspirin. If the tonsillitis infections occur repeatedly, or if the tonsils are interfering with sleep and breathing, the doctor may recommend a tonsillectomy, which is the surgical removal of the tonsils.</p>",2025-11-25 04:40:45-08:00,False,Response is valid.

How do you recover from cervical disc surgery?,MASH,"""The fusion can take anywhere from three months to a year to become solid after surgery, and you could still have some symptoms during that time. Your doctor might recommend that you wear a cervical collar to support your neck for the first four to six weeks. You may help speed the process by eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and practicing good posture. Check with your surgeon to see what activity level is right for you before starting any exercise after surgery.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The vast majority of people -- more than 90% -- with pain from cervical disc disease will get better on their own over time with simple, conservative treatments. Surgery, however, may help if other treatments fail or if symptoms worsen. Cervical disc disease is caused by an abnormality in one or more discs -- the cushions -- that lie between the neck bones (vertebrae). When a disc is damaged -- due to arthritis or an unknown cause -- it can lead to neck pain from inflammation or muscle spasm. In severe cases, pain and numbness can occur in the arms from pressure on the cervical nerve roots. Surgery for cervical disc disease typically involves removing the disc that is pinching the nerve or pressing on the spinal cord. This surgery is called a discectomy. Depending on where the disc is located, the surgeon can remove it through a small incision either in the front (anterior discectomy) or back (posterior discectomy) of the neck while you are under anesthesia. A similar technique, microdiscectomy, removes the disc through a smaller incision using a microscope or other magnifying device. Often, a procedure is performed to close the space that's left when the disc is removed and restore the spine to its original length. Patients have two options: Artificial cervical disc replacement Cervical fusion In 2007, the FDA approved the first artificial disc, the Prestige Cervical disc, which looks and moves much like the real thing but is made of metal. Since then, several artificial cervical discs have been developed and approved. Ongoing research has shown that the artificial disc can improve neck and arm pain as safely and effectively as cervical fusion while allowing for range of motion that is as good or better than with cervical fusion. People who get the artificial disc are often able to return to work more quickly as well. The surgery to replace the disc, however, does take longer and can lead to more blood loss than with cervical fusion. It's also not known how the artificial discs will last over time. People who get an artificial disc can always opt for cervical fusion later. But if a patient has cervical fusion first, it's not possible to later put an artificial disc in the same spot. Not everyone is a candidate for the artificial disc, however. Those with osteoporosis, joint disease, infection, inflammation at the site, or an allergy to stainless steel may not be candidates for disc replacement surgery. With cervical fusion surgery, the surgeon removes the damaged disc and places a bone graft (which is taken either from the patient's hip or from a cadaver) in the space between the vertebrae. The bone graft will eventually fuse to the vertebrae above and below it. A metal plate may be screwed into the vertebrae above and below the graft to hold the bone in place while it heals and fuses with the vertebrae. Discectomy with cervical fusion can often help relieve the pain of spinal disc disease. The only caveat is that after the surgery, many people find that they lose some degree of movement in their neck. Although cervical disc surgery is generally safe, it does have a few risks, including: Infection Excessive bleeding Reaction to anesthesia Chronic neck pain Damage to the nerves, spinal cord, esophagus, or vocal cords Failure to heal After cervical fusion surgery, some people develop cervical disc problems above and/or below the previously affected disc. One study found that about 12% of the patients developed new cervical disease that required a second surgery over a 20 year period after the first surgery. It is not yet known if the artificial disc will cause this same problem. You'll likely be able to get up and move around within a few hours of your cervical disc surgery and then either go home from the hospital the same day or the following morning. You'll feel some pain in the area operated on, but it should ease over time.

Those with osteoporosis, joint disease, infection, inflammation at the site, or an allergy to stainless steel may not be candidates for disc replacement surgery. With cervical fusion surgery, the surgeon removes the damaged disc and places a bone graft (which is taken either from the patient's hip or from a cadaver) in the space between the vertebrae. The bone graft will eventually fuse to the vertebrae above and below it. A metal plate may be screwed into the vertebrae above and below the graft to hold the bone in place while it heals and fuses with the vertebrae. Discectomy with cervical fusion can often help relieve the pain of spinal disc disease. The only caveat is that after the surgery, many people find that they lose some degree of movement in their neck. Although cervical disc surgery is generally safe, it does have a few risks, including: Infection Excessive bleeding Reaction to anesthesia Chronic neck pain Damage to the nerves, spinal cord, esophagus, or vocal cords Failure to heal After cervical fusion surgery, some people develop cervical disc problems above and/or below the previously affected disc. One study found that about 12% of the patients developed new cervical disease that required a second surgery over a 20 year period after the first surgery. It is not yet known if the artificial disc will cause this same problem. You'll likely be able to get up and move around within a few hours of your cervical disc surgery and then either go home from the hospital the same day or the following morning. You'll feel some pain in the area operated on, but it should ease over time. The fusion can take anywhere from three months to a year to become solid after surgery, and you could still have some symptoms during that time. Your doctor might recommend that you wear a cervical collar to support your neck for the first four to six weeks. You may help speed the process by eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and practicing good posture. Check with your surgeon to see what activity level is right for you before starting any exercise after surgery.</p>",2025-11-25 04:31:57-08:00,False,Response is valid.
How do you know if you have ADHD?,MASH,"""The only way to know for sure is to see a doctor. That's because the disorder has a number of possible symptoms, and they can easily be confused with those of other conditions, like depression or anxiety.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Has anyone ever asked you if you have ADHD? Maybe you've even wondered yourself. The only way to know for sure is to see a doctor. That's because the disorder has a number of possible symptoms, and they can easily be confused with those of other conditions, like depression or anxiety. Not sure whether you should get checked by a doc? If many of these apply, you may need to get checked out. 1. People say you're forgetful. Everyone misplaces car keys or jackets once in a while. But this kind of thing happens often when you have ADHD. You might spend time looking for glasses, wallets, phones, and other items every day. You may also forget to return phone calls, space out on paying bills, or miss medical appointments. 2. People complain that you don't listen. Most of us lose focus on a conversation once in a while, especially if there's a TV nearby or something else grabs our attention. This happens often and to a greater degree with ADHD, even when there are no distractions around. But still, ADHD is more than that. 3. You're often late. Time management is an ongoing challenge when you have ADHD. It often leads to missed deadlines or appointments unless you work on avoiding that. 4. You have trouble concentrating. Problems with attention, especially focusing for long periods of time or paying attention to details, is one of the hallmarks of the condition. Depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders can also take a toll on your focus, and many people with ADHD have one or more of these issues, too. Your doctor can ask you questions to get to the bottom of what's causing your attention problems. 5. You leave things undone. Problems with attention and memory can make it tough to start or finish projects, especially ones that you know will take a lot of focus to complete. This symptom can point to depression, too. 6. You had behavior issues as a child. You need to have had attention and concentration problems as a child in order to be diagnosed with ADHD as an adult -- even if those early symptoms didn't come with a formal diagnosis. People may have accused you of being lazy back in childhood. Or they may have thought you had another condition like depression or anxiety. If you actually were diagnosed with the disorder as a child, you may still have it. The symptoms change as you age, and not everyone outgrows it. 7. You lack impulse control. This is more than tossing a candy bar into your cart at the checkout line. This is doing something even though you know it could have serious consequences, like running a red light because you think you can get away with it or not being able to keep quiet when you have something to say, even though you know you should. 8. You can't get organized. You may notice this more at work. You could have trouble setting priorities, following through on tasks, and meeting project deadlines. 9. You're fidgety. Kids with ADHD are often hyperactive, but adults are more likely to be fidgety or restless. You might also talk too much and interrupt others. 10. You can't control your emotions. You might be moody or irritable, express frustration often, feel unmotivated, or be prone to angry outbursts. ADHD can make it hard to manage uncomfortable emotions or follow appropriate behavior when you're upset. There's no one test. Instead, doctors and psychologists get information about what and how many symptoms you have, when they started, how long they've lasted, and how severe they are. In order to be diagnosed with ADHD, you need to have several symptoms, not just one or two. And they have to have affected your jobs, relationships, or other important areas of your life. Your doctor will also want to rule out other conditions or find out if you have more than one disorder. Several treatments can help you manage the condition. So if you answered yes to a lot of these questions, consider making an appointment with your doctor.

Can I wear contacts with glaucoma?,MASH,"""Whether or not you can wear contact lenses depends on which glaucoma treatment your doctor selects for you.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> There is nothing that will prevent glaucoma, but you can slow down its development with early treatment. Therefore, it is very important that you have regular eye exams. Your doctor will perform a series of painless tests -- eye pressure measurements, dilated eye exams, and sometimes visual field testing and other tests -- to check for any changes in your eye or in your vision. With early detection, glaucoma can often be controlled with medications, such as eye drops. If your glaucoma doesn't respond to medication, your doctor may also recommend surgery. Remember, because glaucoma is painless, about half of people who have it don't know they have it. You can't get your vision back once it is lost. Your best protection is to get regular eye exams, every couple of years if you are over 40 or on a schedule recommended by your doctor. The chances are good that you will not go blind if you take your medication correctly and regularly and follow up with your doctor. Treatment significantly slows the damage that occurs to the optic nerve because of the high pressure in the eye. In fact, if you take your eye drops on schedule each day, you'll probably keep your eyesight until the day you die of old age! Not necessarily, but it does increase your risk. Other factors that may increase your risk are: Being over age 50 Being over age 40 and African- American Having a family history of glaucoma Having a history of serious eye injury Taking steroid medications Having diabetes Being nearsighted Having high blood pressure People with these risk factors should have their eyes examined on a regular basis to look for the disease. Yes. There are many different types of medications (in eye drops or pills) that are used to treat glaucoma. Typically, the doctor will start you on an eye drop formula. The medications work two ways: Some decrease how much fluid is produced in the eye; others help the fluid flow out better. Many people can preserve their vision if they take their medications as scheduled and visit their doctor regularly. Note: Medications for glaucoma -- even eye drops -- can affect the entire body, so you should alert all of your doctors that you are taking them, as well as report all of your medical conditions to your eye doctor. In some people, however, drugs alone do not control the eye pressure, and surgery is needed. One type of surgery called laser trabeculoplasty uses a laser to improve the flow of fluids out of the eye. This can be done in your doctor's office. There are also several conventional surgeries -- the most common is called trabeculectomy -- in which your doctor creates a new drainage path in the eye under the eyelid. This surgery must be done in an operating room. After both of these procedures, people may still have to take eye drops to further lower the eye pressure. Studies performed in the 1970s reported that smoking marijuana could lower eye pressure. Other studies have been inconclusive. Newer reviews by the National Eye Institute and the Institute of Medicine show that there is no scientific evidence that marijuana is more effective than the drugs currently available. Most people with glaucoma can still drive -- as long as they pass the Department of Motor Vehicles' vision test. Simply put, your ability to drive will depend on how much vision has been lost. Some people with advanced glaucoma can still get their license renewed but with restrictions. Ask your doctor to discuss your condition with you to determine if driving will be a concern for you. Whether or not you can wear contact lenses depends on which glaucoma treatment your doctor selects for you. You should be able to continue wearing them if you use eye drops. However, some drugs may need to be taken when lenses are not in your eyes. Also, some of the older medications can affect your prescription, so you may need to get new contacts at some point. If your doctor decides that you need surgery, your ability to wear contacts may be affected. Be sure to discuss your contacts with your doctor so together the two of you can manage your vision concerns and your medication concerns. Being diagnosed with glaucoma is scary. Many older people are dealing with several problems that come with age. They often worry that they will become a burden to the family if they lose their vision. So, first, reassure your parent that many people keep their vision with proper medication and care. Next, help your loved one establish a routine so eye drops are applied correctly on schedule. Some eye drops must be applied several times a day. This can be especially difficult for people with arthritis, and, frankly, not an easy task for anyone to remember! You could offer to help, perhaps by swinging by the house or by calling with a reminder. If that's not possible, talk with your parent's doctor to make sure a plan is in place. Compliance with drop regimens is extremely important in glaucoma to prevent permanent vision loss. If your parent faces surgery, do what you can to help him or her prepare, then arrange transportation to follow-up visits to the doctor. There are many services and products available to help someone with impaired vision continue to write checks, organize their kitchen, tell time, and even play cards.

Who should I call if I have problems with my dentures?,MASH,"""If you notice changes to the way your dentures fit or any other mouth problems, see your dentist right away.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Dentures can be an important solution to tooth loss. Today's dentures, also called false teeth, are not like the ones your grandmother wore. They are more comfortable and natural looking than they were in the past. Still, if you don't take proper care of your dentures, problems can occur. Web MD takes a look at common denture problems and how they can be treated or prevented. If you wear dentures, it is very important you keep your mouth clean and healthy. You should also only wear dentures that fit properly. Otherwise, the following problems may occur: Gum and mouth irritation Problems eating and speaking Dentures that move around in your mouth Mouth infections If you have problems with your dentures, see your dentist right away. Your dentures may need to be adjusted or replaced. Here are some ways to treat various denture problems: Make sure your dentures fit. Over time, your gums and bones will change and your dentures won't fit as well. When this happens, your dentures need to be adjusted, modified, or replaced by your dentist. Never try to adjust your dentures yourself. Speak slowly. When you first get dentures, it may be hard for you to say certain words. Be patient. Practice saying the challenging words aloud and speak slowly. If your dentures move around when you laugh or smile, gently bite down and swallow to put them back in place. Check with your dentist to adjust the fit. Eat soft foods. If you are having trouble eating, follow these tips: Take small bites of soft foods, such as eggs and yogurt. Don't eat anything sticky. Chew your food slowly. When you chew, use both sides of your mouth at the same time. This prevents your dentures from moving forward or tipping. Eating will become easier as you get used to your dentures. In time, you should be able to eat most foods. Use an adhesive. Denture adhesives help your dentures stay in place and make them feel more secure. But denture adhesives should not be used to fix old or poorly fitting dentures - and should generally be avoided. When using an adhesive, follow the instructions carefully. Use only a small amount. Some people who wear dentures get mouth infections, such as: Cheilitis. This is a painful infection that causes inflammation and cracking at the corners of your mouth. It is caused by an overgrowth of yeast. Yeast can accumulate in moist areas of your mouth if your dentures don't fit properly. To prevent cheilitis (also called cheilosis), see your dentist regularly to make sure your dentures fit properly. Also, try not to rub or lick the corners of your mouth. Stomatitis . This is another infection that is caused by too much yeast. You may not know you have denture-induced stomatitis, because symptoms are not always obvious. When symptoms are noticeable, you may see small red bumps on the roof of your mouth or general mouth redness, especially under your upper dentures. Both cheilitis and stomatitis can be treated with medicine and proper denture care. Along with making sure they fit well, it is important to take good care of your dentures. Here are some tips to keep your dentures working and looking their best: Never sleep with your dentures. Unless your dentist advises you to do so for a specific time, such as after multiple extractions and initial delivery of new dentures, do not sleep with your dentures. Handle dentures with care.

Your dentures may need to be adjusted or replaced.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Dentures can be an important solution to tooth loss. Today's dentures, also called false teeth, are not like the ones your grandmother wore. They are more comfortable and natural looking than they were in the past. Still, if you don't take proper care of your dentures, problems can occur. Web MD takes a look at common denture problems and how they can be treated or prevented. If you wear dentures, it is very important you keep your mouth clean and healthy. You should also only wear dentures that fit properly. Otherwise, the following problems may occur: Gum and mouth irritation Problems eating and speaking Dentures that move around in your mouth Mouth infections If you have problems with your dentures, see your dentist right away. Your dentures may need to be adjusted or replaced. Here are some ways to treat various denture problems: Make sure your dentures fit. Over time, your gums and bones will change and your dentures won't fit as well. When this happens, your dentures need to be adjusted, modified, or replaced by your dentist. Never try to adjust your dentures yourself. Speak slowly. When you first get dentures, it may be hard for you to say certain words. Be patient. Practice saying the challenging words aloud and speak slowly. If your dentures move around when you laugh or smile, gently bite down and swallow to put them back in place. Check with your dentist to adjust the fit. Eat soft foods. If you are having trouble eating, follow these tips: Take small bites of soft foods, such as eggs and yogurt. Don't eat anything sticky. Chew your food slowly. When you chew, use both sides of your mouth at the same time. This prevents your dentures from moving forward or tipping. Eating will become easier as you get used to your dentures. In time, you should be able to eat most foods. Use an adhesive. Denture adhesives help your dentures stay in place and make them feel more secure. But denture adhesives should not be used to fix old or poorly fitting dentures - and should generally be avoided. When using an adhesive, follow the instructions carefully. Use only a small amount. Some people who wear dentures get mouth infections, such as: Cheilitis. This is a painful infection that causes inflammation and cracking at the corners of your mouth. It is caused by an overgrowth of yeast. Yeast can accumulate in moist areas of your mouth if your dentures don't fit properly. To prevent cheilitis (also called cheilosis), see your dentist regularly to make sure your dentures fit properly. Also, try not to rub or lick the corners of your mouth. Stomatitis . This is another infection that is caused by too much yeast. You may not know you have denture-induced stomatitis, because symptoms are not always obvious. When symptoms are noticeable, you may see small red bumps on the roof of your mouth or general mouth redness, especially under your upper dentures. Both cheilitis and stomatitis can be treated with medicine and proper denture care. Along with making sure they fit well, it is important to take good care of your dentures. Here are some tips to keep your dentures working and looking their best: Never sleep with your dentures. Unless your dentist advises you to do so for a specific time, such as after multiple extractions and initial delivery of new dentures, do not sleep with your dentures. Handle dentures with care.

When should I check my blood sugar if I have type 1 diabetes?,MASH,"""Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Type 1 diabetes happens when your immune system destroys cells in your pancreas called beta cells. They're the ones that make insulin. Some people get a condition called secondary diabetes. It's similar to type 1, except the immune system doesn't destroy your beta cells. They're wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body's tissues. Cells use it as fuel. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Glucose doesn't move into your cells because insulin isn't there to do it. Instead it builds up in your blood and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar, which can lead to: Dehydration. When there's extra sugar in your blood, you pee more. That's your body's way of getting rid of it. A large amount of water goes out with that urine, causing your body to dry out. Weight loss. The glucose that goes out when you pee takes calories with it. That's why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. Dehydration also plays a part. Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA). If your body can't get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body can't use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This combination of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as 'ketoacidosis' and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Damage to your body. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes, kidneys, and heart. They can also make you more likely to get hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. It's rare. Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. It's more common in whites than in African- Americans. It affects men and women equally. Although the disease usually starts in people under 20, it can happen at any age. Doctors don't know all the things that lead to type 1 diabetes. But they do know your genes play a role. They also know type 1 diabetes can result when something in the environment, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas. Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They're present in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases, like Grave's disease or vitiligo. These are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Heavy thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Nausea and vomiting Pain in your belly Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss (even though you're eating and feel hungry) Fatigue (weak, tired feeling) Blurred vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor will call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of the skin, urinary tract, or vagina Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Pain in your belly Loss of consciousness (rare) If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, he'll check your blood sugar levels. He may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don't have enough insulin. Right now there's no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Many people with type 1 diabetes live long, healthy lives. The key to good health is to keep your blood sugar levels within the range your doctor gives you. You'll need to check them often and adjust insulin, food, and activities to make that happen. All people with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, he'll mention three main things: ' Onset' is the length of time before it reaches your bloodstream and begins lowering blood sugar. ' Peak time' is the time when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering blood sugar. ' Duration' is how long it keeps working after onset. Several types of insulin are available. Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks around 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps working for 3 to 6 hours. Intermediate-acting won't get into your bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after injection. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours and works for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts for about 24 hours. Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two different types of insulin. You may progress to three or four shots a day. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end, and give yourself the shot. Some now comes in a prefilled pen. One kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump -- a device you wear that sends it into your body via a small tube. Your doctor will help you to pick the type and the delivery method that's best for you. Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn't as simple as going out for a run. You have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Knowledge is power. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you. Some things will make your levels go up; others won't. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to prevent it from dropping too low. If your test is high, test for ketones -- acids that can result from high sugar levels. If they're OK, you should be good to go. If they're high, skip the workout. You'll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started. If you don't keep your type 1 diabetes well controlled, you could set yourself up for serious or life-threatening problems: Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. It's rare before puberty no matter how long you've had the disease. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Kidney damage. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chances grow over time. It's most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems like kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood circulation and nerve damage. Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of sensation in and a lack of blood supply to your feet. This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. And when that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>",2025-11-25 04:47:30-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Here are some things you may discuss before becoming pregnant: Medications for Crohn's don't usually affect a woman's chance of becoming pregnant. But some treatments -- such as sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) -- can affect a man's fertility. So men with Crohn's who hope to become fathers should talk to their doctors about changing medication. If you take methotrexate, your doctor will suggest you stop before your pregnancy. The drug can harm the baby. Men, too, should stop taking the drug several months before conception. If you are taking steroids, your doctor may suggest you wait to become pregnant. If you've had surgery for Crohn's you can still have a healthy pregnancy, but it may be harder to get pregnant. If you are thinking about having surgery, talk to your doctor. You may want to put off surgery until after your pregnancy. When you're pregnant, have regular visits with both your OB- GYN and your gastroenterologist to monitor your baby's health and your Crohn's. You should see a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine, because pregnancy with Crohn's is considered high risk. Some women say their Crohn's symptoms actually improve when they're pregnant and they have fewer flares. Make sure your doctors are aware of all the medications you are taking. If you're on a drug treatment plan that works for you, they may suggest you stay on it, but they may also suggest some changes to keep you and your baby safe. Tell your doctor if you take steroids, immunosuppressives, biologics, or even antibiotics, or anti-diarrhea drugs. You'll need to stop certain types of these drugs. Some medications, like sulfasalazine and other drugs in the aminosalicylate class, are considered safe while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. If you are thinking of becoming pregnant, you should consider adding folic acid supplements to your diet even before conception. These supplements will be needed throughout your pregnancy. You may need tests to monitor your Crohn's while you're pregnant. Some are OK, but there are other tests you may want to put off until after your baby is born. Your doctor can guide you on this decision. Ultrasounds, MRIs, and fetal monitoring devices are considered safe. If you are on steroids or have moderate to severe flares while pregnant, you may have frequent ultrasounds to check on your baby's growth. X-rays and CT scans may be necessary during pregnancy. To limit radiation exposure, abdominal shielding can be used. It's considered safe to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy, where a tube with a camera is placed in your colon to look for any problems. It is probably not a good idea to have a colonoscopy. The tests take a long time and patients usually get drugs to put them to sleep. You should also avoid X-rays and CT scans if possible. The radiation isn't good for a developing baby. Discuss your labor and delivery plans with your doctor well before your due date. If you have fistulas, abnormal passageways between organs, or other areas around your vagina or rectum that have been affected by Crohn's, your doctor may recommend you have a C-section. If you plan to breastfeed, talk to your doctor about your medications and if they're safe for your new baby. Breastfeeding shouldn't make your Crohn's worse, and it offers many health benefits to you and your baby.</p>",2025-11-25 01:57:31-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Will I have to try several medications before my child's ADHD symptoms disappear?,MASH,"""Sometimes, a doctor must prescribe different medications or different dosages before finding the best treatment for a child.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and the inability to control impulses. It affects an estimated 5.2 million school-age children in the U. S. Everyone, especially younger children, may have symptoms of ADHD from time to time. But with ADHD, the ability to function with daily activities is affected. A diagnosis of ADHD can be hard to make, and evaluation must be made by a specialist. There are several different approaches to treating ADHD. But research suggests that for many children, the best way to manage the symptoms is a multimodal approach. Multimodal treatment involves multiple methods of treatment that work together to help a child with ADHD. The main components of this approach are medications, behavioral therapy, and education. The most commonly prescribed medications for ADHD are stimulants. These include: Amphetamine ( Adzenys XR- ODT) Amphetamine/ Dextroamphetamine ( Adderall, Adderall XR) Dexmethylphenidate ( Focalin, Focalin XR) Dextroamphetamine ( Dexedrine or Dextrostat) Lisdexamfetamine ( Vyvanse) Methylphenidate ( Concerta, Daytrana, Metadate, Methylin, Quillivant XR, Ritalin) Some of these drugs may be available in longer-acting formulations. Non-stimulant medications used to treat ADHD, include: Atomoxetine ( Strattera) Clonidine ER ( Kapvay) Guanfacine ER ( Intuniv) ADHD medications are used to improve children's ability to concentrate and work. Sometimes, a doctor must prescribe different medications or different dosages before finding the best treatment for a child. Doctors and parents need to carefully monitor children taking medications for ADHD. Side effects of ADHD medicines can include: Anxiety Decreased appetite Fatigue Irritability Sleeping difficulties Skin discoloration (with patches) Upset stomach Most side effects are minor and improve with time. In some cases, doctors may lower a medication dosage to relieve side effects. The FDA recommends that a thorough medical history and exam, including an evaluation of underlying heart or psychiatric problems, be done as part of an ADHD treatment plan. A higher risk of strokes, heart attacks, and sudden death among patients with existing heart conditions has been linked to use of ADHD medications. An increased risk of psychiatric problems has also been linked to ADHD medications. The FDA has recently given approval to a device called Monach external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (e TNS) System to treat chilren age 7 to 12 years old. the cell phone-sized device delivers mild stimulation to electrodes which are attached to a patch worn on the oatient's forehead. Those electrical pulses interact with the part of the brain which is believed to be responsible for ADHD. Behavioral therapy is designed to help a child curb problematic behaviors. This may involve helping the child learn to organize time and activities. Or it could help a child complete homework. It may also involve helping the child control his or her impulses and responses to emotional stimuli. Educating parents about the disorder and its management is another important part of ADHD treatment. For parents, this may include learning parenting skills to help the child manage his or her behavior. That would involve skills such as giving positive feedback for desirable behaviors, ignoring undesirable behaviors, and giving time-outs when the child's behavior is out of control. In some cases, the child's entire family may be involved in this part of the treatment. Treatment guidelines call for behavior therapy as the preferred treatment for preschool children with ADHD. Medicine may be prescribed if further treatment is needed. For older children with ADHD, age 6 and older, an approach that includes both behavior therapy and medication is preferred. Researchers have found that multimodal treatment was particularly effective for improving social skills in children in highly stressful environments. It also was effective for those with anxiety and depression in addition to ADHD. Children who receive multimodal treatment may need lower doses of medications compared to children only receiving medication. A multimodal plan is effective for most children.

Can you get skin cancer again?,MASH,"""People who have had skin cancer once are at risk for getting it again.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> All potentially cancerous skin growths must be biopsied to confirm a cancer diagnosis. Depending on the suspected type of skin cancer, the biopsy techniques vary slightly but crucially. Any potential melanoma requires a surgical biopsy, in which the entire growth is removed with a scalpel if possible. A pathologist then studies the sample under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present. Ifmelanomais diagnosed, other tests may be ordered to assess the degree of cancer spread (metastasis). They include: Imaging. Your doctor will order one or more tests to look for metastasis. They include CT scan, MRI, PET scan, bone scan, and chest X-ray. Other biopsies. Using a variety of techniques, your doctor may want to get tissue samples from lymph nodes. Skin growths that are most likely basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or other forms of non-melanoma can be biopsied in various ways. Part or all of the growth can be taken with a scalpel for examination under a microscope. Most skin cancers are detected and cured before they spread. Melanoma that has spread to other organs presents the greatest treatment challenge. Standard treatments for localized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are safe and effective and cause few side effects. Small tumors can be surgically excised, removed with skin scraping and electric current cauterization, frozen with liquid nitrogen, or killed with low-dose radiation. In rare cases where basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma has begun to spread beyond the local skin site, the primary tumors are first removed surgically. Then patients may be treated with radiation, immunotherapy in the form of interferon, and rarely, chemotherapy. However, responses to this therapy are infrequent and short-lived. Rare patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma respond well to a combination of retinoic acid (a derivative of vitamin A) and interferon (a type of disease-fighting protein produced in labs for cancer immunotherapy). Retinoic acid may inhibit cancer recurrence in patients who have had tumors removed, but there is a lack of evidence to support either of these treatments. Vismodegib ( Erivedge) may be used to treat the rare cases of locally advanced, or metastatic, basal cell carcinoma and has been shown to shrink these tumors. Sonidegib ( Odomzo) can be used to treat patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma who are not candidates for surgery or radiation. It may also be used if the skin cancer returns after surgery or radiation. Melanoma tumors must be removed surgically, preferably before they spread beyond the skin into other organs. The surgeon removes the tumor fully, along with a safe margin of surrounding tissue and possibly nearby lymph nodes. Neither radiation nor chemotherapy will cure advanced melanoma, but either treatment may slow the disease and relieve symptoms. Chemotherapy, sometimes in combination with immunotherapy -- such as interferon, interleukin-2 -- is generally preferred. If melanoma spreads to the brain, radiation is used to slow the growth and control symptoms. Proton therapy may be used, as well. Immunotherapy is a field of cancer treatment that attempts to target and kill cancer cells by manipulating the body's immune system. Some of the most promising developments in the field of immunotherapy have arisen from efforts to cure advanced melanoma. Some researchers are treating advanced cases with vaccines, while others are using drugs such as interferon, interleukin-2, and ipilimumab ( Yervoy) in an effort to stimulate immune cells into attacking melanoma cells more aggressively. In patients with advanced melanoma, two drugs, nivolumab ( Opdivo) and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) have been found to be effective after use of ipilimumab. These drugs help block proteins on T cells that normally help keep them in check, therefore allowing these immune cells to attack melanoma cells. Genetic manipulation of melanoma tumors may make them more vulnerable to attack by the immune system. Each of these treatment approaches aims to immunize a patient's body against its own cancer -- something the body cannot do naturally. There are other drugs that target specific genes within normal cells that cause them to become cancerous. Called targeted therapy, these drugs include dabrafenib ( Tafinlar), trametinib ( Mekinist) and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf). People who have had skin cancer once are at risk for getting it again. Anyone who has been treated for skin cancer of any kind should have a checkup at least twice a year. About 20% of skin cancer patients experience recurrence or a second separate tumor, often within the first two years after diagnosis. Once skin cancer is diagnosed, the only acceptable treatment is medical care. Alternative approaches may be useful in cancer prevention and in combating nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and headaches from chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy used to treat advanced skin cancer. Be sure to discuss any alternative treatments you are considering using with your cancer doctor. Skin experts know that the mineral zinc and the antioxidant vitamins A (beta-carotene), C, and E can help repair damaged body tissue and promote healthy skin. Now, researchers are trying to determine whether these and other nutrients might protect skin from the harmful effects of sunlight. To test the theory, selected skin cancer patients are given experimental supplements of these vitamins in the hope of preventing cancer recurrence.

Can you get skin cancer again?,MASH,"""About 20% of skin cancer patients experience recurrence or a second separate tumor, often within the first two years after diagnosis.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> All potentially cancerous skin growths must be biopsied to confirm a cancer diagnosis. Depending on the suspected type of skin cancer, the biopsy techniques vary slightly but crucially. Any potential melanoma requires a surgical biopsy, in which the entire growth is removed with a scalpel if possible. A pathologist then studies the sample under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present. Ifmelanomais diagnosed, other tests may be ordered to assess the degree of cancer spread (metastasis). They include: Imaging. Your doctor will order one or more tests to look for metastasis. They include CT scan, MRI, PET scan, bone scan, and chest X-ray. Other biopsies. Using a variety of techniques, your doctor may want to get tissue samples from lymph nodes. Skin growths that are most likely basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or other forms of non-melanoma can be biopsied in various ways. Part or all of the growth can be taken with a scalpel for examination under a microscope. Most skin cancers are detected and cured before they spread. Melanoma that has spread to other organs presents the greatest treatment challenge. Standard treatments for localized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are safe and effective and cause few side effects. Small tumors can be surgically excised, removed with skin scraping and electric current cauterization, frozen with liquid nitrogen, or killed with low-dose radiation. In rare cases where basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma has begun to spread beyond the local skin site, the primary tumors are first removed surgically. Then patients may be treated with radiation, immunotherapy in the form of interferon, and rarely, chemotherapy. However, responses to this therapy are infrequent and short-lived. Rare patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma respond well to a combination of retinoic acid (a derivative of vitamin A) and interferon (a type of disease-fighting protein produced in labs for cancer immunotherapy). Retinoic acid may inhibit cancer recurrence in patients who have had tumors removed, but there is a lack of evidence to support either of these treatments. Vismodegib ( Erivedge) may be used to treat the rare cases of locally advanced, or metastatic, basal cell carcinoma and has been shown to shrink these tumors. Sonidegib ( Odomzo) can be used to treat patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma who are not candidates for surgery or radiation. It may also be used if the skin cancer returns after surgery or radiation. Melanoma tumors must be removed surgically, preferably before they spread beyond the skin into other organs. The surgeon removes the tumor fully, along with a safe margin of surrounding tissue and possibly nearby lymph nodes. Neither radiation nor chemotherapy will cure advanced melanoma, but either treatment may slow the disease and relieve symptoms. Chemotherapy, sometimes in combination with immunotherapy -- such as interferon, interleukin-2 -- is generally preferred. If melanoma spreads to the brain, radiation is used to slow the growth and control symptoms. Proton therapy may be used, as well. Immunotherapy is a field of cancer treatment that attempts to target and kill cancer cells by manipulating the body's immune system. Some of the most promising developments in the field of immunotherapy have arisen from efforts to cure advanced melanoma. Some researchers are treating advanced cases with vaccines, while others are using drugs such as interferon, interleukin-2, and ipilimumab ( Yervoy) in an effort to stimulate immune cells into attacking melanoma cells more aggressively. In patients with advanced melanoma, two drugs, nivolumab ( Opdivo) and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) have been found to be effective after use of ipilimumab. These drugs help block proteins on T cells that normally help keep them in check, therefore allowing these immune cells to attack melanoma cells. Genetic manipulation of melanoma tumors may make them more vulnerable to attack by the immune system. Each of these treatment approaches aims to immunize a patient's body against its own cancer -- something the body cannot do naturally. There are other drugs that target specific genes within normal cells that cause them to become cancerous. Called targeted therapy, these drugs include dabrafenib ( Tafinlar), trametinib ( Mekinist) and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf). People who have had skin cancer once are at risk for getting it again. Anyone who has been treated for skin cancer of any kind should have a checkup at least twice a year. About 20% of skin cancer patients experience recurrence or a second separate tumor, often within the first two years after diagnosis. Once skin cancer is diagnosed, the only acceptable treatment is medical care. Alternative approaches may be useful in cancer prevention and in combating nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and headaches from chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy used to treat advanced skin cancer. Be sure to discuss any alternative treatments you are considering using with your cancer doctor. Skin experts know that the mineral zinc and the antioxidant vitamins A (beta-carotene), C, and E can help repair damaged body tissue and promote healthy skin. Now, researchers are trying to determine whether these and other nutrients might protect skin from the harmful effects of sunlight. To test the theory, selected skin cancer patients are given experimental supplements of these vitamins in the hope of preventing cancer recurrence. Thus far, no nutrient has been found to be protective against skin cancer.</p>",2025-11-25 04:41:35-08:00,False,Response is valid.
How do I know if I have hepatitis C?,MASH,"""You can be infected with the hepatitis C virus and have no symptoms.

Your doctor could find it when he checks your blood and sees that your level of certain liver enzymes is high. If that happens, he'll follow up with other tests to confirm you have the disease. Some doctors say you should get tested at least once no matter what. Definitely get screened if any of these things apply to you: Were born between 1945 and 1965 Currently using or injecting drugs Ever injected drugs -- even if it was just once or a long time ago Have HIV Are on kidney dialysis Have abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels ( ALT) Had a blood transfusion, blood components, or an organ transplant before July 1992 Got clotting factor concentrates made before 1987 Received blood from a donor who later tested positive for hepatitis C virus ( HCV) Health care workers, first responders, and other whose work exposes them to HCV-infected needles Children born to women with HCV You can have hep C with no symptoms. The test is quick and easy. You'll protect family and friends. Treatment can suppress the virus and maybe even cure you. Early treatment prevents cirrhosis and liver failure. Doctors will start by checking your blood for: Anti- HCV antibodies: These are proteins your body makes when it finds the hep C virus in your blood. They usually show up about 12 weeks after infection. How long does it take to get results? It usually takes a few days to a week to get results, though a rapid test is available in some places. What do the results mean? Non- Reactive or negative: You don't have hep C. If you've been exposed in the last 6 months, you'll need to be retested. Reactive or positive: You have hep C antibodies, and you've been infected at some point. You'll need another test to make sure. If your antibody test is positive, you'll get this test: RNA: It measures the number of viral RNA (genetic material from the hepatitis virus) particles in your blood. Your doctor might refer to this as your viral load. They usually show up 1-2 weeks after you're infected. What do the results mean? Negative: You don't have hep C. Positive: You have hep C. As part of the diagnosis process, you might also get: Liver function tests: They measure proteins and enzymes levels, which usually rise 7 to 8 weeks after you're infected. As your liver gets damaged, enzymes leak into your bloodstream. But you can have normal enzyme levels and still have hepatitis C. Once the doctor knows you have hep C, he'll do tests to find out more about your condition. They could include: Genotype tests to find out which of the six kinds (genotypes) of hepatitis C you have. Tests to check for liver damage. You might get: Elastography: Doctors use a special ultrasound machine to feel how stiff your liver is. Liver biopsy: The doctor inserts a needle into your liver to take a tiny piece to examine in the lab. Imaging tests: These use various methods to take pictures or show images of your insides. They include: CT scan Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) Magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE) Ultrasound Liver function tests ( LFTs) or liver enzyme tests: These blood tests help the doctor know how well your liver is working These test results will help the doctor decide which treatment is right for you.

How can you reduce the mosquito population to prevent dengue fever?,MASH,"""Regularly change the water in outdoor bird baths and pets' water dishes.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Dengue (pronounced DENgee) fever is a painful, debilitating mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses.

That will help keep you safe from dengue fever, a virus spread by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Once an infected mosquito bites someone, they can get a fever, headaches, and pain in the joints, muscles, bones, and behind the eyes. Some people get a rash and have nausea and vomiting. It sounds awful, but most people recover in a week or so. But if the symptoms get worse and you don't see a doctor, it can become life threatening. There is unfortunately no vaccine or cure for dengue fever, so if you think you have it, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take a pain reliever with acetaminophen. Don't take aspirin.

Most cases occur in tropical areas of the world, with the greatest risk occurring in: The Indian subcontinent Southeast Asia Southern China Taiwan The Pacific Islands The Caribbean (except Cuba and the Cayman Islands) Mexico Africa Central and South America (except Chile, Paraguay, and Argentina) Most cases in the United States occur in people who contracted the infection while traveling abroad. But the risk is increasing for people living along the Texas- Mexico border and in other parts of the southern United States. In 2014, an outbreak of dengue fever was identified in Hawaii with other outbreaks in 2013 in Brownsville, Texas and Key West, Fla. Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus. The mosquito becomes infected when it bites a person with dengue virus in their blood. It can't be spread directly from one person to another person. Symptoms, which usually begin four to six days after infection and last for up to 10 days, may include Sudden, high fever Severe headaches Pain behind the eyes Severe joint and muscle pain Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Skin rash, which appears two to five days after the onset of fever Mild bleeding (such a nose bleed, bleeding gums, or easy bruising) Sometimes, symptoms are mild and can be mistaken for those of the flu or another viral infection. Younger children and people who have never had the infection before tend to have milder cases than older children and adults. However, serious problems can develop. These include dengue hemorrhagic fever, a rare complication characterized by high fever, damage to lymph and blood vessels, bleeding from the nose and gums, enlargement of the liver, and failure of the circulatory system. The symptoms may progress to massive bleeding, shock, and death. This is called dengue shock syndrome ( DSS). People with weakened immune systems as well as those with a second or subsequent dengue infection are believed to be at greater risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever. Doctors can diagnose dengue infection with a blood test to check for the virus or antibodies to it. If you become sick after traveling to a tropical area, let your doctor know. This will allow your doctor to evaluate the possibility that your symptoms were caused by a dengue infection. There is no specific medicine to treat dengue infection. If you think you may have dengue fever, you should use pain relievers with acetaminophen and avoid medicines with aspirin, which could worsen bleeding. You should also rest, drink plenty of fluids, and see your doctor. If you start to feel worse in the first 24 hours after your fever goes down, you should get to a hospital immediately to be checked for complications. The best way to prevent the disease is to prevent bites by infected mosquitoes, particularly if you are living in or traveling to a tropical area. This involves protecting yourself and making efforts to keep the mosquito population down. In 2019, the FDA approved a vaccine called Dengvaxia to help prevent the disease from occurring in adolescents aged 9 to 16 who have already been infected by dengue. But, there currently is no vaccine to prevent the general population from contracting it. To protect yourself: Use mosquito repellents, even indoors. When outdoors, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into socks. When indoors, use air conditioning if available. Make sure window and door screens are secure and free of holes. If sleeping areas are not screened or air conditioned, use mosquito nets. If you have symptoms of dengue, speak to your doctor. To reduce the mosquito population, get rid of places where mosquitoes can breed. These include old tires, cans, or flower pots that collect rain. Regularly change the water in outdoor bird baths and pets' water dishes.

When outdoors, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into socks. When indoors, use air conditioning if available. Make sure window and door screens are secure and free of holes. If sleeping areas are not screened or air conditioned, use mosquito nets. If you have symptoms of dengue, speak to your doctor. To reduce the mosquito population, get rid of places where mosquitoes can breed. These include old tires, cans, or flower pots that collect rain. Regularly change the water in outdoor bird baths and pets' water dishes. If someone in your home gets dengue fever, be especially vigilant about efforts to protect yourself and other family members from mosquitoes. Mosquitoes that bite the infected family member could spread the infection to others in your home.</p>",2025-11-25 06:39:21-08:00,False,Response is valid.
Should I take iron supplements if I have hemorrhoids?,MASH,"""Iron supplements can cause constipation and other digestive problems, so talk to your doctor before you take them""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> ' Eat more fiber.' ' Stay hydrated.' That's the advice everyone gets about hemorrhoids -- and it's good. But what does it mean in real life, when you're at the grocery store or deciding what to put on your plate? Let's take a look at specific foods that can help this painful problem and ways to work them into your meals. And on the flip side, what you may want to stay away from. Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like goo. ( Picture what happens to oats when you mix them with water.) You want this stuff. It makes your stool soft, well-formed, and easy to pass. No constipation, little irritation. Sounds like the Holy Grail of poop, right? Insoluble fiber is what your grandmother would call 'roughage.' It doesn't dissolve. ( If you drop a chunk of celery in water, it just sits there.) It helps to keep things moving through -- and out of -- your system and to balance the chemistry in your intestines. Many 'high-fiber' foods have both kinds. You should aim for 25-30 grams or more of fiber every day from what you eat, about twice what most Americans get. In general, you'll want about a third of that to be soluble (more when you have diarrhea). Too much fiber too fast can cause gas and bloating, so add a little bit to your diet at a time if you're not used to it. You'll also need to drink more fluids to help your body use that fiber: 8-10 large glasses (at least a half-gallon) of water every day. You'll get a lot of bang for your bite with the legume family. Just 1/2 cup of beans -- such as kidney, navy, lima, or black beans -- will cover about a third of your daily goal. It will have between 7 and 10 grams of fiber (both soluble and insoluble), depending on which variety you choose. About 20 almonds or pecans have around 3 grams of fiber. A 1/2 cup of edamame does, too, and it only has about half the calories. Instead of using just meat in chili and soups, add or substitute beans. You can also use beans and nuts in salads. Try Indian and Middle Eastern recipes, which often call for beans, lentils, and peas. Swap white breads, pastas, and crackers for versions made with whole-grain flours, buckwheat, stone-ground cornmeal, or rye to boost the amount of insoluble fiber you'll get. Cooked oats and barley will give you soluble fiber, too. Instead of a plain white bagel for breakfast, have a packet of instant oatmeal -- with twice the fiber for less than half the calories. Reach for no-butter popcorn when you get the munchies. Sprinkle oat bran or wheat germ on salads and soups. You can't go wrong with plant foods. Keep the skins on when they're thin, like on apples, pears, plums, and potatoes. That's where the insoluble fiber is, as well as compounds called flavonoids that can help control hemorrhoid bleeding. Brightly colored produce -- berries, grapes, tomatoes, and kale and other dark, leafy greens -- are generally rich in flavonoids. And the fresher, the better. Try to keep them whole and not damage the skins or leaves until you're ready to eat them. Avoid cooking to the point that their color fades. A serving of fruit is often good for at least 10% of your daily fiber, usually 3 to 4 grams. A cup of leafy greens, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, winter squash, or green peas will get you 4 to 5 grams of fiber. Some veggies and fruits have fiber plus a lot of water. Cucumbers, celery, mild bell peppers, and watermelon are mostly water -- more than 90%. Make a habit of adding another fruit or vegetable to any meal, like berries or bananas in your cereal, apple chunks on your salad, spinach in your omelet, or grated zucchini in your spaghetti sauce. Snack on dried fruits like figs, apricots, and dates. Swap sugary baked desserts for fresh fruit -- raw strawberries rather than strawberry pie. Foods with little fiber can cause or make constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids) worse, so it's best to limit how much you eat of them. White bread and bagels Milk, cheese, and other dairy Meat Processed foods such as frozen meals and fast food Watch the amount of salt you eat. It can lead to your body hanging on to water, which puts more pressure on your blood vessels. That includes the veins in your bottom that cause hemorrhoids. Iron supplements can cause constipation and other digestive problems, so talk to your doctor before you take them.</p>",2025-11-25 02:25:23-08:00,False,Response is valid.
