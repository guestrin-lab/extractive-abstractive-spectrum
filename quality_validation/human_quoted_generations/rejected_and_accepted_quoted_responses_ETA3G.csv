A little over two years after the theft, Peruggia made an attempt to sell the work to a dealer in Florence, in an attempt, he believed, to bring back to Italy a treasure that it had lost.

Explain to a third-grader: who wrote put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water,ETA3G,"""Put Your Hand in the Hand' is a gospel pop song composed by Gene MacLellan and first recorded by Canadian singer Anne Murray from her third studio album Honey, Wheat and Laughter""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> It became a hit single for the Canadian band Ocean, released as their debut single and title track to their debut album. The song peaked at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, kept from No. 1 by 'Joy to the World' by Three Dog Night. It remained in the top 10 for seven weeks, and was ranked as the No. 33 song for 1971 according to Billboard. The song also reached No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The band received fan mail for the song from religious figures such as Billy Graham and the Bishop of Toronto. After MacLellan's suicide in 1995, his friend and fellow Atlantic Canadian musician Ron Hynes wrote the song 'Godspeed' as a tribute, the lyrics for which reference the title of this song. The song was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2006. A remix from the same year adds an instrumental, which occurs between the second chorus and the second verse, as well as a repeat of the chorus and a final instrumentalist chorus, that ends without the fade. The song was covered in the 1970s by a number of other performers, including Elvis Presley (who also covered MacLellan's 'Snowbird'), Randy Stonehill, Larry Norman, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Frankie Laine, Donny Hathaway, Joan Baez, Shirley Caesar, Dutch group Himalaya, the Les Humphries Singers, a German-language version ('Ich fand eine Hand') [I Found a Hand] by Cindy & Bert, a French-language version ('Prends ma main') by Canadian singer Renée Martel, and recorded by Bing Crosby for his 1972 album Bing 'n' Basie. It was also covered, and often sung in concert, by Anita Bryant. Evangelist Garner Ted Armstrong rendered his take on the song in a January 1976 episode of Hee Haw. Country acts Sandy Posey, Lynn Anderson, Loretta Lynn, and The Oak Ridge Boys also recorded the song.

Visitors have always treated the mask with scepticism Right up there with Anita Ekberg's night-time plunge into the icy waters of the Trevi Fountain in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, it's one of the most iconic moments in Roman celluloid history: midway through William Wyler's classic Roman Holiday, Gregory Peck's hard-boiled reporter Joe takes princess-on-the-run Audrey Hepburn on a whistle-stop tour of the Eternal City on his vespa. Stopping off at Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Joe recounts the legend of the Mouth, whereupon a nervous Hepburn gingerly places her hand within. Nothing untoward happens, but when it is Peck's turn he begins roaring in agony as soon as he hesitatingly inserts his. Pulling it out, he demonstrates the apparently amputated arm to the panicking princess All is well, however, as Joe quickly reveals the ruse - his hand simply being hidden in his sleeve. According to cinematic lore, the ruse wasn't in the script and Peck's reaction really did frighten Hepburn - hence her tangible relief! </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> He opened his arms and I hugged that man so hard he tapped my shoulder because I was squeezing him.

Explain to a third-grader: who votes in the speaker of the house,ETA3G,"""At the start of a new Congress, those voting to elect the speaker are representatives-elect"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Constitution does not explicitly require the speaker to be an incumbent member of the House of Representatives, although every speaker thus far has been, and as a member the speaker also represents their district and retains the right to vote. The speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the vice president and ahead of the president pro tempore of the Senate. The 56th and current Speaker of the House is Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana. Selection The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress, biennially, after a general election, or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position during a congressional term. At the start of a new Congress, those voting to elect the speaker are representatives-elect, as a speaker must be selected before members are sworn in to office; the House of Representatives cannot organize or take other legislative actions until a speaker is elected. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. In practice, each party's caucus or conference selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of votes from the members present and voting. If no candidate wins a majority, the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Representatives are free to vote for someone other than the candidate nominated by their party but generally do not, as the outcome of the election effectively demonstrates which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House. Representatives who choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominee usually vote for someone else in their party or vote 'present', in which case their vote does not count in tallying the vote positively or negatively. Anyone who votes for the other party's candidate could face serious consequences, as was the case when Democrat James Traficant voted for Republican Dennis Hastert in 2001 (107th Congress). In response, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority, and he lost all of his committee posts. Upon election, the new speaker is sworn in by the dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member. Additionally, it is customary for the outgoing speaker, or the minority leader, to hand the speaker's gavel to the new speaker, as a mark of the peaceful transition of power. Eligibility of non-members While every speaker of the House has been a sitting House member, Article I, Section II, Clause 5, of the U.S. Constitution, concerning the choosing of a speaker, does not explicitly state House membership as a requirement. As noted by the Congressional Research Service, non-members have, on multiple occasions since 1997, received votes in speaker elections. In 1787, while the proposed Constitution was being considered, Pennsylvania Congress of the Confederation Delegate Tench Coxe publicly wrote the following: The house of representatives is not, as the Senate, to have a president chosen for them from without their body, but are to elect their speaker from their own number . . . . </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Historically, there have been several controversial elections to the speakership, such as the contest of 1839. In that case, even though the 26th United States Congress convened on December 2, the House could not begin the speakership election until December 14 because of an election dispute in New Jersey known as the 'Broad Seal War'. Two rival delegations, one Whig and the other Democrat, had been certified as elected by different branches of the New Jersey government. The problem was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority. Neither party agreed to permit a speakership election with the opposite party's delegation participating. Finally, it was agreed to exclude both delegations from the election and a speaker was finally chosen on December 17. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes legislation supported by the majority party. In pursuing this goal, the speaker may use their influence over the Rules committee, which is in charge of the business of the House. The speaker chairs the majority party's House steering committee, which selects the majority members of each House standing committee, including the Rules committee (although it's worth to note their appointment to the said committees must be ratified by a resolution of the full House). While the speaker is the functioning head of the House majority party, the same is not true of the president pro tempore of the Senate, whose office is primarily ceremonial and honorary. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Receives, along with the president pro tempore of the Senate, written declarations that a U.S. president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, or is able to resume them, under Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Additionally, the speaker is second in the presidential line of succession under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, immediately after the vice president and before the president pro tempore of the Senate (who is followed by members of the president's Cabinet). Thus, if both the presidency and vice-presidency were vacant simultaneously, then the speaker would become acting president, after resigning from the House and as speaker. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> When the House convenes on the first day of a new Congress, it must first establish that there are enough Members-elect to achieve a quorum, the constitutionally mandated minimum number that must be present to conduct business. The second item of business—even before Members are sworn in—is the election of a Speaker. Until a Speaker is elected, the Clerk from the previous Congress presides over the House. The Clerk calls for nominations for Speakership candidates, and the chairs of the Republican Conference and Democratic Caucus make short speeches on behalf of their parties' nominees. The Clerk then asks for any other nominations to be brought forward. Then the Clerk appoints tellers from among the Members-elect to record the votes, and the voting begins. Each Member-elect has the opportunity to vote when the Clerk calls his or her name. Typically, the Member-elect responds by calling out the last name of the person they wish to be Speaker. They may also answer 'present,' a response that does not count as a vote for anyone but does contribute to a quorum. Or they could decline to respond at all, in which case they would be considered not voting. (The forgoing is a description of what usually occurs at the beginning of a Congress. Extraordinary circumstances may vary these proceedings. An extensive treatment of the process of electing a Speaker, including information about unusual events, is available in the Precedents of the United States House of Representatives.) The vote for Speaker is a rare instance where a verbal roll call is made of each Member.  The House usually records its votes by electronic means, which saves a lot of time and allows Members to vote at any time during the 15-17 minutes usually reserved for a roll call.  But the Speaker's election is different, partly by tradition, but also because it is not a yes or no vote. In 2019, the Speakership vote took a little shy of 50 minutes, plus additional time to tally the result. To win the Speakership, a person must secure a simple majority of those present and voting. If each of the 435 Representatives-elect votes for a candidate, the majority would be 218. For each person who answers present or otherwise does not vote, the threshold to win a majority decreases. In effect, the threshold decreases by a vote for every two people who answer present or do not participate. So if 433 Members vote, a candidate would need 217 votes to win the Speakership. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> And while we're talking about Members-elect answering present: One practice that seems to be declining is that of nominees for the Speakership answering present when the Clerk calls upon them to cast their votes. In 2005, Hastert became the last of the official Republican or Democratic candidates to answer present. Since then, the Democratic candidate has been Nancy Pelosi and the Republican candidates have been John Boehner, Paul Ryan, and Kevin McCarthy. Pelosi's consistent practice has been to vote for herself (both when she was elected Speaker and the defeated candidate). In 2007, Boehner voted for himself (when he was defeated). In subsequent elections, rather than answer 'present,' he did not participate in the vote. Paul Ryan did not vote in either of his two elections (both successful). Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy voted for himself in 2019. Some protest candidates have also voted for themselves: Heath Shuler, a Democrat, in 2011 and Daniel Webster and Ted Yoho, both Republicans, in 2015. </p>",2025-11-19 19:54:27-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Explain to a third-grader: who votes in the speaker of the house,ETA3G,"""The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress, biennially, after a general election, or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position during a congressional term"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Constitution does not explicitly require the speaker to be an incumbent member of the House of Representatives, although every speaker thus far has been, and as a member the speaker also represents their district and retains the right to vote. The speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the vice president and ahead of the president pro tempore of the Senate. The 56th and current Speaker of the House is Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana. Selection The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress, biennially, after a general election, or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position during a congressional term. At the start of a new Congress, those voting to elect the speaker are representatives-elect, as a speaker must be selected before members are sworn in to office; the House of Representatives cannot organize or take other legislative actions until a speaker is elected. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. In practice, each party's caucus or conference selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of votes from the members present and voting. If no candidate wins a majority, the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Representatives are free to vote for someone other than the candidate nominated by their party but generally do not, as the outcome of the election effectively demonstrates which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House. Representatives who choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominee usually vote for someone else in their party or vote 'present', in which case their vote does not count in tallying the vote positively or negatively. Anyone who votes for the other party's candidate could face serious consequences, as was the case when Democrat James Traficant voted for Republican Dennis Hastert in 2001 (107th Congress). In response, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority, and he lost all of his committee posts. Upon election, the new speaker is sworn in by the dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member. Additionally, it is customary for the outgoing speaker, or the minority leader, to hand the speaker's gavel to the new speaker, as a mark of the peaceful transition of power. Eligibility of non-members While every speaker of the House has been a sitting House member, Article I, Section II, Clause 5, of the U.S. Constitution, concerning the choosing of a speaker, does not explicitly state House membership as a requirement. As noted by the Congressional Research Service, non-members have, on multiple occasions since 1997, received votes in speaker elections. In 1787, while the proposed Constitution was being considered, Pennsylvania Congress of the Confederation Delegate Tench Coxe publicly wrote the following: The house of representatives is not, as the Senate, to have a president chosen for them from without their body, but are to elect their speaker from their own number . . . . </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Historically, there have been several controversial elections to the speakership, such as the contest of 1839. In that case, even though the 26th United States Congress convened on December 2, the House could not begin the speakership election until December 14 because of an election dispute in New Jersey known as the 'Broad Seal War'. Two rival delegations, one Whig and the other Democrat, had been certified as elected by different branches of the New Jersey government. The problem was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority.

My Dad made/forced me watch it in 1985 - and I am glad he did. Unless people object, may I offer some trivia every day or so... feel free to add to it. You don't mess with the man with no eyes... Boss Godfrey had only one line in the whole movie. What was it ? Although he loved the look of Morgan Woodward as the intimidating Boss Godfrey, director Stuart Rosenberg felt that his voice didn't match up with his appearance. So Woodward had almost all of his dialogue stripped out, helping to establish his character as one of the more memorable ones that appeared in the film. His only line was ' Luke, fetch the rifle.' just before shooting the turtle. ' There's no such thing as a fly fisherman wholly satisfied with his casting performance.

It was published by Scribners and the first edition came out in 1965. Prior to becoming a published author, Pearce had done time in the army and had been arrested for counterfeiting American money in Europe. He escaped from a European jail, made his way to Canada and then back to America and became a safecracker. He was arrested in 1949 for burglary and served two years on a Florida chain gang.It was those years that he based the novel, Cool Hand Luke on. While the book is fiction, the main character is an extension of Donn Pearce himself. The story in the book is told from a narrator's point of view and details the time that Luke goes from first becoming part of a chain gang, to being christened 'Cool Hand Luke,' after winning a poker game, to his death at the end of the novel.Two years later the novel was made into a movie starring Paul Newman and Pearce wrote the original screenplay. The movie was nominated for multiple Academy Awards including best screenplay. Pearce had come pretty far from his days as a Florida safecracker.Donn Pearce wrote three other novels and had a career as a freelance journalist writing for Esquire and Playboy magazine among others. In addition to writing he also became a private investigator in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Esquire Article </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> COOL HAND LUKE is an audacious first film by director Stuart Rosenberg who had labored in television previously. With a screenplay by Donn Pearce and Frank R. Pierson based on Donn Pearce's novel, the hot, humid, sweaty world of a road prison's chain gang explodes from the screen thanks to famed cinematographer Conrad Hall's (BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID; TEQUILA SUNRISE) beautiful camerawork. Some critics felt the photography was too gorgeous for a prison film, but Rosenberg said he wanted to have a beautiful look offset the brutal conditions the prisoners inhabited. Lalo Schifrin's eclectic music with a nice guitar motif for Luke is fantastic too. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Based onCool Hand Lukeby Donn PearceProduced byGordon CarrollStarring Paul Newman George Kennedy J.

Newman stars in the title role as Luke, a prisoner in a Florida prison camp who refuses to submit to the system. Set in the early 1950s, it is based on Donn Pearce's 1965 novel Cool Hand Luke. Upon its release, Cool Hand Luke received favorable reviews and was a box-office success. It cemented Newman's status as one of the era's top actors, and was called the 'touchstone of an era'. Newman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, Kennedy won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Pearce and Pierson were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Lalo Schifrin was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. In 2005, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, considering it 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'. The film has a 100% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, and the prison warden's (Strother Martin) line in the film beginning with 'What we've got here is failure to communicate' was listed at number 11 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list. Plot </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Pearce, a merchant seaman who later became a counterfeiter and safe cracker, wrote the novel Cool Hand Luke about his experiences working on a chain gang while serving in a Florida prison. He sold the story to Warner Bros. for $80,000 and received another $15,000 to write the screenplay. After working in television for over a decade, Rosenberg chose it to make it his directorial debut in cinema. He took the idea to Jalem Productions, owned by Jack Lemmon. Since Pearce had no experience writing screenplays, his draft was reworked by Frank Pierson. Conrad Hall was hired as the cinematographer, while Paul Newman's brother, Arthur, was hired as the unit production manager. Newman's biographer Marie Edelman Borden wrote that the 'tough, honest' script drew together threads from earlier movies, especially Hombre, Newman's earlier film of 1967. Rosenberg altered the script's original ending, adding 'an upbeat ending that would reprise Luke's (and Newman's) trademark smile.' Casting </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> A sample of the line is included in the Guns N' Roses songs 'Civil War' and 'Madagascar'. Zero Mostel paraphrases the line in The Great Bank Robbery (1969). When Strother Martin hosted Saturday Night Live on April 19, 1980, he played the strict owner of a language camp for children, parodying his Cool Hand Luke role. He paraphrased his line from the movie as, 'What we have here is failure to communicate BILINGUALLY!' In Terry Pratchett's fantasy humor novel The Truth, hired thug Mr Pin says to Charlie, a kidnapped (and not very bright) shopkeeper he is somewhat unsuccessfully training to impersonate Lord Vetinari, the chief ruler of the city-state of Ankh-Morpork, 'I think what we have here is a failure to communicate.' Release and reception Cool Hand Luke opened on October 31, 1967, at Loew's State Theatre in New York City. The proceeds of the premiere went to charities. The film was a box-office success, grossing $16,217,773 in domestic screenings. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> In 2003, AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains rated Luke the 30th-greatest hero in American cinema, and three years later, AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers: America's Most Inspiring Movies rated Cool Hand Luke number 71. In 2006, Luke was ranked 53rd in Empire magazine's 'The 100 Greatest Movie Characters'. The film solidified Newman's status as a box-office star, while the film is considered a touchstone of the era. The film was an inductee of the 2005 National Film Registry list. An episode of the television show The Dukes of Hazzard titled 'Cool Hands Luke and Bo' was shown with Morgan Woodward playing 'Colonel Cassius Claiborne' the boss of a neighboring county and warden of its prison farm.

Explain to a third-grader: what are the different types of non communicable disease,ETA3G,"""Non-communicable diseases are non-infectious in nature and thus do not spread like communicable diseases""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Frequently Asked Questions What does NCD mean? 'NCD full form – Non-communicable Disease' Non-communicable diseases are non-infectious in nature and thus do not spread like communicable diseases. Most NCDs are chronic and last for a longer period of time. NCDs account for approximately 71% of global deaths. Furthermore, these deaths are concentrated in middle and low-income countries. The four major death-causing NCDs are – Cardiovascular Diseases Cancer Respiratory Diseases Diabetes The NCDs may occur due to lifestyle as well as genetic factors. Thus, some of them are also termed lifestyle diseases. The risk factors for NCDs are mostly poor diet, lack of exercise, inadequate sleep, smoking, alcohol consumption and stress. Let's have a detailed look at the two types of NCDs and the risk factors. Lifestyle Diseases Lifestyle diseases, like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, heart diseases, and stroke are a part of non-communicable diseases (NCD). Mental health diseases like trauma and depression are also included under this. Various physiological factors, along with improper diet and exercise, are a major cause of most NCDs. Physiological Factors Blood Pressure Cholesterol Blood Glucose Hyperlipidemia Overweight or Obesity Behavioural Factors Sedentary Lifestyle Unbalanced Diet Stress Tobacco and Alcohol People of all ages, gender and region are prone to these risk factors. In this, the behavioural factors are modifiable with proper lifestyle changes. Hypertension </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Genetic diseases are also NCDs that are caused due to abnormalities in genes or chromosomes. These errors can be either inherited or caused by mutations. Haemophilia, thalassemia, and muscular dystrophy are genetic diseases that run through generations in a family. Support and constant care are the only things that help to manage these disorders. Some other examples of genetic disorders are – Down's Syndrome (mutation) Cystic Fibrosis (mutation and inherited) Huntington's chorea (inherited) Haemophilia Haemophilia is a serious disease that is more common in men than women. It is a metabolic disorder associated with the X-linked recessive gene. It is characterised by uncontrolled bleeding, even from slight wounds. This is because of the lack of clot-forming substances (thromboplastin). There is no long term cure for haemophilia. Thalassemia </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> A non-communicable disease (NCD) is a disease that is not transmissible directly from one person to another. NCDs include Parkinson's disease, autoimmune diseases, strokes, heart diseases, cancers, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, cataracts, and others. NCDs may be chronic or acute. Most are non-infectious, although there are some non-communicable infectious diseases, such as parasitic diseases in which the parasite's life cycle does not include direct host-to-host transmission. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Risk factors such as a person's background; lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases. They include age, gender, genetics, exposure to air pollution, and behaviors such as smoking, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity which can lead to hypertension and obesity, in turn leading to increased risk of many NCDs. Most NCDs are considered preventable because they are caused by modifiable risk factors. The WHO's World Health Report 2002 identified five important risk factors for non-communicable disease in the top ten leading risks to health. These are raised blood pressure, raised cholesterol, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and being overweight. The other factors associated with higher risk of NCDs include a person's economic and social conditions, also known as the social determinants of health. It has been estimated that if the primary risk factors were eliminated, 80% of the cases of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes and 40% of cancers could be prevented. Interventions targeting the main risk factors could have a significant impact on reducing the burden of disease worldwide. Efforts focused on better diet and increased physical activity have been shown to control the prevalence of NCDs . Environmental diseases NCDs include many environmental diseases covering a broad category of avoidable and unavoidable human health conditions caused by external factors, such as sunlight, nutrition, pollution, and lifestyle choices. The diseases of affluence are non-infectious diseases with environmental causes. Examples include: Many types of cardiovascular disease (CVD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by smoking tobacco Diabetes mellitus type 2 Noise-induced hearing loss Lower back pain caused by too little exercise </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Historically, many NCDs were associated with economic development and were so-called a 'diseases of the rich'.

Explain to a third-grader: which brazilian player is known as the black diamond of football,ETA3G,"""Leônidas da Silva was known as 'Black Diamond""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Leônidas da Silva was known as 'Black Diamond' and considered the greatest Brazilian footballer before the war. He was credited to be the inventor of 'Bicycle Kick'.  He played in two World Cup  Finals: 1934 and 1938. He was the top scorer at the tournament in 1938.  He played for a number of clubs in Brazil and Penarol. His longest spells were with Flamengo and Sao Paulo.  He was known as the 'Black Diamond' and the 'Rubber Man' due to his agility. Leônidas da Silva ST: Muller (Brazil) Muller is one of São Paulo's all-time leading scorers with 158 goals. With the club he won the Intercontinental Cup in 1993 as he scored the third goal against AC Milan in Tokyo. He capped 56 times with Brazil. He participated in the 1986, 1990, and 1994 editions of the FIFA World Cup, and was part of the 1994 champion Brazil squad. ST: Serginho Chulapa (Brazil) </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Leônidas da Silva (Portuguese pronunciation: [leˈõnidɐz dɐ ˈsiwvɐ]; 6 September 1913 – 24 January 2004) was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward. He is regarded as one of the most important players of the first half of the 20th century. At the height of his career, Leônidas da Silva was very popular amongst the people of Brazil and Rio de Janeiro. Leônidas played for Brazil national team in the 1934 and 1938 World Cups, and was the top scorer of the latter tournament. He was known as the 'Black Diamond' and the 'Rubber Man' due to his agility. Club career </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Historically, Leônidas is well known for his contributions to the relationship between consumerism and the business side of football within the country of Brazil. In the year 1938, Leônidas especially gained massive popularity after his appearance in the World Cup tournament and it was around this time he started to receive numerous advertisement offers, such as for watches and cigarettes. His willingness to participate in interviews and being a constant within the public eye helped his fans feel personally connected to Leônidas. Later that same year, a voting popularity contest was held including Leônidas and he received 249,080 votes in his favor, thus winning the contest. During the 1938 World Cup, Leônidas was nicknamed Diamante Negro (black diamond). In the next year, Brazilian chocolate manufacturer Lacta purchased from him the right to name a chocolate bar as Diamante Negro. This chocolate brand became a commercial success in Brazil. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈɛdsõ aˈɾɐ̃tʃiz du nasiˈmẽtu]; 23 October 1940 – 29 December 2022), better known by his nickname Pelé (Portuguese pronunciation: [peˈlɛ]), was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century. In 1999, he was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee and was included in the Time list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. In 2000, Pelé was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century. His 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, which includes friendlies, is recognised as a Guinness World Record. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> On 29 June 1958, Pelé became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in Stockholm, the capital. Pelé hit the post and then Vavá scored two goals to give Brazil the lead. Pelé's first goal, where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pelé's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment, 'When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding'. When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament. His impact was arguably greater off the field, with Barney Ronay writing, 'With nothing but talent to guide him, the boy from Minas Gerais became the first black global sporting superstar, and a source of genuine uplift and inspiration.' </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century, Pelé is one of the most lauded players in the history of football and has been frequently ranked the best player ever. Following his emergence at the 1958 World Cup he was nicknamed O Rei ('The King'). Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated, 'Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic.' Brazil's 1970 World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined: 'His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game.' According to Tostão, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup: 'Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé.' His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed: 'In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful.' According to Franz Beckenbauer, West Germany's 1974 World Cup-winning captain: 'Pelé is the greatest player of all time. He reigned supreme for 20 years. There's no one to compare with him.' </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> In 2000, the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) voted Pelé the World Player of the Century. In 1999, the International Olympic Committee elected him the Athlete of the Century and Time magazine named Pelé one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the highest-paid athlete in the world. Pelé's 'electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals' made him a star around the world. To take full advantage of his popularity, his teams toured internationally. During his career, he became known as 'The Black Pearl' (A Pérola Negra), 'The King of Football' (O Rei do Futebol), 'The King Pelé' (O Rei Pelé) or simply 'The King' (O Rei). In 2014, the city of Santos inaugurated the Pelé museum – Museu Pelé – which displays a 2,400 piece collection of Pelé memorabilia. Approximately $22 million was invested in the construction of the museum, housed in a 19th-century mansion. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> (230)National team1932–1946 Brazil 19 (21) * Senior club appearances and goals counted for the domestic league only Leônidas da Silva (6 September 1913 – 24 January 2004) was a Brazilian football player.

Early life[change | change source] </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> Beginning in the 1900s, football's popularity began to move from the elite classes to the masses and importantly this included former slaves. From 1910, players of African descent emerged on the Brazilian football scene in the form of Arthur Friedenreich, Joaquim Prado and many others. Such players did not disappoint, either. Friedenreich was in many ways the original Pelé and was arguably the first black sporting superstar Brazil had. Over the course of his career, Friedenreich scored over 1200 goals and yet despite this, his career was not without controversy, albeit through no fault of his own.

Explain to a third-grader: who wrote the original little red riding hood story,ETA3G,"""Adapted from the Brothers Grimm by Gennady Spirin""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Little Red Riding Hood – Adapted from the Brothers Grimm by Gennady Spirin Of all of the versions that I could get my hands on, this one stays truest to the original Grimm version, down to her red cap rather than cloak. Little Red's mother sends her off with the reminder to 'mind your manners and do not leave the path for any reason.' The wolf is larger than life, fancily dressed. and he fiercely attacks Little Red's grandmother. Upon hearing the wolf's loud snores after his grand meal, the hunters manage to save Little Red and her grandmother and Little Red learns to never speak to strangers and always listen to her mother. Little Red Riding Hood – The Brother's Grimm, Illustrated by Bernadette Watts </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The story has varied considerably in different versions over the centuries, translations, and as the subject of numerous modern adaptations. Other names for the story are 'Little Red Cap' or simply 'Red Riding Hood'. It is number 333 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system for folktales. Plot Original version 'Little Red Riding Hood' as illustrated in a 1927 story anthology The story centers around a girl named Little Red Riding Hood, after the red hooded cape that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation). In the Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to several likely pre-17th century versions from various European countries. Some of these are significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by French peasants in the 10th century and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster Egbert of Liège. A fifteenth-century collection of folklore described an anecdote about a woman whose husband was a werewolf though it bares little resemblance to Perrault's text. In Italy, Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century, where a number of versions exist, including La finta nonna (The False Grandmother), written among others by Italo Calvino in the Italian Folktales collection. It has also been called 'The Story of Grandmother'. It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. 'Grandaunt Tiger'). </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Apart from the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual. Some are listed below. Natural cycles Folklorists and cultural anthropologists, such as P. Saintyves and Edward Burnett Tylor, saw 'Little Red Riding Hood' in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles. Her red hood could represent the bright sun which is ultimately swallowed by the terrible night (the wolf), and the variations in which she is cut out of the wolf's belly represent the dawn. In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and Sköll, the wolf in Norse mythology that will swallow the personified Sun at Ragnarök, or Fenrir. Alternatively, the tale could be about the season of spring or the month of May, escaping the winter.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem Little Red Riding Hood in The Court Journal, 1835 is subtitled Lines suggested by the engraving of Landseer's Picture. It reflects on memories of lost childhood. Charles Perrault's 'Le Petit Chaperon rouge' ('Little Red Riding Hood') is centered on an erotic metaphor. Gabriela Mistral, the Chilean Nobel Prize-winning poet, told the story as a short poem as part of her 1924 book, Ternura </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The version of Little Red Riding Hood featured in the Junior Classics Fairy and Wonder Tales (published in 1918) was originally written down by Charles Perrault in the seventeenth century, though people point out that he's probably not the source of the original idea. He merely preserved this version by writing it down. Some say that he may have heard it from his children's nurse who participated in an oral tradition of storytelling. Stories of a girl meeting a wolf in the forest date back hundreds of years before Perrault. Perrault's story is incredibly abrupt. The beginning and middle are unsurprising to anyone who's heard a version of the story before. There's a beautiful girl with a red riding hood. She's loved by her mother and her grandmother. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The most famous version of the story is the one written by the Brothers Grimm in the 19th century.[2] The Brothers Grimm listened to many traditional stories from old people and wrote them into a book.[3] They did not originally mean for their book to be read as children's stories; they were writing down German folklore for scholars to read. But their book became famous as a book of children's stories anyway.[3] The title of the story is properly translated as 'Little Red Cap' even though it is usually known in English as 'Little Red Riding Hood'.[4] In this German picture-book, Red Riding Hood has poured a glass of beer for her Grandmother. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> In these early versions of the story, Red Riding Hood escapes on her own. She uses her own intelligence and her own courage. The Brothers Grimm and other later authors added male heroes who save Red Riding Hood.[5][8] Charles Perrault[change | change source] The story was first written and published in a book from 1697 by the French writer Charles Perrault. The name of the book, in English, is Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals: Tales of Mother Goose. The story is called The Little Red Cap (Le Petit Chaperon Rouge).[9] Perrault's version of the tale is the original printed version, but it is likely based on an older oral tradition. It is uncertain if Perrault knew a folk tale from the south of France about a girl who cleverly escapes a werewolf occupying her grandmother's bed.[10] Perrault wanted to make a strong point about wise and foolish behaviour. He wanted to show that a beautiful young woman was in danger of having men with bad morals try to trick her into wrong behaviour.[5] In Perrault's story the girl is eaten and there is no happy ending.[11] Other versions[change | change source] The story has been changed many times in the centuries following its publication. It is a little different from the way that the Brothers Grimm tell it.[12] In their version, a huntsman slays the child-devouring wolf. He then frees the heroine from the animal's stomach. An English illustration from the 1920s In some modern versions of the story, especially versions for very young children, the grandmother does not die.

Little Red Riding Hood is thought to have originated in the 17th century. According to Hannah Newton, author of The Sick Child in Early Modern England, 1580–1720, in 17th century England, almost one-third of young people died before they were 15 years old. And 'Rather than shielding their offspring from these foreboding facts, parents encouraged their children to think about their own mortality.' (source) Indeed, in tale after tale, death or the possibility of death makes a recurring appearance. Little Red Riding Hood is an instructive tale that warns about threats to one's own mortality. Do not talk to strangers — or you may die. Beware of wolves — or you may die. Similarly, with The Gingerbread Man. Do not unthinkingly place your trust in strangers, even if they appear to be trying to help you — or you may die. Death was a significant and real threat, so many of these stories provided instruction as to how to avoid death. </p>",2025-11-19 19:15:01-08:00,False,Response is valid.
Explain to a third-grader: what is the plot of anne of green gables,ETA3G,"""Anne of Green Gables tells the story of a young orphan girl named Anne Shirley who is mistakenly sent to live with a pair of elderly siblings, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, on Prince Edward Island. Despite Marilla's initial reluctance to keep her, Anne's charm, intelligence, and imaginative spirit soon win over their hearts and those of the entire community.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Story structure is essential to the psychological appeal of a narrative. It engages readers, builds anticipation, and creates a desire to know what happens next. This blog post aims to demonstrate the creative universality of story structure with a plot analysis of the classic novel Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery. By David G Brown Anne of Green Gables tells the story of a young orphan girl named Anne Shirley who is mistakenly sent to live with a pair of elderly siblings, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, on Prince Edward Island. Despite Marilla's initial reluctance to keep her, Anne's charm, intelligence, and imaginative spirit soon win over their hearts and those of the entire community. Coming of Age A coming-of-age narrative, also known as a bildungsroman, is often structured differently than most novels. The overall trajectory involves the character growing up through a series of formative experiences, but if we dig into the different relationship threads, it's usually possible to find the one goal that forms the story's backbone. To put that another way, the primary narrative goal is an arrow fired in the inciting incident which will hit a target in the climax. However, in a coming-of-age story, that goal isn't necessarily something the protagonist pursues on every page. Anne of Green Gables offers many episodic threads that work together to deeply characterize herself, her adoptive parents, and many of the other residents of Avonlea. There is one thread, however, that directly connects the inciting incident with the climax: her relationship with Matthew. Narrative Goal Anne's narrative journey is primarily relational—she wants to be accepted and loved, but she also has an irrepressible desire to speak her mind and express herself. Therefore, the plot grows out of several relationship threads in which Anne strives for love and acceptance. Her obstacles include the town's initial prejudices toward orphans and Anne's blunt tongue and temper. Anne's narrative goal crystalizes in her cart ride from the train station to her new home in Avonlea—a scene in which it's clear Anne and Matthew have an instant bond. Quite simply, Anne's goal is that she doesn't want to lose Matthew. Plot Points Stasis Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, aging and unmarried siblings, decide to adopt a boy to help them around the farm. Anne is an orphan and has been moving from one foster home to another before she is sent by mistake to the Green Gables farm in Avonlea. Inciting incident Since the primary trajectory grows out of Anne's desire to become Matthew's adopted daughter, the point of no return is when Matthew confesses to Marilla that he doesn't mind that they were sent a girl in error—he likes Anne and would like to keep her. There is no returning from this declaration of affection. With their bond established, the stakes are set. The reader knows exactly what they both stand to lose—each other. Rising action?! Anne of Green Gables has an unusual story shape not only because it's a coming-of-age narrative but also because it's a tragedy. So while there is episodic rising action as Anne moves through various challenges, conflicts, and learning experiences, there is also an easing of tension as the original threat—that she might be sent back to the orphanage—fades from possibility. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Anne of Green Gables is a 1908 novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery (published as L. M. Montgomery). Written for all ages, it has been considered a classic children's novel since the mid-20th century. Set in the late 19th century, the novel recounts the adventures of 11-year-old orphan girl Anne Shirley sent by mistake to two middle-aged siblings, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, who had originally intended to adopt a boy to help them on their farm in the fictional town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The novel recounts how Anne makes her way through life with the Cuthberts, in school, and within the town. Since its publication, Anne of Green Gables has been translated into at least 36 languages and has sold more than 50 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books worldwide. It was the first of many novels; Montgomery wrote numerous sequels, and since her death another sequel has been published, as well as an authorized prequel titled Before Green Gables.

Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New York's Metropolitan Magazine and put on the wall of her bedroom as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her 'youthful idealism and spirituality.' Montgomery was inspired by the 'formula Ann' orphan stories (called such because they followed such a predictable formula) that were popular at the time, but distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra 'e'. She based other characters, such as Gilbert Blythe, in part on people she knew.

This blog post aims to demonstrate the creative universality of story structure with a plot analysis of the classic novel Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery. By David G Brown Anne of Green Gables tells the story of a young orphan girl named Anne Shirley who is mistakenly sent to live with a pair of elderly siblings, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, on Prince Edward Island. Despite Marilla's initial reluctance to keep her, Anne's charm, intelligence, and imaginative spirit soon win over their hearts and those of the entire community. Coming of Age A coming-of-age narrative, also known as a bildungsroman, is often structured differently than most novels. The overall trajectory involves the character growing up through a series of formative experiences, but if we dig into the different relationship threads, it's usually possible to find the one goal that forms the story's backbone. To put that another way, the primary narrative goal is an arrow fired in the inciting incident which will hit a target in the climax. However, in a coming-of-age story, that goal isn't necessarily something the protagonist pursues on every page. Anne of Green Gables offers many episodic threads that work together to deeply characterize herself, her adoptive parents, and many of the other residents of Avonlea. There is one thread, however, that directly connects the inciting incident with the climax: her relationship with Matthew. Narrative Goal Anne's narrative journey is primarily relational—she wants to be accepted and loved, but she also has an irrepressible desire to speak her mind and express herself.

If the bowler bowls a wide or a no-ball, that illegal delivery is not counted towards the six-ball tally, and another delivery must be bowled in its place.

However, overs in Test cricket originally had four balls per over, and there have been varying numbers of balls per over around the world up to 1979/80, generally the same as the number of balls per over in force in other first-class cricket in that country. Prior to the Laws of Cricket (1980 Code), law 17.1 - Number of balls (in the over), did not explicitly specify the number of balls to be bowled in an over, but merely stated that the number of balls should be agreed by the two captains prior to the toss. In practice, the number of balls was usually stipulated in the playing regulations governing the match being played. Although six was the usual number of balls, it was not always the case. From the 1980 code onwards, law 17.1 was amended to read, 'The ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls'.

No. Apart from the six-ball over, which has been the standard since 1979-80, an over has variously consisted of four, five, and eight balls at various points in time.When and where were the variants prevalent? The first recorded over consisted of four balls, and overs were four-ball till 1889, when it changed to five balls per. In 1900 there was a move to six-ball overs.In the 1922-23 season, Australia chose to play eight-ball overs, and two seasons later New Zealand followed suit.Has it been six-ball overs since 1900 everywhere except Australia and New Zealand? No. In 1939, England started a two-year experiment in domestic cricket to trial the eight-ball over, but it lasted only a year, since war broke out in autumn. When cricket returned to England, they reverted to the six-ball rule. South Africa used eight-ball overs from 1938-39 to 1957-58, and Pakistan from 1974-75 to 1977-78. Even New Zealand went back to the six-ball over when cricket resumed after the war. In 1968-69 they changed again - to the eight-ball over again, before finally moving to the six-ball system with the rest of the world.Why all the chopping and changing? There is no recorded reason for the moves from four balls to five and from five to six. But it is understood that the shortness of four- and five-ball overs - which meant too many over changes in the course of a day, and also did not afford bowlers too much leeway in terms of building up a rhythm and plotting a dismissal - contributed to their demise.The thinking in Australia behind extending the over to eight balls was to get more balls bowled in a day's play, as an eight-ball over meant fewer change-overs. But there were demerits too: bowlers tended to slow down for fear they would wear themselves out.The ICC's rules for a long time provided for both kinds of over - six-ball and eight-ball - depending on the conditions of play in the host country.Again there is no recorded official reason for the move to six balls after 1978-79, but it is widely believed that with the commercialisation of the sport and post the Kerry Packer revolution, there was no room for the eight-ball over, and the six-ball over was a happy balance.Terms of Use  •  Privacy Policy  •  Your US State Privacy Rights  •  Children's Online Privacy Policy  •  Interest - Based Ads  •  Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information  •  Feedback </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Start date Oct 4, 2007 M mamdani New Member Joined Oct 4, 2007 Messages 21 Oct 4, 2007 #1 Hi, I am working on a cricket score board in Mircorsoft Excel. This is my first question. When I solve this, I will go ahead. In the sport of cricket, an over is a set of six consecutive balls bowled in succession. An over is normally bowled by a single bowler. An over is made up of six balls, each ball counts for 1/6 of an over for the purposes of calculating the net run rate, despite being normally written in cricket's notation as .1 of an over. if a bowler balls 6 consecutive balls. it is called an over and writting in cricket's notation as 1 over. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Cricket is an international bat and ball game played at a variety of levels by both genders from primary school age to adults. Predominantly an outdoor Summer sport, matches are played between two teams on a natural grass field, with a central rectangular pitch with wickets (a set of 3 wooden stumps) at each end. The objective of the game is to accumulate more runs than the opposition team. A team comprises of 11 players with batters, bowlers (fast and spin) and a wicket keeper. A '12th man' is a reserve fielder should any player become injured, however also delivers drinks, snacks and towels at designated breaks. All team members bat and field, while only the bowlers and all-rounders bowl. Cricket has three forms of the game based on duration. Matches are measured in overs (6 balls bowled per over) and an 'innings' is a descriptor for the number of times the teams contest each other. Format Innings/Overs Duration T20 1/ 20 (max) ~3 hours: 75-90min innings, 10-20min interval One Day </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> There are two periods where hits beyond 120 metres have been reported regularly: back in the 19th century, and more recently, in the past couple of decades. The claims from the 19th century are led by a supposed hit of 175 yards (160 metres) by a fellow named Fellows in 1856. It is still mentioned in Wisden. However, even as long ago as 1960, cricket historian Gerald Brodribb, in his book Hit for Six, was sceptical about this one, and believed that it was a measure of total length of travel, not the length hit to pitch. The shot, which was made in practice, was to publicise a new (but by our standards still primitive) type of bat. The promotional purpose of the claim makes it dubious. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Another hint comes from the low number of over-the-boundary hits in the 19th and early 20th century. Detailed research by cricket historian Ross Smith and others comes up with a total of just 95 such over-the-boundary hits in Tests prior to 1900. Under the scoring system of the time, most of those shots counted as five (or sometimes four) runs, but even if counted as sixes, that represents only 1.2% of all runs scored. In Tests since 2000 on the same grounds, more than 3% of runs have come through sixes. Even allowing for modern boundary ropes, why were there so few such hits back then if so many players could supposedly strike the ball 130 yards and more, especially since it was possible, before 1910, to score a six by hitting the ball 'out of the ground'? In more than 60 Tests in England and Australia before 1902, only two such out-of-the-ground hits were recorded. Both were by Joe Darling, one in Adelaide in 1898 (over the short square boundary) and one, according to the Melbourne Argus, at Trent Bridge in 1899. </p>",2025-11-19 20:00:32-08:00,False,Response is valid.

When cricket returned to England, they reverted to the six-ball rule. South Africa used eight-ball overs from 1938-39 to 1957-58, and Pakistan from 1974-75 to 1977-78. Even New Zealand went back to the six-ball over when cricket resumed after the war. In 1968-69 they changed again - to the eight-ball over again, before finally moving to the six-ball system with the rest of the world.Why all the chopping and changing? There is no recorded reason for the moves from four balls to five and from five to six. But it is understood that the shortness of four- and five-ball overs - which meant too many over changes in the course of a day, and also did not afford bowlers too much leeway in terms of building up a rhythm and plotting a dismissal - contributed to their demise.The thinking in Australia behind extending the over to eight balls was to get more balls bowled in a day's play, as an eight-ball over meant fewer change-overs. But there were demerits too: bowlers tended to slow down for fear they would wear themselves out.The ICC's rules for a long time provided for both kinds of over - six-ball and eight-ball - depending on the conditions of play in the host country.Again there is no recorded official reason for the move to six balls after 1978-79, but it is widely believed that with the commercialisation of the sport and post the Kerry Packer revolution, there was no room for the eight-ball over, and the six-ball over was a happy balance.Terms of Use  •  Privacy Policy  •  Your US State Privacy Rights  •  Children's Online Privacy Policy  •  Interest - Based Ads  •  Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information  •  Feedback </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Start date Oct 4, 2007 M mamdani New Member Joined Oct 4, 2007 Messages 21 Oct 4, 2007 #1 Hi, I am working on a cricket score board in Mircorsoft Excel.

Explain to a third-grader: when did cricket go to 6 ball overs,ETA3G,"""Since 1979/80, all Test cricket has been played with six balls per over."" ","<p><b>Source 1:</b> After six deliveries the umpire calls 'over'; the fielding team switches ends, and a different bowler is selected to bowl from the opposite end. The captain of the fielding team decides which bowler will bowl any given over, and no bowler may bowl two overs in succession. Overview Although this has not always been so, with overs of four and eight balls used in the past, currently an over must consist of six legal deliveries. If the bowler bowls a wide or a no-ball, that illegal delivery is not counted towards the six-ball tally, and another delivery must be bowled in its place. During the middle of an over, in the event that a bowler is injured or is sent out of the attack by the umpire (for disciplinary reasons, such as bowling beamers), a teammate completes any remaining deliveries. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Cricket imposes penalties if a team bowls its overs at a very slow over rate, such as fines, loss of competition points, and match bans. If a team is proceeding slowly, some captains will choose to use slow/spin bowlers. Such bowlers have a shorter run up so they complete their overs more quickly. Often this means choosing an inferior strategy by employing a less skilful bowler to avoid penalties that are perceived to be greater, such as being banned or losing points. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Since 1979/80, all Test cricket has been played with six balls per over. However, overs in Test cricket originally had four balls per over, and there have been varying numbers of balls per over around the world up to 1979/80, generally the same as the number of balls per over in force in other first-class cricket in that country. Prior to the Laws of Cricket (1980 Code), law 17.1 - Number of balls (in the over), did not explicitly specify the number of balls to be bowled in an over, but merely stated that the number of balls should be agreed by the two captains prior to the toss. In practice, the number of balls was usually stipulated in the playing regulations governing the match being played. Although six was the usual number of balls, it was not always the case. From the 1980 code onwards, law 17.1 was amended to read, 'The ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls'.

Present-day distribution of marsupials Introduced Native Marsupials are a diverse group of mammals belonging to the infraclass Marsupialia. They are natively found in Australasia, Wallacea, and the Americas. One of the defining features of marsupials is their unique reproductive strategy, where the young are born in a relatively undeveloped state and then nurtured within a pouch on their mother's abdomen. Living marsupials encompass a wide range of species, including kangaroos, koalas, opossums, Tasmanian devils, wombats, wallabies, and bandicoots, among others. Marsupials constitute a clade stemming from the last common ancestor of extant metatherians, which encompasses all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals. This evolutionary split between placentals and marsupials occurred at least 125 million years ago, possibly dating back over 160 million years to the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous period. Presently, close to 70% of the 334 extant species of marsupials are concentrated on the Australian continent, including mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and nearby islands. The remaining 30% are distributed across the Americas, primarily in South America, with thirteen species in Central America and a single species, the Virginia opossum, inhabiting North America north of Mexico. Marsupials range in size from a few grams in the long-tailed planigale, to several tonnes in the extinct Diprotodon. The word marsupial comes from marsupium, the technical term for the abdominal pouch. It, in turn, is borrowed from the Latin marsupium and ultimately from the ancient Greek μάρσιππος mársippos, meaning 'pouch'. Anatomy Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) Marsupials have the typical characteristics of mammals—e.g., mammary glands, three middle ear bones, (and ears that usually have tragi, varying in hearing thresholds) and true hair. There are, however, striking differences as well as a number of anatomical features that separate them from eutherians. Most female marsupials have a front pouch, which contains multiple teats for the sustenance of their young. Marsupials also have other common structural features. Ossified patellae are absent in most modern marsupials (though a small number of exceptions are reported) and epipubic bones are present. Marsupials (and monotremes) also lack a gross communication (corpus callosum) between the right and left brain hemispheres. Skull and teeth Marsupials exhibit distinct cranial features compared to placental mammals. Generally, their skulls are relatively small and compact.

Explain to a third-grader: where was the hindenburg scheduled to fly and how many passengers were on it,ETA3G,"""The Hindenburg disaster was an airship accident that occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, U.S.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Hindenburg disaster was an airship accident that occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, U.S. The LZ 129 Hindenburg (Luftschiff Zeppelin #129; Registration: D-LZ 129) was a German commercial passenger-carrying rigid airship, the lead ship of the Hindenburg class, the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume. It was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH) and operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei). It was named after Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who was president of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. Filled with hydrogen, it caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst. The accident caused 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen) among the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), and an additional fatality on the ground. The disaster was the subject of newsreel coverage, photographs and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. A variety of theories have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The publicity shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era. Flight Background The Hindenburg made ten trips to the United States in 1936. After opening its 1937 season by completing a single round-trip passage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in late March, the Hindenburg departed from Frankfurt, Germany, on the evening of May 3, on the first of ten round trips between Europe and the United States that were scheduled for its second year of commercial service. American Airlines had contracted with the operators of the Hindenburg to shuttle passengers from Lakehurst to Newark for connections to airplane flights. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Hindenburg had a duralumin structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads along its length, with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship's outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater's skins. In 1931 the Zeppelin Company purchased 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) of duralumin salvaged from the wreckage of the October 1930 crash of the British airship R101. Dining room Lounge, with the world map painted on the wall Hindenburg's </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Four years after construction began in 1932, Hindenburg made its maiden test flight from the Zeppelin dockyards at Friedrichshafen on March 4, 1936, with 87 passengers and crew aboard. These included the Zeppelin Company chairman, Dr. Hugo Eckener, as commander, former World War I Zeppelin commander Lt. Col. Joachim Breithaupt representing the German Air Ministry, the Zeppelin Company's eight airship captains, 47 other crew members, and 30 dockyard employees who flew as passengers. Harold G. Dick was the only non-Luftschiffbau representative aboard. Although the name Hindenburg had been quietly selected by Eckener over a year earlier, only the airship's formal registration number (D-LZ129) and the five Olympic rings (promoting the 1936 Summer Olympics to be held in Berlin that August) were displayed on the hull during its trial flights. As the airship passed over Munich on its second trial flight the next afternoon, the city's Lord Mayor, Karl Fiehler, asked Eckener by radio the LZ129's name, to which he replied 'Hindenburg'. On March 23, Hindenburg made its first passenger and mail flight, carrying 80 reporters from Friedrichshafen to Löwenthal. The ship flew over Lake Constance with Graf Zeppelin. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> On October 8, 1936, Hindenburg made a 10.5 hour flight (the 'Millionaires Flight') over New England carrying 72 wealthy and influential passengers including financier and future U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winthrop W. Aldrich, his 28-year-old nephew Nelson Rockefeller, who became the Governor of New York and, later, Vice President of the United States, various German and American government officials and military officers, as well as key figures in the aviation industry, including Juan Trippe, founder and Chief Executive of Pan American Airways, and World War I flying ace Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, president of Eastern Airlines. The ship arrived at Boston by noon and returned to Lakehurst at 5:22 pm before making its final transatlantic flight of the season back to Frankfurt. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Hindenburg also had an experimental aircraft hook-on trapeze similar to the one on the U.S. Navy Goodyear–Zeppelin built airships Akron and Macon. This was intended to allow customs officials to be flown out to Hindenburg to process passengers before landing and to retrieve mail from the ship for early delivery. Experimental hook-ons and takeoffs, piloted by Ernst Udet, were attempted on March 11 and April 27, 1937, but were not very successful, owing to turbulence around the hook-up trapeze. The loss of the ship ended all prospects of further testing. Final flight: May 3–6, 1937 Main article: Hindenburg disaster After making the first South American flight of the 1937 season in late March, Hindenburg left Frankfurt for Lakehurst on the evening of 3 May, on its first scheduled round trip between Europe and North America that season. Although strong headwinds slowed the crossing, the flight had otherwise proceeded routinely as it approached for a landing three days later. Hindenburg's arrival on 6 May was delayed for several hours to avoid a line of thunderstorms passing over Lakehurst, but around 7:00 pm the airship was cleared for its final approach to the Naval Air Station, which it made at an altitude of 200 m (660 ft) with Captain Max Pruss in command. At 7:21 pm a pair of landing lines were dropped from the nose of the ship and were grabbed hold of by ground handlers. Four minutes later, at 7:25 pm Hindenburg burst into flames and dropped to the ground in a little over half a minute. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crew aboard, 13 passengers and 22 crew died, as well as one member of the ground crew, a total of 36 lives lost. Herbert Morrison's commentary of the incident became a classic of audio history. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> On May 6, 1937, the rigid German airship Hindenburg arrived at its Lakehurst, NJ, Naval Air Station destination after departing Frankfurt, Germany 3 days earlier. A crowded landing field of newspaper and radio journalists, film and still camera people, family, friends, and ground crew waited for the airship despite arriving hours behind schedule. As the Hindenburg prepared to dock with its mooring mast, it suddenly burst into flames forcing passengers and crew to jump from windows to escape the inferno. In seconds, the airship was completely destroyed and 36 people were dead. The disaster was immortalized as the first major aviation accident captured by photographs, sound recordings, and motion picture film. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH built the rigid passenger airship Hindenburg (LZ129) between 1931 and 1936 at its facility in Friedrichshafen, Germany.

Explain to a third-grader: where was the hindenburg scheduled to fly and how many passengers were on it,ETA3G,"""The airship approached its destination, Lakehurst, N.J., with 36 passengers and 61 crew aboard.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Hindenburg disaster was an airship accident that occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, U.S. The LZ 129 Hindenburg (Luftschiff Zeppelin #129; Registration: D-LZ 129) was a German commercial passenger-carrying rigid airship, the lead ship of the Hindenburg class, the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume. It was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH) and operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei). It was named after Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who was president of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. Filled with hydrogen, it caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst. The accident caused 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen) among the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), and an additional fatality on the ground. The disaster was the subject of newsreel coverage, photographs and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. A variety of theories have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The publicity shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era. Flight Background The Hindenburg made ten trips to the United States in 1936. After opening its 1937 season by completing a single round-trip passage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in late March, the Hindenburg departed from Frankfurt, Germany, on the evening of May 3, on the first of ten round trips between Europe and the United States that were scheduled for its second year of commercial service. American Airlines had contracted with the operators of the Hindenburg to shuttle passengers from Lakehurst to Newark for connections to airplane flights. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Hindenburg had a duralumin structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads along its length, with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship's outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater's skins. In 1931 the Zeppelin Company purchased 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) of duralumin salvaged from the wreckage of the October 1930 crash of the British airship R101. Dining room Lounge, with the world map painted on the wall Hindenburg's </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Four years after construction began in 1932, Hindenburg made its maiden test flight from the Zeppelin dockyards at Friedrichshafen on March 4, 1936, with 87 passengers and crew aboard. These included the Zeppelin Company chairman, Dr. Hugo Eckener, as commander, former World War I Zeppelin commander Lt. Col. Joachim Breithaupt representing the German Air Ministry, the Zeppelin Company's eight airship captains, 47 other crew members, and 30 dockyard employees who flew as passengers. Harold G. Dick was the only non-Luftschiffbau representative aboard. Although the name Hindenburg had been quietly selected by Eckener over a year earlier, only the airship's formal registration number (D-LZ129) and the five Olympic rings (promoting the 1936 Summer Olympics to be held in Berlin that August) were displayed on the hull during its trial flights. As the airship passed over Munich on its second trial flight the next afternoon, the city's Lord Mayor, Karl Fiehler, asked Eckener by radio the LZ129's name, to which he replied 'Hindenburg'. On March 23, Hindenburg made its first passenger and mail flight, carrying 80 reporters from Friedrichshafen to Löwenthal. The ship flew over Lake Constance with Graf Zeppelin. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> On October 8, 1936, Hindenburg made a 10.5 hour flight (the 'Millionaires Flight') over New England carrying 72 wealthy and influential passengers including financier and future U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winthrop W. Aldrich, his 28-year-old nephew Nelson Rockefeller, who became the Governor of New York and, later, Vice President of the United States, various German and American government officials and military officers, as well as key figures in the aviation industry, including Juan Trippe, founder and Chief Executive of Pan American Airways, and World War I flying ace Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, president of Eastern Airlines. The ship arrived at Boston by noon and returned to Lakehurst at 5:22 pm before making its final transatlantic flight of the season back to Frankfurt. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Hindenburg also had an experimental aircraft hook-on trapeze similar to the one on the U.S. Navy Goodyear–Zeppelin built airships Akron and Macon. This was intended to allow customs officials to be flown out to Hindenburg to process passengers before landing and to retrieve mail from the ship for early delivery. Experimental hook-ons and takeoffs, piloted by Ernst Udet, were attempted on March 11 and April 27, 1937, but were not very successful, owing to turbulence around the hook-up trapeze. The loss of the ship ended all prospects of further testing. Final flight: May 3–6, 1937 Main article: Hindenburg disaster After making the first South American flight of the 1937 season in late March, Hindenburg left Frankfurt for Lakehurst on the evening of 3 May, on its first scheduled round trip between Europe and North America that season. Although strong headwinds slowed the crossing, the flight had otherwise proceeded routinely as it approached for a landing three days later. Hindenburg's arrival on 6 May was delayed for several hours to avoid a line of thunderstorms passing over Lakehurst, but around 7:00 pm the airship was cleared for its final approach to the Naval Air Station, which it made at an altitude of 200 m (660 ft) with Captain Max Pruss in command. At 7:21 pm a pair of landing lines were dropped from the nose of the ship and were grabbed hold of by ground handlers. Four minutes later, at 7:25 pm Hindenburg burst into flames and dropped to the ground in a little over half a minute. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crew aboard, 13 passengers and 22 crew died, as well as one member of the ground crew, a total of 36 lives lost. Herbert Morrison's commentary of the incident became a classic of audio history. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> On May 6, 1937, the rigid German airship Hindenburg arrived at its Lakehurst, NJ, Naval Air Station destination after departing Frankfurt, Germany 3 days earlier. A crowded landing field of newspaper and radio journalists, film and still camera people, family, friends, and ground crew waited for the airship despite arriving hours behind schedule. As the Hindenburg prepared to dock with its mooring mast, it suddenly burst into flames forcing passengers and crew to jump from windows to escape the inferno. In seconds, the airship was completely destroyed and 36 people were dead. The disaster was immortalized as the first major aviation accident captured by photographs, sound recordings, and motion picture film. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH built the rigid passenger airship Hindenburg (LZ129) between 1931 and 1936 at its facility in Friedrichshafen, Germany.

Explain to a third-grader: why is ireland not a member of the commonwealth,ETA3G,"""On 18 April 1949, Ireland formally became a republic in accordance with the Irish Republic of Ireland Act 1948; in doing so, it also formally left the Commonwealth""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Commonwealth of Nations, often simply referred to as the Commonwealth, is an international association of 56 member states, the vast majority of which are former territories of the British Empire from which it developed. They are connected through their use of the English language and historical-cultural ties. The chief institutions of the organisation are the Commonwealth Secretariat, which focuses on intergovernmental relations, and the Commonwealth Foundation, which focuses on non-governmental relations between member nations. Numerous organisations are associated with and operate within the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of the 20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories. It was originally created as the British Commonwealth of Nations through the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference, and formalised by the United Kingdom through the Statute of Westminster in 1931. The current Commonwealth of Nations was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949, which modernised the community and established the member states as 'free and equal'. The Head of the Commonwealth is Charles III. He is king of 15 member states, known as the Commonwealth realms, whilst 36 other members are republics, and five others have different monarchs. Although he became head upon the death of his mother, Elizabeth II, the position is not technically hereditary. Member states have no legal obligations to one another, though some have institutional links to other Commonwealth nations. Citizenship of a Commonwealth country affords benefits in some member countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, and Commonwealth countries are represented to one another by high commissions rather than embassies. The Commonwealth Charter defines their shared values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, as promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games.

Whilst Ireland had not actively participated in the Commonwealth since the early 1930s, other dominions wished to become republics without losing Commonwealth ties. The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a Commonwealth prime ministers' meeting in London. Under the London Declaration, as drafted by V. K. Krishna Menon, India agreed, when it became a republic in January 1950, it would remain in the Commonwealth and accept the British Sovereign as a 'symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth'. Upon hearing this, King George VI told Menon: 'So, I've become 'as such''. Some other Commonwealth countries that have since become republics have chosen to leave, whilst others, such as Guyana, Mauritius and Dominica, have remained members. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Some member states grant particular rights to Commonwealth citizens. The United Kingdom and several others, mostly in the Caribbean, grant the right to vote to resident Commonwealth citizens. Some countries, including the United Kingdom, have preferential citizenship acquisition or residency policies for Commonwealth citizens. Initially, Commonwealth countries were not considered to be 'foreign' to each other as their citizens were British subjects. Citizenship laws have evolved independently in each Commonwealth country.

I've always been a sucker for love songs, especially those that speak of melancholy and the pain of a broken heart.  Randy VanWarmer had a great one back in 1979 entitled, 'Just When I Needed You Most.'  One of the great lines in that song goes: 'Cause I need you more than I, needed before and now, where I'll find comfort, God knows, cause you left me — just when I needed you most.' Wow, now that's heartache. It's true. Sometimes in life, people fail us, just when we needed them most. Reflecting on this song got me to thinking about my relationship with God and pondering whether He is any different.  'Has He ever left me, just when I needed Him most? </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> VanWarmer was inspired to write 'Just When I Needed You Most' by two events: his old car, that he loved and used for years, broke down on his way to work in Denver, Colorado, and he experienced a 'devastating' breakup with a girlfriend. He wrote the song six months after that breakup, co-writing it with Tony Wilson of the group Hot Chocolate two years before it became a hit. After recording 'Just When I Needed You Most' for an album recorded for the UK division of Bearsville Records, VanWarmer then flew to the US to pressure Bearsville's head office to promote the album which was duly remixed and released with 'Just When I Needed You Most' as lead single although VanWarmer would recall that Bearsville evinced little enthusiasm for the track: 'Nobody thought my version was an especially good version of the song [which] a few other people were thinking of cutting...Everybody just assumed mine was a demo for people to listen to who'd [then] cut the definitive version'. It has also been asserted that 'Your Light' the flip was the original intended A-side of VanWarmer's single. Released as a single in February 1979, VanWarmer's 'Just When I Needed You Most' spent two weeks atop the US Billboard adult contemporary chart in May of that year and in June 1979 reached its peak position of No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, accruing an overall Top 40 tenure of 14 weeks and earning RIAA Gold record status. In addition, the track reached No. 71 on the Billboard country music chart. and in September 1979 made the Top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 8. VanWarmer attributed his single's success to empathy for its heartbreak scenario: 'It's happened to everyone. That emotion is universal...I always hoped the record wasn't wallowing in self-pity and it had some redeeming value, and I guess it does.' VanWarmer also attributed his single's success to the autoharp instrumental break between the second and third verses, performed by John Sebastian. Chart performance Weekly charts Chart (1979) Peakposition Australia (Kent Music Report) 17 Canada RPM Top Singles Dolly Parton recorded a cover version of the song for her 1996 album, Treasures: this version, which like the VanWarmer original featured John Sebastian on autoharp, reached No. 62 on the Billboard country music chart. Other artists who either recorded or performed the song in concert include country music singers Tim McGraw, Donna Fargo, Skeeter Davis, Rhonda Vincent and Conway Twitty, R&B vocalist Millie Jackson, the German disco musician Peter Griffin, British glam rock band Smokie, reggae artists Barbara Jones, and Eddie Lovette, Filipino singer Pops Fernandez, Bob Dylan, Paul Butterfield, Billy Joe Royal, and the Spanish group Mocedades. In 2002, the American-Taiwanese singer Will Pan released a bilingual English/Chinese version of the song. Dana Winner recorded 'Just When I Needed You Most' for her 2011 album Unforgettable. Anne Nolan recorded 'Just When I Needed You Most' for her 2013 debut solo album Just One Voice. In 1978, before it was a hit, 'Just When I Needed You Most' was recorded by Ian Hunter, Mick Ronson, Corky Laing, and Felix Pappalardi. This version of the song was not released until 1999 when it was included on the 'Secret Sessions' CD. A Finnish rendering of 'Just When I Needed You Most' entitled 'Juuri Kun Tarvitsin Sua' was recorded by ELF (fi) for their 1979 album Tarantella-Joe. Ingela 'Pling' Forsman wrote lyrics in Swedish as När jag behövde dig mest, which was recorded by Swedish dansband Wizex on the 1980 album You Treated Me Wrong.

In addition, the track reached No. 71 on the Billboard country music chart. and in September 1979 made the Top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 8. VanWarmer attributed his single's success to empathy for its heartbreak scenario: 'It's happened to everyone. That emotion is universal...I always hoped the record wasn't wallowing in self-pity and it had some redeeming value, and I guess it does.' VanWarmer also attributed his single's success to the autoharp instrumental break between the second and third verses, performed by John Sebastian.

I've always been a sucker for love songs, especially those that speak of melancholy and the pain of a broken heart.  Randy VanWarmer had a great one back in 1979 entitled, 'Just When I Needed You Most.'  One of the great lines in that song goes: 'Cause I need you more than I, needed before and now, where I'll find comfort, God knows, cause you left me — just when I needed you most.' Wow, now that's heartache. It's true. Sometimes in life, people fail us, just when we needed them most.

Of course, siblings doesn't mean twins. The 1975 third draft specifies Luke's age as 20 and Leia's as 16.

Explain to a third-grader: when do we find out luke and leia are siblings,ETA3G,"""Padme dies giving birth to twins, Luke and Leia"" and ""Neither of the twins know of their relation until the events of Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983).""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> It definitely wasn't the idea during ESB. By that point Lucas had decided to pair up Leia & Han, no doubt because of the real-life chemistry/affair between Carrie Fisher & Harrison Ford. But both characters would likely be killed off during the third SW film. Nonetheless, having Luke & Leia be siblings, complete with incest plotline, was likely an idea on the table during the writing of the first film. This was back when Lucas almost certainly assumed that Luke rather than Han would 'get the girl'. Hence why Ralph McQuarrie's 1975 third-draft concept art varies between depicting Leia with long dark hair or a blonde bowl cut almost identical to Luke's, while Luke's own character design is invariably in the sandy-haired Flash Gordon mold. Of course, siblings doesn't mean twins. The 1975 third draft specifies Luke's age as 20 and Leia's as 16. But in both the Ring Cycle and Arthurian mythology, the incest is between half-siblings born at different times, rather than twins. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Lucas intended the Star Wars film saga to go on for 9 or 12 movies, and Luke would not meet the Emperor until the final film. Also, I believe Leia was not originally intended to be Luke's sister. Having said that, I'm glad he changed his mind. Honestly, I only find the kiss Leia gave Luke at the beginning of TESB awkward because she was trying to make Han jealous. The one she gave Luke after she and Lando rescued him is understandable, given how Luke was injured. She didn't know that they were related. So, it's forgivable. Lol.

In the first film, it's clear that Luke takes a huge love interest in Leia, when he first sees her in the hologram, and feels jealous when Han says he wanted to be with her. From the start, Lucas did intend for their to be siblings in the OT. In the first draft of ANH, Kane Starkiller had two sons. Annikan (17) and Deak (11). The latter is killed within the first 'few minutes'. In draft number two, there were actually five sons. Cliegg (age unknown), Deak (25), Luke (17), Biggs and Windy (7). Cliegg has died off screen. The twins only appear on Utapau, where they're being raised by the Lars, who are also training Luke. In the third draft, Luke appears to be an only child. With TESB, Lucas and Brackket wanted to refer to Luke's sister Nela, who was hidden elsewhere. This was dropped when Lucas wrote the second draft and included an early version of 'There is another'. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> In the first film, it's clear that Luke takes a huge love interest in Leia, when he first sees her in the hologram, and feels jealous when Han says he wanted to be with her.

I can see why Kershner would think that. I know what you mean, but it's siblings. It's not like Leia was a trans man. But that would be interesting. All good.

It was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Miguel Sapochnik. Cersei Lannister plots to destroy all her immediate enemies with one swift stroke; Jon Snow is declared King in the North by the lords of the Northern houses; Bran Stark learns that Jon is actually the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen; Samwell Tarly arrives at the Citadel; and Daenerys Targaryen begins heading to Westeros alongside Tyrion Lannister, her entire army, her three dragons, as well as the Ironborn loyal to Yara Greyjoy, the Tyrells, the Sand Snakes, and their respective fleets. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Game of Thrones concluded what's arguably its best season with one of its finest — and the bloodiest — episodes, 'The Winds of Winter', which excelled in dramatic storytelling just as last week's 'Battle of the Bastards' raised the bar for action sequences. Though the finale shifted from the battlefield, the events were, if anything, far more seismic, with game-changing revelations and huge moves from every corner of the realm that established some very clear new conflicts going into season 7. Just look at all that happened in those 69 minutes: Dany set sail for Westeros, Dorne joined forces with both Dany and the Tyrells, Arya returned to Westeros and crossed a major name off her list, Jon became King in the North, and Cersei blew up her enemies and then claimed the Iron Throne for herself.

The number of recurring characters who were killed in this episode (eleven) is greater than in any of the former episodes. Of those, only two characters have died by the point the books reached - Kevan and Pycelle, both killed by Varys in the epilogue of the fifth book; Loras was horrifically harmed during the siege of Dragonstone in the novels, but he is still alive.

The dragons still look cool, and I guess we're in for a bunch of epic battles going forward with a pared down cast and basically nothing left for the show to do but have all-out war.

Explain to a third-grader: who is the director of nightmare before christmas,ETA3G,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas) is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy film directed by Henry Selick in his feature directorial debut.""  ","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas) is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy film directed by Henry Selick in his feature directorial debut and produced and conceived by Tim Burton. It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of 'Halloween Town', who stumbles upon 'Christmas Town' and schemes to take over the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix, and Ed Ivory. The Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the critical success of Vincent that same year, Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film or a half-hour television special, to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label because the studio believed the film would be 'too dark and scary for kids'. The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film, but lost to Jurassic Park. The film has been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010. In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.' Plot </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Ed Ivory as Santa Claus, the ruler of Christmas Town. Santa is responsible for the annual celebration of Christmas, in which he delivers presents to children in the real world. He is also referred to by Jack and Halloween Town's residents as 'Sandy Claws.' Ivory also provides the brief narration at the start of the film. Joe Ranft as Igor, one of Dr Finkelstein's creations and his lab assistant. Paul Reubens as Lock, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie. Reubens and Burton had previously worked on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Batman Returns. The cast also features Kerry Katz, Carmen Twillie, Randy Crenshaw, Lisa Donovan Lukas, Debi Durst, Glenn Walters, Sherwood Ball, John Morris and Greg Proops voicing various characters. Patrick Stewart recorded narration for a prologue and epilogue. While not used in the final film, the narration is included on the soundtrack album. Production Development Director Henry Selick and producer/creator Tim Burton. As writer Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. 'Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, […] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before,' Burton would later recall. After completing his short film Vincent in 1982, Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas. Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, but also considered other options such as a children's book. He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models; Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time. After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special. However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed 'too weird' to the company. As Disney was unable to 'offer his nocturnal loners enough scope', Burton was fired from the studio in 1984 and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989) for Warner Bros. Pictures. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California, with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming. Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation. At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming. In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book. In addition, Selick stated, 'When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.' Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory. Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film's soundtrack. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally going to be released under Walt Disney Pictures as part of the Walt Disney Feature Animation lineup, but Disney decided to release the film under the studio's adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures banner, because the studio thought the film would be 'too dark and scary for kids,' Selick remembered. 'Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.' To convey Burton's involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that, '…it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about.' The film made its world premiere on the opening day celebration of the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29, 1993. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 95% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's critics consensus reads, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.' On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating 'universal acclaim'. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade 'B+' on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert praised the film's visual inventiveness: 'One of the many pleasures of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is that there is not a single recognizable landscape in it. Everything looks strange and haunting. Even Santa Claus would be difficult to recognize without his red-and-white uniform.' He wrote that it presented a world 'that is as completely new as the worlds we saw for the first time in such films as Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it a restoration of 'originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. … It's 74 minutes of timeless movie magic.' James Berardinelli stated 'The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain.' Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film's similarities to the writings of Oscar Wilde and the Brothers Grimm, as well as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and other German Expressionist films. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> A specific piece of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas' legacy has been anything but dreamy for director Henry Selick. The filmmaker — who helmed Disney's 1993 animated musical about Halloween Town resident Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon) discovering the magic of Christmas — recently told The A.V. Club that he has a bit of resentment over the fact that Tim Burton, who produced the film and conceived its story, tends to get all the credit for making the beloved classic. </p>",2025-11-19 19:00:10-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label because the studio believed the film would be 'too dark and scary for kids'. The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film, but lost to Jurassic Park. The film has been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010. In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.'

As writer Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. 'Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, […] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before,' Burton would later recall. After completing his short film Vincent in 1982, Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas. Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, but also considered other options such as a children's book. He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models; Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time. After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special. However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed 'too weird' to the company. As Disney was unable to 'offer his nocturnal loners enough scope', Burton was fired from the studio in 1984 and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989) for Warner Bros. Pictures. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California, with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming.

","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas) is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy film directed by Henry Selick in his feature directorial debut and produced and conceived by Tim Burton.

Water extinguishes a fire by cooling, which removes heat because of water's ability to absorb massive amounts of heat as it converts to water vapor. Without heat, the fuel cannot keep the oxidizer from reducing the fuel in order to sustain the fire. Water also extinguishes a fire by smothering it. When water is heated to its boiling point, it converts to water vapor. When this conversion takes place, it dilutes the oxygen in the air above the fire, thus removing one of the elements that the fire requires to burn. This can also be done with foam. Another way to extinguish a fire is fuel removal. This can be accomplished by stopping the flow of liquid or gaseous fuel, by removing solid fuel in the path of a fire, or by allowing the fire to burn until all the fuel is consumed, at which point the fire will self-extinguish. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> One common way to extinguish a fire is to spray it with water. The water has two roles: It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire, and this vapor displaces the oxygen (the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water, at 1,000 °F (538 °C) it expands over 4,000 times). This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent, and it dies out. The vaporization of water also absorbs heat; it thereby cools the smoke, air, walls, and objects that could act as further fuel, and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow, which is by 'jumping' to nearby heat/fuel sources to start new fires, which then combine. Water extinguishment is thus a combination of 'asphyxia' (cutting off the oxygen supply) and cooling. The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia, but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area. For outdoor fires, the seat of the fire is sprayed with a straight spray: the cooling effect immediately follows the 'asphyxia' caused by vaporization and reduces the further amount of water required. This is because water droplets, upon forming in to water mist, increase their surface area by a large magnitude, greatly increasing the endothermic cooling effect and robbing the fire of oxygen. A straight spray is used so the water arrives massively to the seat of the fire before it vaporizes. A strong spray may also have a mechanical effect; it can disperse the combustible product and thus prevent the fire from starting again. Spray is always aimed at a surface or an object. For this reason, the strategy is sometimes called a two-dimensional or 2D attack. Until the 1970s, fires were usually attacked while they declined, using the same strategy as for open air fires. Now fires are attacked in their development phase because firefighters arrive sooner at the site of a fire and because of changes in building construction. The increasing use of thermal insulation confines the heat, and modern materials, especially polymers, produce much more heat than do traditional materials like wood, plaster, stone, and bricks. Under these conditions, there is a greater risk of backdraft and flashover. Directly spraying the seat of the fire in enclosed areas can have unfortunate consequences: the force of water pushes air in front of it, which supplies the fire with extra oxygen before the water. The most important issue is not combating the flames, but controlling the fire; for example, cooling the smoke so that it cannot spread and start fires further away, and endanger the lives of people, including the firefighters. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> cools the smoke which is then less likely to start a fire when it moves away. As gas cools it becomes denser (Charles's law); thus, it also reduces the mobility of the smoke and avoids a 'backfire' of water vapor. Also, the diffuse spray creates an inert 'water vapor sky', which prevents 'roll-over' (rolls of flames on the ceiling created by hot burning gases). Only short pulses of water need to be sprayed, otherwise the spraying modifies the equilibrium, and the gases mix instead of remaining stratified: the hot gases (initially at the ceiling) move around the room, and the temperature rises at the ground, which is dangerous for firefighters. An alternative is to cool all the atmosphere by spraying the whole atmosphere as if drawing letters in the air ('penciling'). </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> In such cases, it is necessary to asphyxiate the fire. This can be done in a variety of ways. Chemical products which react with the fuel can be used to stop the combustion. A layer of water-based fire retardant foam can be applied by the fire hose in order to separate the oxygen in the air from the fuel. carbon dioxide, halon, or sodium bicarbonate can be used. In the case of very small fires and in the absence of other extinguishing agents, covering the flame with a fire blanket can eliminate oxygen flow to the fire. A simple and usually effective way to put out a fire in a stove-top pan is to put a lid on the pan and leave it there. Tactical ventilation or isolation of the fire One of the main risks of a fire is the smoke; because, it carries heat and poisonous gases, and obscures vision. In the case of a fire in a closed location (building), the following two different strategies may be used: isolation of the fire or ventilation. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> A carbon dioxide extinguisher or a fire blanket can be used to remove oxygen from the area around the fire. The carbon dioxide extinguisher pulls oxygen away from the fire and replaces it with non-flammable, denser-than-air carbon dioxide. Fire blankets create a barrier around the fire to keep it from getting extra oxygen. Another method of drawing away oxygen would be closing doors during an evacuation of a building. This stops a new supply of oxygen from entering. Heat Heat automatically comes to mind when you think about fire. One of the best ways to weaken and ultimately put out a fire is to reduce its heat. A good example of this would be to blow out the flame of a candle. The candle stops burning when the heat is removed from it by the swiftly moving air. Heat not only increases the likelihood that a fire will start but also helps keep one going by eliminating moisture from fuel sources and warming the surroundings, making it easier for the fire to spread. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> Cooling with water is one of the most typical ways of putting out a fire. The fuel is cooled until it produces insufficient vapor to ignite. The drop in temperature is achieved by applying enough water to create a negative heat balance. Burning will stop if the rate at which heat is produced by combustion is lower than the rate at which heat is lost from the burning substance. The fire may eventually go out if the pace at which heat is lost from it exceeds the rate at which heat is produced. Due to its high thermal capacity, water is an effective cooling agent. This makes it the fire extinguishing chemical that is by far the most extensively used, and it is readily available in enormous amounts. Starving In certain instances, putting out a fire only requires removing the fuel source. There are several ways to do this, including stopping the flow of liquid, removing solid fuel from the fire's path, or letting the fire burn until all the fuel is gone. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Stopping combustion requires depriving the fire of one or more sides of the fire triangle, or by stopping the chemical chain reaction that sustains combustion—and that's how standard fire extinguishing work. It's important to use the right type of agent to extinguish the fire, so we have created an overview of how the most common types of agents work to disrupt the fire triangle/tetrahedron. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and inert gases put out Class B and C fires by removing oxygen from the fire triangle. While inert gases will also put out Class A fires, CO2 can be used for surface Class A fires only. Water-based systems put out Class A fires by removing heat from the fire triangle. Dry powders are available in a few different types, with different applications appropriate for Class A, B, or C fires, work by applying a thin layer of material to separate the fuel from surrounding oxygen, interrupting the chemical chain reaction that keeps a fire going. </p>",2025-11-19 19:25:05-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Heat not only increases the likelihood that a fire will start but also helps keep one going by eliminating moisture from fuel sources and warming the surroundings, making it easier for the fire to spread. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> Cooling with water is one of the most typical ways of putting out a fire. The fuel is cooled until it produces insufficient vapor to ignite. The drop in temperature is achieved by applying enough water to create a negative heat balance. Burning will stop if the rate at which heat is produced by combustion is lower than the rate at which heat is lost from the burning substance. The fire may eventually go out if the pace at which heat is lost from it exceeds the rate at which heat is produced. Due to its high thermal capacity, water is an effective cooling agent. This makes it the fire extinguishing chemical that is by far the most extensively used, and it is readily available in enormous amounts. Starving In certain instances, putting out a fire only requires removing the fuel source. There are several ways to do this, including stopping the flow of liquid, removing solid fuel from the fire's path, or letting the fire burn until all the fuel is gone. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Stopping combustion requires depriving the fire of one or more sides of the fire triangle, or by stopping the chemical chain reaction that sustains combustion—and that's how standard fire extinguishing work. It's important to use the right type of agent to extinguish the fire, so we have created an overview of how the most common types of agents work to disrupt the fire triangle/tetrahedron. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and inert gases put out Class B and C fires by removing oxygen from the fire triangle. While inert gases will also put out Class A fires, CO2 can be used for surface Class A fires only. Water-based systems put out Class A fires by removing heat from the fire triangle. Dry powders are available in a few different types, with different applications appropriate for Class A, B, or C fires, work by applying a thin layer of material to separate the fuel from surrounding oxygen, interrupting the chemical chain reaction that keeps a fire going. </p>",2025-11-19 23:54:36-08:00,False,Response is valid.

It was the first a cappella song to reach number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, a position it held for two weeks. Originally released in conjunction with the film Cocktail, the song peaked at number-one on September 24, 1988, displacing 'Sweet Child o' Mine' by Guns N' Roses. The song also peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart and number seven on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. It hit number one in Australia and stayed there for 7 weeks. It was also a hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number two during its fifth week on the UK Singles Chart. In Canada, the song reached number one in its eighth week. One critic noted it as a 'formula for facing life's trials'. At the 1989 Grammy Awards, 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' won the awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. In 2024, the single was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'. Background Meher Baba, who often used the phrase 'Don't worry, be happy' Indian mystic Meher Baba (1894–1969) often used the expression 'Don't worry, be happy' when cabling his followers in the West, and the expression was printed on inspirational cards and posters during the 1960s. In 1988, McFerrin noticed a similar poster in the apartment of jazz duo Tuck & Patti in San Francisco,[citation needed] and he was inspired by the expression's charm and simplicity. He wrote and recorded the song for his album Simple Pleasures and it was included in the soundtrack of the movie Cocktail, which subsequently led to it becoming a hit single the next year. Composition and recording 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' (2008) A 24-second audio sample of Bobby McFerrin's 'Don't Worry, Be Happy'. Problems playing this file? See media help. The 'instruments' in the a cappella song are entirely overdubbed voice parts and other sounds made by McFerrin, using no instruments at all; McFerrin also sings with an affected accent, though he stated that 'I hate to go so far as to say it's Jamaican. It was heavily influenced by Juan's Mexican Restaurant, which was just around the corner from the studio.' 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' is written in the key of B major. The song was recorded by McFerrin at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California, using only eight tracks. McFerrin sang his vocal parts into his preferred microphone, a Neumann U 87. Critical reception Kieran McCarthy of AllMusic expected that the song would 'probably remain prevalent in pop culture as long as humans speak English and play music.' Pan-European magazine Music & Media picked it as Single of the Week, writing 'Cool a capella by this unusual artist. Uncomplicated music stripped down to the basics, but missing absolutely nothing. This recording will appeal to everybody who is on the lookout for something different. With the reggae-style vocals and a snappy rhythm, this Linda Goldstein produced US top 10 single is a novelty record of considerable substance.' Music video The comedic original music video for the song, directed by Drew Takahashi, stars McFerrin, Robin Williams, and Bill Irwin, and is somewhat shorter than the album version. Awards At the 1989 Grammy Awards, 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' won the awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. Impact and legacy The song is ranked No. 31 on VH1's '100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the '80s' and also appears on Rolling Stone's list of the 15 Best Whistling Songs of All Time. It was featured at #301 in the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment for the Arts' 'Songs of the Century' in 2001. However, in 2011, 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' was named as the worst song of all time by Village Voice critic Michael Musto, and it topped Q100 DJ Bert Weiss's list of tracks he would forever ban from radio. In the '50 Worst Songs Ever', Blender wrote 'it's difficult to think of a song more likely to plunge you into suicidal despondency than this' and it lambasted its 'appalling' lyrics. 400,000‡ United States (RIAA) Gold 500,000^ ^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.

In reaction, McFerrin (a Democrat) publicly protested that particular use of his song, including stating that he was going to vote against Bush, and he completely dropped the song from his own performance repertoire to make the point even clearer.

Six weeks before it topped the Hot 100, Bobby McFerrin's 'Don't Worry Be Happy' became the ultimate left-field #1, 30 years ago this week. The first chart-topper without any instrumentation, it sounded, almost by definition, unlike anything else on the radio. (Haters of UB40's 'Red Red Wine,' which hit #1 a month later, may disagree.) Like 'Kokomo,' 'Don't Worry' was created by the product of a musical family, offered ersatz island flavor, and promised some sort of getaway from modern ills. (As such, it was anathema to Chuck D, who dissed the song in Public Enemy's earthshaking 'Fight The Power.') Unlike the Beach Boys, however, McFerrin essentially declined to attempt a suitable follow-up. Already a Grammy-garlanded jazz musician, he quickly returned to that world rather than, say, guesting on Baywatch. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> It was a phrase popularized by Meher Baba, an Indian spiritual master who had developed a sizable American following prior to his death in 1969. I say 'phrase' and not 'saying' because, in 1925, Meher Baba ceased speaking. 'Don't worry, be happy' was something he would send his Western adherents, and because they were Western, the phrase started appearing on posters and cards. (Wikipedia claims that McFerrin was inspired by one such poster hanging in jazz duo Tuck & Patti's apartment. That lacks a citation, but it's fun to think of think of 'Don't Worry Be Happy' being born in St. Vincent's aunt and uncle's home.) McFerrin reportedly called it 'a pretty neat philosophy in four words,' and he wasn't alone in thinking so. Meher Baba's most famous devotee was the Who's Pete Townshend, who structured an entire rock opera (1969's Tommy) around the man's teachings, and later titled a song after his two heroes: Baba and Terry Riley. Thankfully, the phrase didn't send McFerrin off to write his own 'Underture.' Instead, he created possibly the sunniest song about survival ever written. He tosses out scenarios straight from the blues — no girlfriend, late rent, no cash — and smashes them with optimism straight from the spiritual tradition. By now, McFerrin was an old hand at overdubs, and he fleshed out the simple, lilting topline with a host of embellishments. There's the soothing multi-tracked coos, straight out of doo-wop. There's the infernally catchy whistling that starts the track, and his astounding approximation of a popping bassline. And, of course, there's the vague Jamaican syncopation of his pats and snaps, and the even more vague Caribbean accent he affects — you could make the perverse argument that 'Don't Worry Be Happy' was America's first reggae #1. According to McFerrin's longtime manager and producer Linda Goldstein, he was actually going for a Spanish accent, inspired by a recent viewing of The Three Amigos. True or not, America heard Jamaican — a YouTube upload of the song, credited to Bob Marley, has over 100 million views. Marley never recorded 'Don't Worry Be Happy' — due to dying in 1981, for starters — but you can still find people who swear he performed the song. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> But in 1988 as in 2018, 'Don't Worry Be Happy' sounds like nothing else.

By calling for the complete divestment of funds from the nation the AAM sparked a turning point for the global call to end apartheid. Many organizations both in the U.K..and U.S. called for divestment at the federal, state, and local level as well as in private corporations and the education system. The divestment of funds from any of these sectors would mean a decrease in the value of the South African Rand and the complete destruction of the South African economy, forcing the apartheid regime to rethink their unequal legislation. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The Anti-Apartheid Movement at universities across the United States is where one is able to find some of the most vocal advocates for change. As early as 1977, major universities such as Ohio University, the University of Massachusetts, and Hampshire College had begun to divest funds from apartheid South Africa (ACOA, January 1982). By August 1988 155 universities across the United States had divested from South Africa, a huge spike since 1984, when only 53 universities had joined the cause. This spike in divestment correlates to the passing of the 1986 Anti-Apartheid Act by the US government and the further increase in public awareness to the atrocities occurring in South Africa. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> In a total rejection of apartheid, black South Africans mobilized to make the townships ungovernable, black local officials resigned in droves, and the government declared a State of Emergency in 1985 and used thousands of troops to quell 'unrest'. Television audiences throughout the world were to watch almost nightly reports of massive resistance to apartheid, the growth of a democratic movement, and the savage police and military response. The result of the widely televised South African response was 'a dramatic expansion of international actions to isolate apartheid, actions that combined with the internal situation to force dramatic changes in South Africa's international economic relations'. Higher education endowments Student anti-apartheid activists in the US demanded that their colleges and universities divest from companies that traded or had operations in South Africa, and put pressure on boards of trustees. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> A comprehensive list of the students' demands was published on 28 February 1986. The 'Women at College Hall' agreed to end the blockade if the Board of Trustees agreed to 'issue a statement of intent to deliberate again, with a quorum, the issue of divestment' before Spring Break, and to consider 'a restructuring of the investment policy'. Students also demanded that a teach-in be conducted to educate the college and the Board of Trustees on divestment and South African apartheid. On 1 March 1986, the protest ended when administrators agreed that the trustees would re-evaluate their decision, a mandatory teach-in would be held, and amnesty would be granted to anyone involved in the sit-in and blockade. As a result of student pressure, by 31 October 1988 Smith College had divested all $39 million in stocks that they held in companies working in South Africa. Harvard University </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The capital flight triggered a dramatic decline in the international exchange rate of the South African rand. The currency decline made imports more expensive, and this in turn caused inflation in South Africa to rise at a steep 12–15% per year. The South African government attempted to restrict the damaging outflow of capital. Knight writes that 'in September 1985 it imposed a system of exchange control and a debt repayments standstill. Under exchange control, South African residents are generally prohibited from removing capital from the country and foreign investors can only remove investments via the financial rand, which is traded at a 20% to 40% discount compared to the commercial rand. This means companies that disinvest get significantly fewer dollars for the capital they withdraw.' Criticism of disinvestment Within South Africa there was opposition to disinvestment among both black and white political leaders. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Chief Minister of KwaZulu and president of the Inkatha Freedom Party, slammed sanctions, stating that 'They can only harm all the people of Southern Africa. They can only lead to more hardships, particularly for the blacks.' The Members of Parliament Helen Suzman and Harry Schwarz, who opposed apartheid and were leaders of the Progressive Federal Party, also argued that disinvestment would cause further economic hardships for black people and that this would ultimately worsen the political climate for negotiations. Suzman said that such sanctions are 'self-defeating, wrecking the economy and do not assist anybody irrespective of race'. Schwarz said, 'Morality is cheap when someone else is paying.' </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> On May 9, 1994, Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid activist, released from prison only four years prior, was democratically elected the president of South Africa. Mandela's historic presidency would never have been possible during the time of apartheid—the end of which was, in part, achieved through protest divestment. Protest divestment is a form of dissent in which stockholders intentionally sell their assets from a corporation to enact social change. By selling off stocks, protesters hope to influence corporations against performing some aspect of their business. In this case, those opposed to apartheid wanted to keep companies from doing business in South Africa. In this article, we will explore protest divestment in South Africa to show how the simple act of selling a stock can affect real social change. Understanding Divestment Anti-apartheid protests took hold in the 1960s, particularly on the campuses of American colleges and universities. Initially, protesters wanted to end apartheid, but there were not many ways to influence the South African government using the traditional forms of protest such as picketing or demonstrations. Eventually, members of the college-based anti-apartheid movement thought of a more practical way to enact change by pressuring their universities to divest stocks of companies doing business in the country. Many students brought attention to their cause by building shanties on their own campuses to represent the living conditions many oppressed South Africans faced daily. Schools use a certain percentage of their endowment funds as an investment tool, and many schools have quite a large endowment fund. By 2021, more than 107 US schools had endowments of more than $1 billion, giving them an incredible amount of purchasing power. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> While there were strong arguments against divestment, many students continued their protests. Eventually, college administrators saw it the students' way. The first school to agree to divest its portfolio of companies doing business in South Africa was Hampshire College. By 1988, a total of 155 colleges had at least partially divested. While the roots of the divestment movement took hold in America's college campuses, other large entities also soon sold their stocks.

Today, we are gonna answer a question that keeps popping up wherever we look, and it is about Hope Brady's mom. If you're enjoying seeing her back on Days, you're not the only one. Fans are thrilled to have Kristian Alfonso back. But her and Bo Brady's return has prompted a bunch of questions about her past that some fans have forgotten. We're gonna dig into that. Now, let's dig into one of the most common questions about the legacy character… One that we keep seeing right now all over the place, and that is, who was Hope Brady's mother on Days of our Lives? If you don't remember, here's a little slice of history for you. We promise we'll keep it hot and interesting. Her mother's name was Adelaide Horton Williams. She was commonly known as Addie Horton. She was played by both Patricia Huston and Patricia Barry way, way, way back in the days, we're talking pre-1970s, 60s era. If you know Salem Town Square, you know it's Horton Square, named for Tom and Alice Horton. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> Now, the big question is, since Julie is married to Hope's dad, what happened to mom, Addie? When Hope was newborn, she was a newborn being pushed around in a baby carriage. And there was a car about to hit the baby carriage. So, her mom, Addie, intervened and threw herself in front of the baby stroller and was struck by the car instead. And those injuries killed her. She died in the spring of 1974, not long after her little girl was born. So, Hope never really knew her mother. And that was obviously a tiny actress then on Days of our Lives. Now, Hope Brady's mom, Adelaide Horton Williams, has been dead for decades. Not long after his wife's death, Doug married Julie, his former stepdaughter. And the young girl was then shipped off to boarding school. Hope Came Back Grown from Boarding School on Days of our Lives Hope Brady returned as a gorgeous young adult in the eighties to huge storylines. They did a whole SORAS recast (Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome. Then, with Kristian Alfonso in the role, we got the big romance of Hope Williams and Bo Brady. They were star-crossed lovers that became a super couple. You know, they were on and off like all big couples on all soap operas. But that came to an end a decade ago when Bo Brady died of complications of brain cancer. However, Days of our Lives has now done a retcon and changed that. We know they love resurrections. Salem should be full of zombies by now, with as many dead people as they've brought back. So, Bo was dead for a decade, but Megan Hathaway kept him in cold storage and then revived him. Of course, Megan's another who's supposed to be dead. Fans cheered at the return of Kristian Alfonso and Peter Reckell coming back to Days of our Lives, but we have some bad news about their return. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Hope Brady is one of the most popular characters to ever appear on 'Days of Our Lives.' The character, played by Kristian Alfonso until 2020, has seemingly been through it all. In 1983 the character of Hope Williams was aged into a young adult and she was quickly paired with Bo Brady (Peter Reckell) for a romantic relationship (via Soap Central). Fans immediately fell in love with Bo and Hope as a couple, and over the years they cemented themselves as one of the best daytime soap couples of all time (via We Love Soaps).

Today, we are gonna answer a question that keeps popping up wherever we look, and it is about Hope Brady's mom. If you're enjoying seeing her back on Days, you're not the only one. Fans are thrilled to have Kristian Alfonso back. But her and Bo Brady's return has prompted a bunch of questions about her past that some fans have forgotten. We're gonna dig into that. Now, let's dig into one of the most common questions about the legacy character… One that we keep seeing right now all over the place, and that is, who was Hope Brady's mother on Days of our Lives? If you don't remember, here's a little slice of history for you. We promise we'll keep it hot and interesting. Her mother's name was Adelaide Horton Williams. She was commonly known as Addie Horton. She was played by both Patricia Huston and Patricia Barry way, way, way back in the days, we're talking pre-1970s, 60s era. If you know Salem Town Square, you know it's Horton Square, named for Tom and Alice Horton. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> Now, the big question is, since Julie is married to Hope's dad, what happened to mom, Addie? When Hope was newborn, she was a newborn being pushed around in a baby carriage. And there was a car about to hit the baby carriage. So, her mom, Addie, intervened and threw herself in front of the baby stroller and was struck by the car instead. And those injuries killed her. She died in the spring of 1974, not long after her little girl was born. So, Hope never really knew her mother. And that was obviously a tiny actress then on Days of our Lives. Now, Hope Brady's mom, Adelaide Horton Williams, has been dead for decades. Not long after his wife's death, Doug married Julie, his former stepdaughter. And the young girl was then shipped off to boarding school. Hope Came Back Grown from Boarding School on Days of our Lives Hope Brady returned as a gorgeous young adult in the eighties to huge storylines. They did a whole SORAS recast (Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome. Then, with Kristian Alfonso in the role, we got the big romance of Hope Williams and Bo Brady. They were star-crossed lovers that became a super couple. You know, they were on and off like all big couples on all soap operas. But that came to an end a decade ago when Bo Brady died of complications of brain cancer. However, Days of our Lives has now done a retcon and changed that. We know they love resurrections. Salem should be full of zombies by now, with as many dead people as they've brought back. So, Bo was dead for a decade, but Megan Hathaway kept him in cold storage and then revived him. Of course, Megan's another who's supposed to be dead. Fans cheered at the return of Kristian Alfonso and Peter Reckell coming back to Days of our Lives, but we have some bad news about their return. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Hope Brady is one of the most popular characters to ever appear on 'Days of Our Lives.'

Explain to a third-grader: what state does rick and morty take place in,ETA3G,"""Back in 2016 while answering a question from a fan, series co-creator Justin Roiland said that the family lives outside of Seattle, putting them in Washington state.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> This sort of oversight would be inexcusable for any other show, but on Rick and Morty it makes complete sense. Often Rick, Morty, Summer, Beth, and Jerry are so invested in the sci-fi saga of the week that they rarely have time to maintain their Earth relationships. That doesn't leave much room for conversations about local politics or regional weather differences. Here's everything you need to know about where Rick and Morty is set. Where Do Rick and Morty Live? Here's the fun thing about Rick Sanchez and the Smith family: They never specifically say where they live. Back in 2016 while answering a question from a fan, series co-creator Justin Roiland said that the family lives outside of Seattle, putting them in Washington state. That's been confirmed by the show's wiki page. It also explains all of the huge pine trees Jerry grabs onto in 'Rattlestar Ricklatica.' More On: Rick and Morty </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Rick and Morty is an American animated science-fiction comedy franchise, whose eponymous duo consists of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith. Rick and Morty were created by cartoonist Justin Roiland for a 2006 parody film of Back to the Future for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Dan Harmon. After six years, the sketch was developed into Rick and Morty, a half-hour prime time show that was a hit for Adult Swim, receiving universal acclaim across all seasons. Alongside the original television series, the characters of the show have been featured in a variety of media, including spin-offs, comic books, musical releases and video games. The show has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in income across their merchandising and media franchise. The series centers on the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures, with the characters traveling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying car. Different versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the show's multiverse and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The Rick and Morty franchise has received widespread critical acclaim, winning two Annie and Emmy Awards. Background Creation Justin Roiland conceived of the idea for Rick and Morty as an evolution of his 2006 short film parody series The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, inspired by Back to the Future and Scud: The Disposable Assassin, the latter series of which future Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon had written for. Themes Dan Harmon has described Rick and Morty as 'a never-ending fart joke wrapped around a studied look into nihilism'. The formula of the series consists of juxtapositioning two conflicting scenarios: an extremely selfish, alcoholic grandfather dragging his grandson along for interdimensional adventures, intercut with domestic family drama, while addressing the insignificance of human existence as compared to the size of the universe, with no recognizable divine presence, as described by H. P. Lovecraft's philosophy of cosmicism. The characters of the series deal with existential dread and cosmic horror, either by asserting the utility of science over magic or by choosing a life in ignorant bliss. However, as Joachim Heijndermans of Geeks notes, none of the characters appear able to handle the absurd and chaotic nature of the universe, as Jerry gets by through denial while Rick is a 'depressed, substance-addicted, suicidal mess'. Harmon describes the titular Rick Sanchez as a self-interested anarchist, who doesn't like being told what to do. He believes that the character's life on a larger scale has caused him mental illness, and opines that 'the knowledge that nothing matters—while accurate—gets you nowhere'. Matthew Bulger of The Humanist noted that the creators of the series were trying to communicate the message that we need to focus on human relationships and not preoccupy our minds with unanswerable questions, in order to find a sense of purpose and live a better life. Eric Armstrong of The New Republic notes that Morty represents the audience, as he is 'mostly there to react to Rick's deranged schemes'. The character is transformed by the truths he discovers during his interdimensional adventures with his grandfather. However, instead of sinking into depression, Morty accepts these truths that empower him to value his own life. Occasionally, characters will acknowledge an episode's narrative or hint at the presence of a fourth wall, suggesting that they are aware of the fact that they are characters of a television series. Thereunder, Troy Patterson of The New Yorker notes that Rick and Morty 'supplies an artful answer to the question of what follows postmodernism: a decadent regurgitation of all its tropes, all at once, leavened by some humanistic wistfulness.' Sean Sebastian of Junkee says that the show can be both hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time as it excels at the 'intersection between big ideas, flippancy and wit.' Main characters See also: List of Rick and Morty characters The main characters of the show are the members of the Smith household, which consists of parents Jerry and Beth, their children Summer and Morty, and Beth's father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with them as a guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of Seattle, Washington. Richard 'Rick' Sanchez, voiced by Justin Roiland,(season 1-season 6), Ian Cardoni (season 7-present) is a sociopathic, nihilistic, narcissistic, self-centered, alcoholic mad scientist who is the father of Beth Smith and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer. One of Rick's interdimensional counterparts, Rick Prime, serves as the main antagonist of the series. Roiland considers his voice for Rick to be a 'horrible Doc Brown manic impression'. Mortimer 'Morty' Smith Sr., voiced by Justin Roiland, (season 1-season 6), Harry Belden (season 7-present) is Rick's neurotic 14-year-old grandson, son of Jerry and Beth Smith and younger brother of Summer Smith, who is frequently dragged into Rick's misadventures.

More On: Rick and Morty </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Rick and Morty is an American animated science-fiction comedy franchise, whose eponymous duo consists of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith. Rick and Morty were created by cartoonist Justin Roiland for a 2006 parody film of Back to the Future for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Dan Harmon. After six years, the sketch was developed into Rick and Morty, a half-hour prime time show that was a hit for Adult Swim, receiving universal acclaim across all seasons. Alongside the original television series, the characters of the show have been featured in a variety of media, including spin-offs, comic books, musical releases and video games. The show has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in income across their merchandising and media franchise. The series centers on the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures, with the characters traveling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying car. Different versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the show's multiverse and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The Rick and Morty franchise has received widespread critical acclaim, winning two Annie and Emmy Awards. Background Creation Justin Roiland conceived of the idea for Rick and Morty as an evolution of his 2006 short film parody series The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, inspired by Back to the Future and Scud: The Disposable Assassin, the latter series of which future Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon had written for. Themes Dan Harmon has described Rick and Morty as 'a never-ending fart joke wrapped around a studied look into nihilism'. The formula of the series consists of juxtapositioning two conflicting scenarios: an extremely selfish, alcoholic grandfather dragging his grandson along for interdimensional adventures, intercut with domestic family drama, while addressing the insignificance of human existence as compared to the size of the universe, with no recognizable divine presence, as described by H. P. Lovecraft's philosophy of cosmicism. The characters of the series deal with existential dread and cosmic horror, either by asserting the utility of science over magic or by choosing a life in ignorant bliss.

Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (42), a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored. Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by the Guinness World Records. Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions. As of March 2023,[update] Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million. After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by 'mutual agreement'. On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as 'La Décima' (Spanish: 'The Tenth,' [la ˈðeθima]). Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals. After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, 'If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, 'We must start again from zero.' After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season. In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals. Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012. Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals, several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015. Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as 'La Duodécima'. The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season. Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season. On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy. In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's 'need for change' as his rationale for departing. Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history, and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage. Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Real Madrid has had the most success in the European Cup, winning the trophy for a record fifteen times.

Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by the Guinness World Records. Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions. As of March 2023,[update] Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million. After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by 'mutual agreement'. On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as 'La Décima' (Spanish: 'The Tenth,' [la ˈðeθima]). Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals. After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, 'If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, 'We must start again from zero.' After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season. In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.

","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Director's cuts of film are not generally released to the public because on most films the director does not have the final cut privilege. Those with money invested in the film, such as the production companies, distributors, or studios, may make changes intended to make the film more profitable at the box office. This sometimes means a happier ending or less ambiguity, or excluding scenes that would earn a more audience-restricting rating, but more often means that the film is simply shortened to provide more screenings per day. With the rise of home video, the phrase became more generically used as a marketing term (including media such as comic books and music albums, neither of which actually have directors), and the most commonly seen form of director's cut is a cut where extra scenes and characters are added in, often making the director's cut considerably longer than the final cut. Origin of the phrase Traditionally, the 'director's cut' is not, by definition, the director's ideal or preferred cut. The editing process of a film is broken into stages: First is the assembly/rough cut, where all selected takes are put together in the order in which they should appear in the film. Next, the editor's cut is reduced from the rough cut; the editor may be guided by their own choices or following notes from the director or producers. Eventually is the final cut, which actually gets released or broadcast. In between the editor's cut and the final cut can come any number of fine cuts, including the director's cut. The director's cut may include unsatisfactory takes, a preliminary soundtrack, a lack of desired pick-up shots etc., which the director would not like to be shown but uses as a placeholder until satisfactory replacements can be inserted. This is still how the term is used within the film industry, as well as commercials, television, and music videos. Inception The trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the 'director's cut' of The Wild Bunch was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences. The theatrical release of the film had cut 10 minutes to get an R rating, but this cut was hailed as superior and has now become the definitive one. Other early examples include George Lucas's first two films being re-released following the success of Star Wars, in cuts which more closely resembled his vision, or Peter Bogdanovich re-cutting The Last Picture Show several times. Charlie Chaplin also re-released all of his films in the 1970s, several of which were re-cut (Chaplin's re-release of The Gold Rush in the 1940s is almost certainly the earliest prominent example of a director's re-cut film being released to the public). A theatrical re-release of Close Encounters of the Third Kind used the phrase 'Special Edition' to describe a cut which was closer to Spielberg's intent but had a compromised ending demanded by the studio. As the home video industry rose in the early 1980s, video releases of director's cuts were sometimes created for the small but dedicated cult fan market. Los Angeles cable station Z Channel is also cited as significant in the popularization of alternate cuts. Early examples of films released in this manner include Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, where a longer cut was recalled from theatres but subsequently shown on cable and eventually released to home video; James Cameron's Aliens, where a video release restored 20 minutes the studio had insisted on cutting; Cameron also voluntarily made cuts to the theatrical version of The Abyss for pacing but restored them for a video release, and most famously, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, where an alternate workprint version was released to fan acclaim, ultimately resulting in the 1992 recut. Scott later recut the film once more, releasing a version dubbed 'The Final Cut' in 2007.

Final cut on a movie means that no matter what, the director gets to say what is released. Very few people in Hollywood have this. Most times, the studio will release their version, and then much later either on Blu-ray or digital, the director will release their version. That's where the director's cut comes into play. But what is the definition of a director's cut? And how does it happen in Hollywood? Today we're going to define that term, look at a few examples, and talk about how directors get their vision to the audience. 'Aliens'Credit: 20th Century Fox What Is a Director's Cut? (Definition and Examples) These are important terms to know if you want to work in Hollywood. Let's dig deep into definitions before we get into the examples. Director's Cut Definition A director's cut is a version of a film that represents the director's own approved edit. A director's cut may include scenes that were not in the theatrical cut of the movie, which was altered by the studio for time or content. What Does the Director's Cut Mean? It means that this version of a film has been edited in exact accordance with the director's wishes. They have decided on the order of scenes, cuts, and length, without any interference from producers or studios. Maybe scenes that got cut from the theatrical release get added back to the director's cut. Where did Director's Cut come from? According to Wikipedia, 'The trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the 'director's cut' of The Wild Bunch was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences.' It evolved from there with directors and studios battling it out over the decades. What Is Final Cut? Final cut means that a director takes on a project knowing they will be allowed to release the director's cut to the public without interference. If a director has a final cut, there can be no fight with the studio over what goes into the movie. Only their say matters. Credit: Warner Bros. What Is the Difference Between a Theatrical Cut and Director's Cut? The theatrical cut of a movie is what the studio has decided to release to theaters. Sometimes, but not every time, the producers or studio will create their own edit to change a director's vision. They may cut out sex, violence, or just trim movies for time, so they can show more often. The director's cut means that the director chose what cut is on the screen. What's Different Between the Director's Cut and the Extended Cut? An extended cut of a movie might add scenes cut for rating or time. They are often released by the studio to capitalize on a big title, like a comedy, where more outrageous scenes could be added. If the director wanted them added in, then they would be in the director's cut. Lots of times, extended cuts are made without the director, unless specifically advertised. Something like The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition was made with director Peter Jackson, and it bridges the gap between extended and director's cut. Credit: New Line CinemaDirector's Cut Examples There are lots of examples of director's cuts out there. One that comes to mind immediately is that of Blade Runner, which Ridley Scott famously keeps releasing director's cuts of, as he goes back and tweaks voiceover, dream sequences, and lots of other nuances. Scott also released a far superior director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven, which turned the average film into a masterpiece. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Main differences from Blade Runner's many cutsDirector's Cut TypesDifferent types of Director's CutsEver since DVDs and Blu-rays became the norm, Director's Cuts are now a regular part of the home video business.

Director's Cut Definition A director's cut is a version of a film that represents the director's own approved edit. A director's cut may include scenes that were not in the theatrical cut of the movie, which was altered by the studio for time or content. What Does the Director's Cut Mean? It means that this version of a film has been edited in exact accordance with the director's wishes. They have decided on the order of scenes, cuts, and length, without any interference from producers or studios. Maybe scenes that got cut from the theatrical release get added back to the director's cut. Where did Director's Cut come from? According to Wikipedia, 'The trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the 'director's cut' of The Wild Bunch was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences.' It evolved from there with directors and studios battling it out over the decades. What Is Final Cut? Final cut means that a director takes on a project knowing they will be allowed to release the director's cut to the public without interference. If a director has a final cut, there can be no fight with the studio over what goes into the movie. Only their say matters. Credit: Warner Bros. What Is the Difference Between a Theatrical Cut and Director's Cut? The theatrical cut of a movie is what the studio has decided to release to theaters. Sometimes, but not every time, the producers or studio will create their own edit to change a director's vision. They may cut out sex, violence, or just trim movies for time, so they can show more often. The director's cut means that the director chose what cut is on the screen. What's Different Between the Director's Cut and the Extended Cut? An extended cut of a movie might add scenes cut for rating or time. They are often released by the studio to capitalize on a big title, like a comedy, where more outrageous scenes could be added. If the director wanted them added in, then they would be in the director's cut. Lots of times, extended cuts are made without the director, unless specifically advertised. Something like The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition was made with director Peter Jackson, and it bridges the gap between extended and director's cut. Credit: New Line CinemaDirector's Cut Examples There are lots of examples of director's cuts out there. One that comes to mind immediately is that of Blade Runner, which Ridley Scott famously keeps releasing director's cuts of, as he goes back and tweaks voiceover, dream sequences, and lots of other nuances. Scott also released a far superior director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven, which turned the average film into a masterpiece. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Main differences from Blade Runner's many cutsDirector's Cut TypesDifferent types of Director's CutsEver since DVDs and Blu-rays became the norm, Director's Cuts are now a regular part of the home video business.

A director's cut may include scenes that were not in the theatrical cut of the movie, which was altered by the studio for time or content"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Director's cuts of film are not generally released to the public because on most films the director does not have the final cut privilege. Those with money invested in the film, such as the production companies, distributors, or studios, may make changes intended to make the film more profitable at the box office. This sometimes means a happier ending or less ambiguity, or excluding scenes that would earn a more audience-restricting rating, but more often means that the film is simply shortened to provide more screenings per day. With the rise of home video, the phrase became more generically used as a marketing term (including media such as comic books and music albums, neither of which actually have directors), and the most commonly seen form of director's cut is a cut where extra scenes and characters are added in, often making the director's cut considerably longer than the final cut. Origin of the phrase Traditionally, the 'director's cut' is not, by definition, the director's ideal or preferred cut. The editing process of a film is broken into stages: First is the assembly/rough cut, where all selected takes are put together in the order in which they should appear in the film. Next, the editor's cut is reduced from the rough cut; the editor may be guided by their own choices or following notes from the director or producers. Eventually is the final cut, which actually gets released or broadcast. In between the editor's cut and the final cut can come any number of fine cuts, including the director's cut. The director's cut may include unsatisfactory takes, a preliminary soundtrack, a lack of desired pick-up shots etc., which the director would not like to be shown but uses as a placeholder until satisfactory replacements can be inserted. This is still how the term is used within the film industry, as well as commercials, television, and music videos. Inception The trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the 'director's cut' of The Wild Bunch was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences. The theatrical release of the film had cut 10 minutes to get an R rating, but this cut was hailed as superior and has now become the definitive one. Other early examples include George Lucas's first two films being re-released following the success of Star Wars, in cuts which more closely resembled his vision, or Peter Bogdanovich re-cutting The Last Picture Show several times. Charlie Chaplin also re-released all of his films in the 1970s, several of which were re-cut (Chaplin's re-release of The Gold Rush in the 1940s is almost certainly the earliest prominent example of a director's re-cut film being released to the public). A theatrical re-release of Close Encounters of the Third Kind used the phrase 'Special Edition' to describe a cut which was closer to Spielberg's intent but had a compromised ending demanded by the studio. As the home video industry rose in the early 1980s, video releases of director's cuts were sometimes created for the small but dedicated cult fan market. Los Angeles cable station Z Channel is also cited as significant in the popularization of alternate cuts. Early examples of films released in this manner include Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, where a longer cut was recalled from theatres but subsequently shown on cable and eventually released to home video; James Cameron's Aliens, where a video release restored 20 minutes the studio had insisted on cutting; Cameron also voluntarily made cuts to the theatrical version of The Abyss for pacing but restored them for a video release, and most famously, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, where an alternate workprint version was released to fan acclaim, ultimately resulting in the 1992 recut. Scott later recut the film once more, releasing a version dubbed 'The Final Cut' in 2007. This was the final re-cut and the first in which Scott maintained creative control over the final product, leading to The Final Cut being considered the definitive version of the film. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Separate to director's cuts are alternate cuts released as 'special editions' or 'extended cuts'. These versions are often put together for home video for fans, and should not be confused with 'director's cuts'. For example, despite releasing extended versions of his The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson told IGN in 2019 that 'the theatrical versions are the definitive versions, I regard the extended cuts as being a novelty for the fans that really want to see the extra material.' 'The traditional definition of the term 'Director's Cut' suggests the restoration of a director's original vision, free of any creative limitations. It suggests that the filmmaker has finally overcome the interference of heavy-handed studio executives, and that the film has been restored to its original, untampered form. Such is not the case with Alien: The Director's Cut. It's a completely different beast.' —Ridley Scott </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Making a movie is no easy feat. You go in with the best intentions, but the more money you spend on the movie, the more people you have to answer to. If you're working for a studio or a lot of independent producers, chances are you'll have to compromise your vision. Unless you are entitled to make a director's cut. Final cut on a movie means that no matter what, the director gets to say what is released. Very few people in Hollywood have this. Most times, the studio will release their version, and then much later either on Blu-ray or digital, the director will release their version. That's where the director's cut comes into play.

United States president Abraham Lincoln—under pressure from the public that urged the army 'On to Richmond!'—went against the advice of his aging general-in-chief Winfield Scott and ordered an attack. Largely untrained Union troops under Irvin McDowell marched to Centreville and then to Manassas Junction, where McDowell hoped to cut the railroad running into the Shenandoah Valley. He failed, and Confederate troops (equally untrained) under Joseph E. Johnston rode the rails from the Valley to Manassas, where they united with P. G. T. Beauregard's army and met McDowell along Bull Run on July 21. The battle was marked by confusion, with Union and Confederate troops wearing similar uniforms and flying similar flags. When it looked as if the Union troops might prevail, Virginians under the command of Thomas J. Jackson rallied on Henry House Hill, where he earned his famous nickname 'Stonewall.' The Union army was routed in front of spectators from Washington, D.C., and politicians and generals on both sides were left to acknowledge the possibility that the war would last longer than they had thought. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> See all results Breadcrumb Home Learn Civil War Bull Run My Library Bull RunFirst ManassasShock and Awe at Bull Run: War DepartmentClose Video Also offered in: Español Fairfax County and Prince William County, VA  |  Jul 21, 1861 Bull Run was the first full-scale battle of the Civil War.

The Confederates under Beauregard, equally green, are positioned behind Bull Run Creek west of Centreville. They aim to block the Union army advance on the Confederate capital by defending the railroad junction at Manassas, just west of the creek. The railroads there connect the strategically important Shenandoah Valley with the Virginia interior. Another Confederate army under Gen. Joseph E. Johnston operates in the Valley and is poised to reinforce Beauregard. McDowell's plan is to make quick work of Beauregard's force before Johnston can join him. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> On July 18, McDowell's army reached Centreville.

McDowell first attempted to move toward the Confederate right flank, but his troops were checked at Blackburn's Ford. He then spent the next two days scouting the Southern left flank. In the meantime, Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army, stationed in the Shenandoah Valley with 10,000 Confederate troops, were ordered to support Beauregard.

Meanwhile, McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support. Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across 300 yards (270 m) against Jackson's 13. Unlike many engagements in the Civil War, here the Confederate artillery had an advantage. The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges, with many shots fired over the head of their targets.

United States president Abraham Lincoln—under pressure from the public that urged the army 'On to Richmond!'—went against the advice of his aging general-in-chief Winfield Scott and ordered an attack. Largely untrained Union troops under Irvin McDowell marched to Centreville and then to Manassas Junction, where McDowell hoped to cut the railroad running into the Shenandoah Valley. He failed, and Confederate troops (equally untrained) under Joseph E. Johnston rode the rails from the Valley to Manassas, where they united with P. G. T. Beauregard's army and met McDowell along Bull Run on July 21. The battle was marked by confusion, with Union and Confederate troops wearing similar uniforms and flying similar flags. When it looked as if the Union troops might prevail, Virginians under the command of Thomas J. Jackson rallied on Henry House Hill, where he earned his famous nickname 'Stonewall.' The Union army was routed in front of spectators from Washington, D.C., and politicians and generals on both sides were left to acknowledge the possibility that the war would last longer than they had thought. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> See all results Breadcrumb Home Learn Civil War Bull Run My Library Bull RunFirst ManassasShock and Awe at Bull Run: War DepartmentClose Video Also offered in: Español Fairfax County and Prince William County, VA  |  Jul 21, 1861 Bull Run was the first full-scale battle of the Civil War.

After this stinging defeat for the Union, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, the commander of the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia, was relieved and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B.

The Confederates under Beauregard, equally green, are positioned behind Bull Run Creek west of Centreville. They aim to block the Union army advance on the Confederate capital by defending the railroad junction at Manassas, just west of the creek. The railroads there connect the strategically important Shenandoah Valley with the Virginia interior. Another Confederate army under Gen. Joseph E. Johnston operates in the Valley and is poised to reinforce Beauregard. McDowell's plan is to make quick work of Beauregard's force before Johnston can join him. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> On July 18, McDowell's army reached Centreville. Five miles ahead a small meandering stream named Bull Run crossed the route of the Union advance. Guarding the fords from Union Mills to the Stone Bridge were 22,000 Southern troops under the command of Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard. McDowell first attempted to move toward the Confederate right flank, but his troops were checked at Blackburn's Ford. He then spent the next two days scouting the Southern left flank. In the meantime, Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army, stationed in the Shenandoah Valley with 10,000 Confederate troops, were ordered to support Beauregard. Johnston gave an opposing Union army the slip and, employing the Manassas Gap Railroad, started his brigades toward Manassas Junction, with most arriving July 20 and 21.

After a Confederate artillery fired on Fort Sumter in April, members of Congress complained about the Union army's inactivity. They traded rumors that President Abraham Lincoln was delaying military action in order to forge a compromise with the South. They demanded a quick campaign to prevent the Confederate Congress from convening in Richmond.

Indian Rebellion of 1857 is one of the first major uprisings against the British government or the British East India Company which during that time acted as a sovereign power as a representative of the British Crown. Q 2. What are the causes of the revolt of 1867? Answer- The discrimination that the lower cast people faced in the east Indian company army. The army practices various higher cast rituals and took measures to segregate the people based on caste. With the increasing expansion plans of the British Government, there was a scope that the power of Nawabs and Zamindars in various places will be reduced or completely taken away. Q 3.

Later, a large-scale rebellion broke out in May and turned into what may be called a full-fledged war in the affected region. This war brought about the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to the direct rule by the British Government (British Raj) of much of the Indian Subcontinent for the next 90 years. </p>",2025-11-20 09:49:21-08:00,False,Response is valid.

This year it was different. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> With India's population being pegged at 1.2 billion as of May 2016, applying this benchmark, India should have approximately 60,000 judges. As on 1 January 2016, according to Court News, a publication of the Supreme Court of India, there were 16,119 judges in the subordinate judiciary, 598 in high courts and 26 in the Supreme Court. The latest figures (as on 11 July 2016), as seen from the National Judicial Data Grid and Department of Justice data, tell us that there are 16,438 judges at the subordinate judiciary level, 621 in high courts and 29 in the Supreme Court. All of this suggests that getting anywhere close to CJI's benchmark of 70,000 or even 65,000 is going to be a herculean, if not impossible, task in the next few decades. However, a fundamental question needs to be answered: Do we actually need 70,000 judges to dispose of the pending 32 million cases in the Indian judicial system? The numbers suggest otherwise. For a start, even with the present strength, courts dispose of almost as many cases as are filed in a given year. For instance, between July 2014 and July 2015, with a working strength of between 15,500 and 15,600 judges, the subordinate courts in India disposed of about 18,730,046 cases as against 18,625,038 cases which were filed in the same period—just a little more than the number of cases filed. This must give us pause to question once again the basis for the figure of 70,000 judges. The Law Commission's methodology The origin of the benchmark of '50 judges per million' lies in the 120th report of the Law Commission of India. That report itself is very laconic. It is all of five pages long. While it suggests rate of pendency or rate of litigation as a basis to fix judges' strength, it doesn't actually carry out the mathematical exercise of arriving at a number on the basis of available data. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The Supreme Court of India is the apex judicial body under the Constitution of India.

Curl writes all cookies from its in-memory cookie storage to the given file at the end of operations. Even if no cookies are known, a file is created so that it removes any formerly existing cookies from the file. The file uses the Netscape cookie file format. If you set the filename to a single minus, '-', the cookies are written to stdout. The file specified with -c, --cookie-jar is only used for output. No cookies are read from the file. To read cookies, use the -b, --cookie option. Both options can specify the same file. This command line option activates the cookie engine that makes curl record and use cookies. The -b, --cookie option also activates it. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Specifies which DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server to use to resolve hostnames, instead of using the default name resolver mechanism. The URL must be HTTPS. Some SSL options that you set for your transfer also applies to DoH since the name lookups take place over SSL. However, the certificate verification settings are not inherited but are controlled separately via --doh-insecure and --doh-cert-status. This option is unset if an empty string '' is used as the URL. (Added in 7.85.0) If --doh-url is provided several times, the last set value is used. Example: curl --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com See also --doh-insecure.

Particularly useful when wanting to issue HTTP requests without leading slash or other data that does not follow the regular URL pattern, like 'OPTIONS *'. curl passes on the verbatim string you give it its the request without any filter or other safe guards. That includes white space and control characters. If --request-target is provided several times, the last set value is used.

The output following that instruction is then written to that file. More than one %output{} instruction can be specified in the same write-out argument. If the filename cannot be created, curl leaves the output destination to the one used prior to the %output{} instruction. Use %output{&gt;&gt;name} to append data to an existing file.

FTP is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a plain-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The first FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems. Many dedicated FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been incorporated into productivity applications such as HTML editors and file managers. An FTP client used to be commonly integrated in web browsers, where file servers are browsed with the URI prefix 'ftp://'. In 2021, FTP support was dropped by Google Chrome and Firefox, two major web browser vendors, due to it being superseded by the more secure SFTP and FTPS; although neither of them have implemented the newer protocols. History of FTP servers </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> FTP may run in active or passive mode, which determines how the data connection is established. (This sense of 'mode' is different from that of the MODE command in the FTP protocol.) In active mode, the client starts listening for incoming data connections from the server on port M. It sends the FTP command PORT M to inform the server on which port it is listening. The server then initiates a data channel to the client from its port 20, the FTP server data port. In situations where the client is behind a firewall and unable to accept incoming TCP connections, passive mode may be used. In this mode, the client uses the control connection to send a PASV command to the server and then receives a server IP address and server port number from the server, which the client then uses to open a data connection from an arbitrary client port to the server IP address and server port number received. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> FTP login uses normal username and password scheme for granting access. The username is sent to the server using the USER command, and the password is sent using the PASS command. This sequence is unencrypted 'on the wire', so may be vulnerable to a network sniffing attack. If the information provided by the client is accepted by the server, the server will send a greeting to the client and the session will commence. If the server supports it, users may log in without providing login credentials, but the same server may authorize only limited access for such sessions. Anonymous FTP </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> For a long time, most common web browsers were able to retrieve files hosted on FTP servers, although not all of them had support for protocol extensions such as FTPS. When an FTP—rather than an HTTP—URL is supplied, the accessible contents on the remote server are presented in a manner that is similar to that used for other web content. Google Chrome removed FTP support entirely in Chrome 88, also affecting other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge. Firefox 88 disabled FTP support by default, with Firefox 90 dropping support entirely. FireFTP is a discontinued browser extension that was designed as a full-featured FTP client to be run within Firefox, but when Firefox dropped support for FTP the extension developer recommended using Waterfox. Some browsers, such as the text-based Lynx, still support FTP. Syntax FTP URL syntax is described in RFC 1738, taking the form: ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/[url-path] (the bracketed parts are optional). For example, the URL ftp://public.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt represents the file myfile.txt from the directory mydirectory on the server public.ftp-servers.example.com as an FTP resource. The URL ftp://user001:secretpassword@private.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt adds a specification of the username and password that must be used to access this resource. More details on specifying a username and password may be found in the browsers' documentation (e.g., Firefox and Internet Explorer). By default, most web browsers use passive (PASV) mode, which more easily traverses end-user firewalls. Some variation has existed in how different browsers treat path resolution in cases where there is a non-root home directory for a user.

Explain to a third-grader: who wrote shes always a woman to me,ETA3G,"""Billy Joel's""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> It is a love song about a woman whom the singer has fallen totally in love with to the extent of falling for her endearing quirks as well as her flaws. Joel wrote the song for his then-wife, Elizabeth Weber. Joe had taken over management of Joel's career, and was able to put his financial affairs in order after Joel had signed some bad deals and contracts. The two eventually divorced in 1982. Composition Joel has said that he was influenced by Gordon Lightfoot and his mellow acoustic guitar ballads. He stated in an interview that he was attempting to replicate the fingerpicking common in folk guitar music. He accomplishes this by playing arpeggiated triads in the right hand. He also notes that the production was purposely minimal to capture the purity of the tune as a folk song. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Billboard described 'She's Always a Woman' as a 'dramatic ballad.' Billboard particularly praised the 'subtle orchestration' and 'sophisticated melody,' which it found comparable to ballads by Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Cash Box said that 'the tune is melodic and flows sweetly; the lyric is precise and has something to say' and praised Joel's singing. Record World said that 'it is much like a [natural] progression of the message in 'Just the Way You Are' and should pick up immediate pop and adult airplay.' Jack Taliercio footage A Muzak version of 'She's Always a Woman' can be heard playing in the background of a video recorded in the Austin J. Tobin Plaza of the World Trade Center complex in New York City on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, after two commercial airliners hijacked by Al-Qaeda terrorists were deliberately flown into each of the Twin Towers as part of a large-scale terrorist attack. A news camera crew was in the plaza at the foot of the World Trade Center's South Tower. The camera operator, Jack Taliercio, zoomed in on the southern end of the tower's east face and recorded a man being forced out of a 79th floor window by heat, smoke and fire on the 79th and 80th floors. Trapped by the damage caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175, he tried to climb down in the hope of re-entering through an opening below the impact zone, but slipped and fell at 09:38:18. The soundtrack dissonance of the song playing as a man plummeted to his death from a burning skyscraper was viewed as 'surreal'.

Subsequently, the Billy Joel original re-entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 29 on May 1, 2010. On May 1, 2010, a new version of the advert aired; which shows more of the song cover. In the annual ITV poll for 2010 advert of the year; 'John Lewis – She's always a Woman' ranked fourth. The advert has been viewed on YouTube over 570,000 times (collectively from the top 3 results) since it aired on TV. Chart performance </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Share on FacebookShare on Twitter'She's Always a Woman' is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful songs in Billy Joel's repertoire. The Gordon Lightfoot inspired love ballad appears on Billy Joel's fifth studio album 'The Stranger' and was released as a single in 1978. But what's the story and meaning behind the song? Let's find out!The Meaning of She's Always a Woman'She's Always a Woman' is about Billy Joel's first wife Elizabeth Weber. Besides being Joel's wife, she was also his manager. A woman as a manager was a unique occurrence in the music industry of the 1970s. And as a result, a lot of men in the music industry considered Elizabeth to be 'Unfeminine' and 'Tough'. Billy Joel wrote the song to defend his wife. He implies that Elizabeth may be 'tough' and 'unfeminine' to people in the industry, but she's always a woman to him. The song is often misunderstood as misogynistic, beyond Joel's understanding. In Fred Schruers' book Billy Joel, he said: 'My take was 'She can ruin your faith with her casual lies/and she only reveals what she wants you to see' — all second person — but then it comes back to me: 'She's always a woman to me.' He later said in an interview: 'To me, it's a very simple understandable lyric. She may be that to you, but she's this to me.'Nowadays, 'She's Always a Woman' is often interpreted as an honest love song. As a song that declares love to a woman, despite her imperfections.Billy Joel By Rob Mieremet / Anefo – CC0,Billy Joel and Elizabeth WeberAs said earlier, the song was written for Joel's first wife Elizabeth Weber. Weber was initially married to a band member of Billy Joel, drummer Jon Small. Captivated by her intelligence and straightforwardness, Billy Joel started an affair with her. When Small found out about their affair, he decided to end his partnership with Joel. Weber initially decided to leave Billy Joel too, which made him suicidal. She later returned to him.Read more: The 10 Best Billy Joel Songs of All Time Billy Joel and Elizabeth Weber married in September 1973. She was the inspiration behind Billy Joel's 'Just The Way You Are' and 'She's Always a Woman'. These love ballads couldn't save Joel's marriage and they eventually went through a rough divorce in 1982.At the end of the 70s, 'Just The Way You Are' and 'She's Always a Woman' were staples in Billy Joel's live shows. But after his divorce from Elizabeth Weber, he scrapped the songs from the setlist. Joel stated that he lost the passion to play the songs. In recent years he brought 'She's Always a Woman' back on the setlist, often stating 'And then we got divorced' at the end of the song.The Song's Legacy'She's Always a Woman' appears on Billy Joel's fifth studio album 'The Stranger' and was released as a single in 1978. The song peaked at number 17 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also reached the charts in Canada, Belgium, and The Netherlands. In 1986, 'She's Always a Woman' entered the UK charts when the song was released as a double A-side with 'Just the Way You Are'. In 2010 the song reached the UK charts again due to a cover by Fyfe Dangerfield. Joel's original eventually reached number 29 on the UK singles chart.Tags: billy joelmeaningshe's always a womanstory </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The song made a remarkable comeback in 2010, charting again at #29 in the UK charts when Fyfe Dangerfield's abridged cover version of it was used in a commercial for the UK retailer John Lewis.

Let's find out!The Meaning of She's Always a Woman'She's Always a Woman' is about Billy Joel's first wife Elizabeth Weber. Besides being Joel's wife, she was also his manager. A woman as a manager was a unique occurrence in the music industry of the 1970s. And as a result, a lot of men in the music industry considered Elizabeth to be 'Unfeminine' and 'Tough'. Billy Joel wrote the song to defend his wife. He implies that Elizabeth may be 'tough' and 'unfeminine' to people in the industry, but she's always a woman to him. The song is often misunderstood as misogynistic, beyond Joel's understanding. In Fred Schruers' book Billy Joel, he said: 'My take was 'She can ruin your faith with her casual lies/and she only reveals what she wants you to see' — all second person — but then it comes back to me: 'She's always a woman to me.' He later said in an interview: 'To me, it's a very simple understandable lyric. She may be that to you, but she's this to me.'Nowadays, 'She's Always a Woman' is often interpreted as an honest love song. As a song that declares love to a woman, despite her imperfections.Billy Joel By Rob Mieremet / Anefo – CC0,Billy Joel and Elizabeth WeberAs said earlier, the song was written for Joel's first wife Elizabeth Weber.

Clarinet First on the list is a musical instrument many people are already familiar with: the clarinet. It is one of the most popular members of the woodwind family and is often featured in jazz and classical music. 2. Cello The cello is a European bowed string instrument that has been around since the 17th century. It is also known as a violoncello and is a member of the violin family. Being one of the most expressive instruments in existence, playing the cello is very rewarding for many musicians. 3. Cymbals Typically made from copper alloy, cymbals are percussion instruments often seen on a drum kit and are used to create rhythmic sounds. Although there are different types of cymbals including splash, ride, and crash, they all make a similar sound when striked. 4. Castanets </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Invented in 1886 by Auguste Mustel, the celesta sounds like a glockenspiel and looks like a small piano. But it has fewer octaves than a piano (three compared to four or five) and it is a transporting instrument, meaning it sounds one octave higher than the written pitch. 8. Clavichord The clavichord is another piano-like instrument that was very popular in late medieval times and during the classical era. It has a delicate and soft sound with a limited range of two and a half octaves, which is why it was mainly used as a practice instrument. 9. Chromatic Harmonica As the name suggests, the chromatic harmonica is a member of the harmonica family: a popular musical instrument that needs little introduction. What makes this one unique is that it allows you to play a wider range of notes than a regular diatonic harmonica. 10. Carillon When you hear the carillon, you will instantly think of church bells because that's exactly what a carillon is. It is a set of at least 23 tuned bells organized into a scale and housed in a bell tower. To play the bells, you press batons on a wooden piano-like keyword. 11. Calliope First used on riverboats and in circuses in the 18th century, the calliope is an ancient musical instrument that originally used steam to produce a sound similar to that of an organ. Over time, as the instrument evolved, it was powered by gas, and now air. 12. Charango From the lute family, the charango is an Andean string instrument developed during post-colonial times. It is made with armadillo shell and wood and typically it has five sets of two strings. It is tuned like a Spanish guitar and used for a variety of music styles. 13. Componium </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Crotales are a mini version of the cymbals we discussed earlier. They are little metal discs that produce a beautiful and long ringing sound when you strike them with hard brass or plastic mallets. Typically a set has one or two octaves and they are great for playing melodies. 17. Claves The claves are another simple percussion instrument consisting of two short wooden sticks. You hold one of the sticks in your hand and gently tap it with the other stick to produce a nice wooden resonant sound. 18. Clavicytherium The clavicytherium is a rare stringed piano-like instrument. You press keys on a wooden keyword and strings are plucked to create sound. Dating back to the 1400s, the clavicytherium is a museum piece kept in the Royal College of Music in London. 19. Clavicymbalum A clavicymbalum is a musical instrument belonging to the harpsichord family. Like its modern family the piano and the organ, it has a single keyboard with strings, but when you press a key on the keyboard, the strings are plucked, not struck by hammers. 20. Contrabass Balalaika The contrabass balalaika is a string instrument from Russia. It has three strings, two of which are tuned to the same key. The third string is tuned four notes higher. It is shaped like a triangle and it has a small fretted neck. 21. Cigar Box Guitar As the name suggests, the cigar box guitar is a wooden cigar box with strings attached to it. In the 1800s this instrument was a popular DIY alternative for African Americans who couldn't afford musical instruments like banjos and fiddles. 22. Cornet </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The strings are the largest family of instruments in the orchestra and they come in four sizes: the violin, which is the smallest, viola, cello, and the biggest, the double bass, sometimes called the contrabass. (Bass is pronounced 'base,' as in 'baseball.') The smaller instruments, the violin and viola, make higher-pitched sounds, while the larger cello and double bass produce low rich sounds. They are all similarly shaped, with curvy wooden bodies and wooden necks. The strings stretch over the body and neck and attach to small decorative heads, where they are tuned with small tuning pegs. Learn about each instrument in the string family:Violin • Viola • Cello • Double Bass • Harp Other instrument families:Woodwinds • Brass • Percussion Violin </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The viola is the older sister or brother of the violin. It is slightly larger, just over two feet long, and has thicker strings, which produce a richer, warmer sound than the violin. There are usually 10 to 14 violas in an orchestra and they almost always play the harmony. You play the viola the same way as you do the violin, by resting it between your chin and shoulder. Your left hand holds the neck of the viola and presses down on the strings to change the pitch, while your right hand moves the bow or plucks the strings. Cello The cello looks like the violin and viola but is much larger (around 4 feet long), and has thicker strings than either the violin or viola. Of all the string instruments, the cello sounds most like a human voice, and it can make a wide variety of tones, from warm low pitches to bright higher notes. There are usually 8 to 12 cellos in an orchestra and they play both harmony and melody. Since the cello is too large to put under your chin, you play it sitting down with the body of the cello between your knees, and the neck on your left shoulder. The body of the cello rests on the ground and is supported by a metal peg.

There was Emma by Hot Chocolate which had moved up to number three, Paper Lace's Billy Don't Be A Hero had just come down from number one and Terry Jacks rose to the top with Seasons In The Sun – any ideas?  Well, they were all on the subject of death. This week I look at the song that had just dropped from number one. Billy Don't Be A Hero was written by the songwriters Peter Callander and Mitch Murray who had met in the mid-sixties. Mitch had previously had success as the writer of How Do you Do It and I Like It for Gerry & The Pacemakers as well as the top three hits I'm Tellin' you Now and You Were Made For Me by Freddie & The Dreams whereas Peter had co-written, with other songwriter, hits for Tom Jones, Cilla Black and Paul and Barry Ryan, but the first hit they wrote together was The Tremeloes' 1967 number four hit Even The Bad Times Are Good. In January 1968 their song The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde, as sung by Georgie Fame, rose to the top slot giving them their first chart-topper and their first real story song. Just over three years later, another quality story song went to number two courtesy of Tony Christie's I Did What I Did for Maria. Story songs seemed to be the way forward and in 1974, after seeing a film about the War between the States, came up with the idea of writing a song about a the American Civil War and a guy who wants to go off to war despite his fiancé begging him to stay. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The war depicted in 'Billy, Don't Be A Hero' isn't the Vietnam War. It's apparently supposed to be the American Civil War, though the song itself never quite makes that clear. That lack of specificity isn't an accident. 'Billy, Don't Be A Hero' is supposed to be an eternal story of military sacrifice, the kind of thing that can apply all across history. It's not, of course. It's an incoherent delusion, and it's also a ferociously obnoxious piece of songcraft. 'Billy, Don't Be A Hero' came from Mitch Murray and Peter Callender, two long-tenured British songwriters. (Ten years before 'Billy, Don't Be A Hero,' Murray co-wrote another #1, Freddie And The Dreamers' 'I'm Telling You Now.') They gave the song to Paper Lace, a Nottingham band who'd just won the TV competition Opportunity Knocks. Paper Lace wore Civil War uniforms to lip-sync the song on Top Of The Pops, and it went to #1 in the UK. </p>",2025-11-19 19:25:32-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Even though we had started to withdraw troops in '71, it felt like the war was never going to end.

The song was written and composed by two British songwriters, Mitch Murray and Peter Callander. Because the song was released in 1974, it was associated by some listeners with the Vietnam War, though the war to which it actually refers is never identified in the lyrics. It has been suggested that the drum pattern, references to a marching band leading soldiers in blue, and 'riding out' (cavalry) refer to the American Civil War. For one of the band's performances on Top of the Pops they wore Union-style uniforms, as can be seen on YouTube and on 45 single record cover.

Explain to a third-grader: where is the cartilaginous joint found in the body,ETA3G,"""Cartilaginous joints are those in which the bones are connected by cartilage""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Cartilaginous joints are those in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints: synchondroses and symphyses. In a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. In symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone, but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae and between the pubic bones. Amphiarthroses allow only slight movement; therefore, either type of cartilaginous joint is an amphiarthrosis. Synovial Joints Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones. This space, referred to as the synovial (or joint) cavity, is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage. The entire joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue. This allows movement of the joint as well as resistance to dislocation. Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint. Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints. Since they allow for free movement, synovial joints are classified as diarthroses. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Slightly movable joint Cartilaginous jointCartilaginous jointsDetailsIdentifiersLatinjunctura cartilagineaTA98A03.0.00.015TA21528FMA7496Anatomical terminology[edit on Wikidata] Cartilaginous joints are connected entirely by cartilage (fibrocartilage or hyaline). Cartilaginous joints allow more movement between bones than a fibrous joint but less than the highly mobile synovial joint. Cartilaginous joints also forms the growth regions of immature long bones and the intervertebral discs of the spinal column. Primary cartilaginous joints Primary cartilaginous joints are known as 'synchondrosis'. These bones are connected by hyaline cartilage and sometimes occur between ossification centers. This cartilage may ossify with age. Some examples of primary cartilaginous joints in humans are the 'growth plates' between ossification centers in long bones. These joints allow very little movement, such as in the spine or ribs. Secondary cartilaginous joints Secondary cartilaginous joints are known as 'symphysis'. These include fibrocartilaginous and hyaline joints, which usually occur at the midline. Some examples of secondary cartilaginous joints in human anatomy would be the manubriosternal joint (between the manubrium and the body of the sternum), intervertebral discs, and the pubic symphysis. Articulating bones at a symphysis are covered with hyaline cartilage and have a thick, fairly compressible pad of fibrocartilage between them. Cartilaginous joints allow little movement, as summarized above. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap.

These joints allow very little movement, such as in the spine or ribs. Secondary cartilaginous joints Secondary cartilaginous joints are known as 'symphysis'. These include fibrocartilaginous and hyaline joints, which usually occur at the midline. Some examples of secondary cartilaginous joints in human anatomy would be the manubriosternal joint (between the manubrium and the body of the sternum), intervertebral discs, and the pubic symphysis. Articulating bones at a symphysis are covered with hyaline cartilage and have a thick, fairly compressible pad of fibrocartilage between them. Cartilaginous joints allow little movement, as summarized above. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the manubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Figure 9.4.3 – Types of Synovial Joints: The six types of synovial joints allow the body to move in a variety of ways. (a) Pivot joints allow for rotation around an axis, such as between the first and second cervical vertebrae, which allows for side-to-side rotation of the head. (b) The hinge joint of the elbow works like a door hinge. (c) The articulation between the trapezium carpal bone and the first metacarpal bone at the base of the thumb is a saddle joint. (d) Plane joints, such as those between the tarsal bones of the foot, allow for limited gliding movements between bones. (e) The radiocarpal joint of the wrist is a condyloid joint. (f) The hip and shoulder joints are the only ball-and-socket joints of the body. Pivot Joint </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Ball-and-Socket Joint The joint with the greatest range of motion is the ball-and-socket joint. At these joints, the rounded head of one bone (the ball) fits into the concave articulation (the socket) of the adjacent bone (see Figure 9.4.3f). The hip joint and the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint are the only ball-and-socket joints of the body. At the hip joint, the head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone, and at the shoulder joint, the head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints: synchondroses and symphyses. In a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. In symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae. Either type of cartilaginous joint allows for very little movement. Synovial Joints </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> A cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage is called a symphysis ('growing together'). Fibrocartilage is very strong because it contains numerous bundles of thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much greater ability to resist pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage. This gives symphyses the ability to strongly unite the adjacent bones, but can still allow for limited movement to occur. Thus, a symphysis is functionally classified as an amphiarthrosis. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the manubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> There are two types of cartilaginous joints. A synchondrosis is formed when the adjacent bones are united by hyaline cartilage. A temporary synchondrosis is formed by the epiphyseal plate of a growing long bone, which is lost when the epiphyseal plate ossifies as the bone reaches maturity. The synchondrosis is thus replaced by a synostosis. Permanent synchondroses that do not ossify are found at the first sternocostal joint and between the anterior ends of the bony ribs and the junction with their costal cartilage. A symphysis is where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage and the gap between the bones may be narrow or wide. A narrow symphysis is found at the manubriosternal joint and at the pubic symphysis. A wide symphysis is the intervertebral symphysis in which the bodies of adjacent vertebrae are united by an intervertebral disc. Interactive Link Questions </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Cartilaginous joints are where the adjacent bones are joined by cartilage. At a synchondrosis, the bones are united by hyaline cartilage. The epiphyseal plate of growing long bones and the first sternocostal joint that unites the first rib to the sternum are examples of synchondroses. At a symphysis, the bones are joined by fibrocartilage, which is strong and flexible. Symphysis joints include the intervertebral symphysis between adjacent vertebrae and the pubic symphysis that joins the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones. Both functional and structural classifications can be used to describe an individual joint. Define the first sternocostal joint and the pubic symphysis using both functional and structural characteristics. </p>",2025-11-20 10:52:00-08:00,False,Response is valid.

It then turns in a generally southward direction, flowing through the Pantanal wetlands, the city of Corumbá, then running close to the Brazil-Bolivia border for a short distance in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. From the city of Puerto Bahia Negra, Paraguay, the river forms the border between Paraguay and Brazil, flowing almost due south before the confluence with the Apa River. The Paraguay-Bolivia-Brazil tripoint map. The Paraguay River is the second major river of the Rio de la Plata Basin, after the Paraná River. The Paraguay's drainage basin, about 1,095,000 square kilometres (423,000 sq mi), covers a vast area that includes major portions of Argentina, southern Brazil, parts of Bolivia, and most of the country of Paraguay. Unlike many of the other great rivers of the Rio de la Plata Basin, the Paraguay has not been dammed for hydroelectric power generation; for this reason it is navigable for a considerable distance, second only to the Amazon River in terms of navigable length on the continent. This makes it an important shipping and trade corridor, providing a much-needed link to the Atlantic Ocean for the otherwise landlocked nations of Paraguay and Bolivia. It serves such important cities as Asunción and Concepción in Paraguay and Formosa in Argentina. The river is also a source of commerce in the form of fishing, and provides irrigation for agriculture along its route. As such it provides a way of life for a number of poor fishermen who live along its banks and make the majority of their income selling fish in local markets, as well as supplying a major source of sustenance for their families. This has created issues in large cities such as Asunción, where poverty-stricken farmers from the country's interior have populated the river's banks in search of an easier lifestyle. Seasonal flooding of the river's banks sometimes forces many thousands of displaced residents to seek temporary shelter until the waters recede from their homes. The Paraguayan military has been forced to dedicate land on one of its reserves in the capital to emergency housing for these displaced citizens. The river is a tourist attraction for its beauty. History The original inhabitants of the upper Paraguay River were the Guarani peoples. The Paraguay River was explored in the 16th century by Sebastian Cabot, who at that time became the first recorded European to discover both the Paraná and Paraguay rivers. For hundreds of years, this river has served as the main route of Paraguay to the outside world. Since that time, the river has had its vitality and importance, but is used today for a convoy of barges. Wetland controversy This section does not cite any sources.

Directly after the inflow of Bermejo River, the pH of the Paraguay River may reach up to 8.2. The typical pH of the Paraguay River is 5.8—7.4 in the upper part (defined as the section before the inflow of the first non-Pantanal tributary, the Apa River) and 6.3—7.9 in the lower part. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Basin featuresRiver systemRío de la PlataTributaries  • leftIguaçu, Piquiri, Ivaí, Paranapanema, Tietê, Rio Grande • rightSalado, Paraguay, Ivinhema, Pardo, Paranaiba The Paraná River (Portuguese: Rio Paraná [ˈʁi.u paɾaˈna] ⓘ; (Spanish: Río Paraná [ˈri.o paɾaˈna] ⓘ; Guarani: Ysyry Parana) is a river in south-central South America, running through Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina for some 4,880 kilometres (3,030 mi). Among South American rivers, it is second in length only to the Amazon River. It merges with the Paraguay River and then farther downstream with the Uruguay River to form the Río de la Plata and empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The first European to go up the Paraná River was the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot, in 1526, while working for Spain. A drought hit the river in 2021, causing a 77-year low. Etymology In eastern South America there is 'an immense number of river names containing the element para- or parana-', from Guarani language words meaning 'river' or 'sea'; attempts to derive a more precise meaning for the name of this, the largest of them, e.g. 'kin of the sea', have been discounted. Course The course is formed at the confluence of the Paranaiba and Rio Grande rivers in southern Brazil. From the confluence the river flows in a generally southwestern direction for about 619 km (385 mi) before encountering the city of Saltos del Guaira, Paraguay. This was once the location of the Guaíra Falls (Sete Quedas waterfalls, where the Paraná fell over a series of seven cascades. This natural feature was said to rival the world-famous Iguazu Falls to the south. The falls were flooded, however, by the construction of the Itaipu Dam, which began operating in 1984. After merging with the Iguazu, the Paraná becomes the natural border between Paraguay and Argentina. Overlooking the Paraná River from Encarnación, Paraguay, across the river, is downtown Posadas, Argentina. The river continues its general southward course for about 468 km (291 mi) before making a gradual turn to the west for another 820 km (510 mi), and then encounters the Paraguay River, the largest tributary along the course of the river. Before this confluence, the river passes through a second major hydroelectric project, the Yacyretá Dam, a joint project between Paraguay and Argentina. The massive reservoir formed by the project has been the source of a number of problems for people living along the river, most notably the poorer merchants and residents in the low-lying areas of Encarnación, a major city on the southern border of Paraguay. River levels rose dramatically upon completion of the dam, flooding out large sections of the city's lower areas. Together with its tributaries, the Rio Paraná forms a massive drainage basin that encompasses much of the southcentral part of South America, essentially including all of Paraguay, much of southern Brazil, northern Argentina, and the southeastern part of Bolivia. If the Uruguay River is counted as a tributary to the Paraná, this watershed extends to cover most of Uruguay as well. The volume of water flowing into the Atlantic Ocean through the Río de la Plata roughly equals the volume at the Mississippi River delta.

It follows a generally southwesterly course, passing through the Brazilian city of Cáceres. It then turns in a generally southward direction, flowing through the Pantanal wetlands, the city of Corumbá, then running close to the Brazil-Bolivia border for a short distance in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. From the city of Puerto Bahia Negra, Paraguay, the river forms the border between Paraguay and Brazil, flowing almost due south before the confluence with the Apa River. The Paraguay-Bolivia-Brazil tripoint map. The Paraguay River is the second major river of the Rio de la Plata Basin, after the Paraná River. The Paraguay's drainage basin, about 1,095,000 square kilometres (423,000 sq mi), covers a vast area that includes major portions of Argentina, southern Brazil, parts of Bolivia, and most of the country of Paraguay. Unlike many of the other great rivers of the Rio de la Plata Basin, the Paraguay has not been dammed for hydroelectric power generation; for this reason it is navigable for a considerable distance, second only to the Amazon River in terms of navigable length on the continent. This makes it an important shipping and trade corridor, providing a much-needed link to the Atlantic Ocean for the otherwise landlocked nations of Paraguay and Bolivia. It serves such important cities as Asunción and Concepción in Paraguay and Formosa in Argentina. The river is also a source of commerce in the form of fishing, and provides irrigation for agriculture along its route. As such it provides a way of life for a number of poor fishermen who live along its banks and make the majority of their income selling fish in local markets, as well as supplying a major source of sustenance for their families. This has created issues in large cities such as Asunción, where poverty-stricken farmers from the country's interior have populated the river's banks in search of an easier lifestyle. Seasonal flooding of the river's banks sometimes forces many thousands of displaced residents to seek temporary shelter until the waters recede from their homes. The Paraguayan military has been forced to dedicate land on one of its reserves in the capital to emergency housing for these displaced citizens. The river is a tourist attraction for its beauty. History The original inhabitants of the upper Paraguay River were the Guarani peoples. The Paraguay River was explored in the 16th century by Sebastian Cabot, who at that time became the first recorded European to discover both the Paraná and Paraguay rivers. For hundreds of years, this river has served as the main route of Paraguay to the outside world. Since that time, the river has had its vitality and importance, but is used today for a convoy of barges. Wetland controversy This section does not cite any sources.

The Pantanal is the world's largest tropical wetland and is largely dependent upon waters provided by the Paraguay River. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The Paraguay River basin includes several distinctive habitats, ranging from very clear waters such as Rio da Prata (pt) near Bonito in the upper part to the sediment-rich Bermejo River in the lower part. The suspended load of the Paraguay River is about 100 milligrams per litre (3.6×10−6 lb/cu in) before the inflow of Bermejo, but rises to about 600 milligrams per litre (2.2×10−5 lb/cu in) after. Directly after the inflow of Bermejo River, the pH of the Paraguay River may reach up to 8.2. The typical pH of the Paraguay River is 5.8—7.4 in the upper part (defined as the section before the inflow of the first non-Pantanal tributary, the Apa River) and 6.3—7.9 in the lower part. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Basin featuresRiver systemRío de la PlataTributaries  • leftIguaçu, Piquiri, Ivaí, Paranapanema, Tietê, Rio Grande • rightSalado, Paraguay, Ivinhema, Pardo, Paranaiba The Paraná River (Portuguese: Rio Paraná [ˈʁi.u paɾaˈna] ⓘ; (Spanish: Río Paraná [ˈri.o paɾaˈna] ⓘ; Guarani: Ysyry Parana) is a river in south-central South America, running through Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina for some 4,880 kilometres (3,030 mi). Among South American rivers, it is second in length only to the Amazon River. It merges with the Paraguay River and then farther downstream with the Uruguay River to form the Río de la Plata and empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The first European to go up the Paraná River was the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot, in 1526, while working for Spain. A drought hit the river in 2021, causing a 77-year low. Etymology In eastern South America there is 'an immense number of river names containing the element para- or parana-', from Guarani language words meaning 'river' or 'sea'; attempts to derive a more precise meaning for the name of this, the largest of them, e.g. 'kin of the sea', have been discounted. Course The course is formed at the confluence of the Paranaiba and Rio Grande rivers in southern Brazil. From the confluence the river flows in a generally southwestern direction for about 619 km (385 mi) before encountering the city of Saltos del Guaira, Paraguay. This was once the location of the Guaíra Falls (Sete Quedas waterfalls, where the Paraná fell over a series of seven cascades. This natural feature was said to rival the world-famous Iguazu Falls to the south. The falls were flooded, however, by the construction of the Itaipu Dam, which began operating in 1984. After merging with the Iguazu, the Paraná becomes the natural border between Paraguay and Argentina. Overlooking the Paraná River from Encarnación, Paraguay, across the river, is downtown Posadas, Argentina. The river continues its general southward course for about 468 km (291 mi) before making a gradual turn to the west for another 820 km (510 mi), and then encounters the Paraguay River, the largest tributary along the course of the river. Before this confluence, the river passes through a second major hydroelectric project, the Yacyretá Dam, a joint project between Paraguay and Argentina. The massive reservoir formed by the project has been the source of a number of problems for people living along the river, most notably the poorer merchants and residents in the low-lying areas of Encarnación, a major city on the southern border of Paraguay. River levels rose dramatically upon completion of the dam, flooding out large sections of the city's lower areas. Together with its tributaries, the Rio Paraná forms a massive drainage basin that encompasses much of the southcentral part of South America, essentially including all of Paraguay, much of southern Brazil, northern Argentina, and the southeastern part of Bolivia. If the Uruguay River is counted as a tributary to the Paraná, this watershed extends to cover most of Uruguay as well. The volume of water flowing into the Atlantic Ocean through the Río de la Plata roughly equals the volume at the Mississippi River delta. This watershed contains a number of large cities, including São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Rosario, Asunción, Brasília, and La Plata. </p>",2025-11-20 03:19:53-08:00,False,Response is valid.
Explain to a third-grader: who proposed the first accurate model of dna,ETA3G,"""Many people believe that American biologist James Watson and English physicist Francis Crick discovered DNA in the 1950s""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Many people believe that American biologist James Watson and English physicist Francis Crick discovered DNA in the 1950s. In reality, this is not the case. Rather, DNA was first identified in the late 1860s by Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher. Then, in the decades following Miescher's discovery, other scientists--notably, Phoebus Levene and Erwin Chargaff--carried out a series of research efforts that revealed additional details about the DNA molecule, including its primary chemical components and the ways in which they joined with one another. Without the scientific foundation provided by these pioneers, Watson and Crick may never have reached their groundbreaking conclusion of 1953: that the DNA molecule exists in the form of a three-dimensional double helix. The First Piece of the Puzzle: Miescher Discovers DNA Although few people realize it, 1869 was a landmark year in genetic research, because it was the year in which Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher first identified what he called 'nuclein' inside the nuclei of human white blood cells. (The term 'nuclein' was later changed to 'nucleic acid' and eventually to 'deoxyribonucleic acid,' or 'DNA.') Miescher's plan was to isolate and characterize not the nuclein (which nobody at that time realized existed) but instead the protein components of leukocytes (white blood cells). Miescher thus made arrangements for a local surgical clinic to send him used, pus-coated patient bandages; once he received the bandages, he planned to wash them, filter out the leukocytes, and extract and identify the various proteins within the white blood cells. But when he came across a substance from the cell nuclei that had chemical properties unlike any protein, including a much higher phosphorous content and resistance to proteolysis (protein digestion), Miescher realized that he had discovered a new substance (Dahm, 2008). Sensing the importance of his findings, Miescher wrote, 'It seems probable to me that a whole family of such slightly varying phosphorous-containing substances will appear, as a group of nucleins, equivalent to proteins' (Wolf, 2003). More than 50 years passed before the significance of Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids was widely appreciated by the scientific community. For instance, in a 1971 essay on the history of nucleic acid research, Erwin Chargaff noted that in a 1961 historical account of nineteenth-century science, Charles Darwin was mentioned 31 times, Thomas Huxley 14 times, but Miescher not even once. This omission is all the more remarkable given that, as Chargaff also noted, Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids was unique among the discoveries of the four major cellular components (i.e., proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids) in that it could be 'dated precisely...

Making a name of himself in the music world, Kanye was now given the reigns to fully realize his artistic vision in the world of sneakers. Kanye went on to create the Yeezy range that became iconic around the world. adidas Yeezy Boost 750 Released in 2015, Yeezy Season 1 kicked off with the adidas Yeezy Boost 750, Kanye's first official adidas sneaker. These high-top sneakers featured a full suede upper, the infamous cross-strap, a full-length zipper and a tech upgrade with the iconic BOOST sole. The design of the sneaker was inspired by UGG boots with a look that was styled for Marty McFly from Back to the Future – giving you a comfy look with a futuristic edge. adidas Yeezy Boost 950 Duckboot </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Continuing to switch things up, the Yeezy 500 came as the first Yeezy not featuring a BOOST midsole. These sneakers came with the 'Feet You Wear' sole, which has a 20-year history. The sole originally debuted on Kobe Bryant's signature adidas KB8 III sneaks in '99 – primarily to help b-ballers avoid rolling their ankles on the court. The oversized look of the sole now fits in perfectly with the chunky sneaker trend. Teasing the sneaker throughout 2017, with Kanye appearing in public wearing the previously unseen silhouette, it wasn't until April of 2018 that the kicks saw a drop in the 'Desert Rat' colorway. Yeezy sneakers from adidas are a realization of Kanye West's goal to create iconic kicks. Ever since starting out his career as a struggling producer working where he could, Kanye has now established himself as a force in both the world of music and sneakers.

SHOP YEEZY Share WHAT TO READ NEXT </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Adidas Yeezy (or just Yeezy) was a fashion collaboration between American rapper, designer, and entrepreneur Kanye West's[a] Yeezy and German sportswear company Adidas. It offered sneakers in limited edition colorways, as well as shirts, jackets, track pants, socks, slides, lingerie and slippers. The first shoe model ('Boost 750') was released in February 2015. In 2020 Forbes described Yeezy's rise as 'one of the great retail stories of the century'. Yeezy influenced and inspired a multitude of other fashion brands. Outside of the former Adidas collaboration, Yeezy is the name of Kanye's company Yeezy LLC and is not connected to Adidas. In October 2022, Adidas announced that it terminated its collaboration with West with immediate effect after the rapper made antisemitic remarks through various media outlets. History Proposed 'Pastelle' line and 2006 meeting American rapper Kanye West had collaborated with Nike before his partnership with Adidas. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> In February 2015, the Adidas and West collaboration officially debuted. 'Yeezy Season 1' was highly anticipated and celebrities such as Rihanna, Diddy, and West's then-wife Kim Kardashian were at the introductory fashion show. The line featured heavy inspiration from military designs, which West had stated was driven by 2011 England riots. Bomber jackets, sweatpants, and stylized military jackets were heavily featured in the Yeezy Season 1 collection. While the fashion show started late, many deemed it as a success. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> 'Yeezy Season 1' was released on October 29, 2015, and was the first apparel collection to release from this collaboration. The presentation was designed in collaboration with performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, who has previously worked with West on music videos and set designs. This collection was noted for its stripped-down, ready-to-wear style, which drew on military clothing and flesh-toned colors. The prices ranged from $600 for sweatpants to $3,000 for jackets. Although the footwear sold out quickly, the apparel collection did not. West revealed in a 2018 interview that he was in talks with Louis Vuitton for a $30 million apparel deal. The deal was not approved by the LVMH board and West was left with no clothing partners. After the 'Yeezy Season 1' show, Adidas announced it would no longer be a part of Yeezy apparel, instead focusing on the footwear collection with West.[citation needed] </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The Yeezy Foam Runner is the first Adidas Yeezy shoe made in the United States and first released exclusively through Yeezy Supply on June 26, 2020.

This came right after the release of the Air Yeezy 2s. Instead of paying royalties for Kanye's designs, Nike decided to donate his earnings to a charity of his choice. Lucky for Kanye, this wasn't the last time that he was approached for a partnership. After leaving Nike, Kanye was approached by Adidas, who, unlike Nike, offered to pay royalties for his designs (a 15% wholesale royalty). For Kanye, this felt like more of a true partnership between two brands. 2015: Yeezy's initial releases and Yeezy's partnership with Adidas The first shoe that Kanye released was the Yeezy Boost 750. For this sneaker, Kanye got his inspiration from a futuristic shoe design he saw in Australia. A limited-edition 'Light Brown' version of the shoe followed this initial release, and the 9,000 pairs sold out within 10 minutes. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Yeezy sneakers were popular with everyone, athletes included. Kanye decided to create a line of sneakers specifically for football which debuted in an NFL kickoff game in 2016. While the athletes loved these, DeAndre Hopkins, a wide receiver on the Houston Texas, was fined $6,000 by the NFL for having these Yeezy 350 Cleats on. That's because when the cleats were designed, they did not have a strong enough base color, which is part of the NFL's kit policy. During this same year, Yeezy released even more color schemes (like Beluga, Zebra, Black and White, and Cream White) for its highly successful Yeezy Boost 350 line, during the third season of Yeezy. Beyond updating the colors, the Yeezy brand also updated the structural components of the shoe and eliminated the heel tab. 2017: The Yeezy Powerphase Calabasas & Yeezy Boost 700 </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> Unlike sneakers that were designed outside of United States, this Adidas Yeezy sneaker was designed in the States. The brand sold this directly on its website in June 2020 for a price of $75, cheaper than their past shoe designs.

The constitution was drafted by 299 delegates from different caste, region, religion, gender etc. These delegates sat over 114 days spread over 3 years (2 years 11 months and 18 days to be precise) and discussed what the constitution should contain and what laws should be included.

Upon independence in 1947, Prasad was elected as President of the Constituent Assembly of India, which prepared the Constitution of India and which served as its provisional Parliament. When India became a republic in 1950, Prasad was elected as its first president by the Constituent Assembly. As president, Prasad established a tradition for non-partisanship and independence for the office-bearer and retired from Congress party politics. Although a ceremonial head of state, Prasad encouraged the development of education in India and advised government on several occasions. In 1957, Prasad was re-elected to the presidency, becoming the only president to serve two full terms. Prasad stayed in office for the longest term of around 12 years.

Explain to a third-grader: how much were the actors in the office paid,ETA3G,"""According to Cheat Sheet, Fischer was also included in the $20,000 per episode pay scale for the series' first three seasons""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Office is an American mockumentary sitcom television series based on the 2001–2003 BBC series of the same name created by (and starring) Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Adapted for NBC by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons, the show depicts the everyday work lives of office employees at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, and aired from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, with a total of nine seasons consisting of 201 episodes. The show was co-produced by Daniels' Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions (later Shine America), in association with Universal Television. The original executive producers were Daniels, Gervais, Merchant, Howard Klein and Ben Silverman, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The Office received moderately positive reviews from critics (except for the pilot episode which received mixed reviews) during its short first season, but the following seasons, particularly Carell's performance, received significant acclaim from television critics as the show's characters, content, structure, and tone diverged considerably from the original British series. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards including a Peabody Award in 2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for Outstanding Comedy Series, in 2006. The eighth season was criticized for a decline in quality, with Carell's departure in season seven seen as a contributing factor. However, the ninth and final season ended the series with a generally positive response. The series finale, which originally aired on May 16, 2013, was viewed by an estimated 5.7 million viewers and garnered critical acclaim. In 2016, Rolling Stone named The Office one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time. Greg Daniels developed the British Office series for American television and served as the showrunner for the first four seasons of the series. He then left the position when he co-created the comedy series Parks and Recreation with fellow Office writer Michael Schur and divided his time between both series. Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta were named the showrunners for the fifth season. Celotta left the series after the sixth season and Lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons. He left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential Dwight Schrute spin-off, The Farm, which was eventually passed on by NBC. Daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season. Other executive producers include cast members B. J. Novak and Mindy Kaling. Kaling, Novak, Daniels, Lieberstein and Schur made up the original team of writers. Kaling, Novak, and Lieberstein also served multiple roles on the series, as they played regular characters on the show, as well as wrote, directed, and produced episodes. Credited with twenty-four episodes, Kaling is the most prolific writer among the staff. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British series, are credited as executive producers and wrote both pilot and the third-season episode 'The Convict'. Merchant later directed the episode 'Customer Survey', while Gervais appeared in the episodes 'The Seminar' and 'Search Committee', reprising his role as David Brent from the British series. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> When it came to choosing the theme music for The Office, producer Greg Daniels had several tracks he was thinking of using: existing songs including 'Better Things' by The Kinks, 'Float On' by Modest Mouse, and 'Mr. Blue Sky' by Electric Light Orchestra, and several original pieces artists contributed to the producers via a cattle call. Daniels decided that the cast would vote on what song to use and gave them four of the choices. Most of them wanted 'Mr. Blue Sky', but that option turned out to be invalid as it was already used in the drama series LAX (2004–2005). Thus, the final choice was an original track written by Jay Ferguson and performed by The Scrantones. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> For many viewers, The Office is also what made Steve Carell a star. Before he starred in comedies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Anchorman, Carell was Michael Scott on The Office. The show, which is also known as one of the first series to popularize the mockumentary-style comedy, has also been nominated for dozens of Emmys and won Outstanding Comedy Series in 2006. While it's critical and commercial success was a plug, we're also sure that The Office cast salary wasn't bad either. Find out how much six of the main cast members made when the show was on air ahead. Steve Carell Image: Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $80 million Salary: $175,000 per episode It's no secret that Carell was the breakout star from The Office. After the show's first season in 2003, Carell booked roles in blockbuster films like Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Evan Almighty. While he's a household name now, Carell, who played Dunder Mifflin Regional Manager Michael Scott, didn't have the same star-level salary in season 1 of The Office. It's reported that the actor made $87,000 per episode for seasons 1 and 2 before a raise to $175,000 per episode for season 3. It's unclear what Carell made for the other six seasons, but even if he did still have that $175,000 per episode rate, he would've raked in around $3.5 million each season, which is more than a lot of other hit shows out there. Celebrity Net Worth reports that he's worth $80 million. John Krasinski Image: Chris Haston/Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $30 million Salary: $100,000 per episode </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Fischer played Dunder Mifflin receptionist Pam Beesly. According to Cheat Sheet, Fischer was also included in the $20,000 per episode pay scale for the series' first three seasons. By season 4, her salary was raised to $100,000 per episode, which would've paid her close to $2.8 million per season by The Office's end. While on The Office, Fischer starred in films like Blades of Glory and Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. According to Celebrity Net Worth, she's worth $16 million. Rainn Wilson Image: Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $14 million Salary: $100,000 per episode </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Angela Kinsey, known for her role as Angela Martin, has a net worth of $8 million and has continued to work on other projects. The lovable secretary Pam Beesly, played by Jenna Fischer, has a net worth of $12 million and has appeared in other comedies alongside The Office. The ninth and final season of The Office ended in 2013, but fans would continue to stream the show on Netflix for years, making the comedy one of the most-watched shows on the streaming platform. It would later move to Peacock, the streaming service for NBCUniversal - and once again, fans just kept binging the sensation. It's safe to say, The Office is a beloved piece of programming, and that is certainly reflected in its stars' bank accounts. Over the years, most of the main cast members from The Office have continued to work and grow their net worths since the show. Steve Carell, for one, is now an Oscar-nominated movie star, and went on to act in hits like The Morning Show and Space Force. John Krasinski, meanwhile, has become a renowned director (hello, A Quiet Place) and action hero in Jack Ryan. As for fellow show alums Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, they've continued to capitalize on the show, shifting their focus to podcasting, through their Office-themed podcast, Office Ladies. Related Fans Were Not Surprised By 'Secrets' In An Unaired The Office Episode An unaired episode with an interesting plot for Kevin Malone surprised no one when Brian Baumgartner revealed the details. There is no doubt that The Office has made the cast members millionaires, but just how much money is each actor from the show really worth, today? Whose net worth is the highest? Take a look below and see which cast members of the widely popular show earn the most money. Updated November 2023: 'The Office' remains one of the most popular shows of all time. However, with the hit series leaving Netflix, fans of the series had to either watch the show syndicated on cable or subscribe to Peacock. But regardless of where 'The Office' can be seen, it is clear by the resumes of its stars that it launched the careers of just about all the actors. And with all the stars currently involved in television and filmmaking, it appears that their careers will continue to boost their net worths well into the future. 10 Angela Kinsey Net Worth: $8 Million via Instar Character on The Office: Angela Martin </p>",2025-11-19 19:58:12-08:00,False,Response is valid.

The show was originally created in the United Kingdom by Granada Television and produced by its subsidiary, ITV's then London franchise London Weekend Television (LWT) and developed by a team including James Allen, Natalka Znak, Brent Baker and Stewart Morris. The first episode aired on 25 August 2002 hosted by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, also known as Ant and Dec. It is now produced by ITV Studios and has been licensed globally to countries including the United States, Germany, France, Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, Russia, Australia and India.

(often shortened to I'm a Celebrity or I'm a Celeb) is a British survival reality television show, that is broadcast on ITV. It was created by London Weekend Television (LWT) and is produced by Lifted Entertainment. The format sees a group of celebrities living together in extreme conditions with few creature comforts. Each member undertakes challenges to secure additional food and treats for the group, and to avoid being voted out by viewers during their stay, with the final episode's votes nominating who wins a series. The programme's first series debuted on 25 August 2002 and was filmed within Tully, Queensland, Australia. Series from 2003 to 2019 were filmed around Murwillumbah, New South Wales, Australia. The 2020 and 2021 series were filmed at Gwrych Castle in Wales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before returning to Australia in 2022. Celebrities participating on the programme nominate a charity to receive a donation from ITV, with the money raised from charges on voting via text, phone or interactive services. Each series has been hosted by Ant & Dec, with the sole exception being the eighteenth series in 2018 when Ant McPartlin suspended his TV appearances for a year, so Declan Donnelly was joined instead by Holly Willoughby. I'm a Celebrity is often a ratings winner for ITV, attracting on average over 9 million viewers each series, with its success spawning an international franchise of the same name. The main show was accompanied by a sister show from 2002 until 2019 on ITV2, entitled I'm a Celebrity: Extra Camp, which featured behind-the-scenes footage and discussions on celebrities voted out of the latest episode, and clips of the next episode. In 2022, the show won The Sir Bruce Forsyth Entertainment Award at the National Television Awards. The show will remain on air until at least 2025. In 2023, an all-stars series, I'm a Celebrity... South Africa, was aired. Format Ant & Dec have hosted the show together since it began in 2002, with the exception of the 2018 series. Dec was joined by Holly Willoughby for the 2018 series </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> As part of the agreement with Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, ITV will help support the ongoing restoration project of the site. This has included the adding of permanent roofs to certain sections of the castle and repairs to the walls, floors and stairs to make the building safe and secure. ITV has reportedly donated £300,000 to the trust for the use of the site for four months, as well as paying for additional emergency restoration work. Production began on the site in September 2020. On 2 August 2021, it was confirmed that the show would return to Wales for a second series, due to 'continued uncertainty' over the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions.' In October 2021, it was reported that ITV Studios' U.S. subsidiary and horror film studio Blumhouse was pitching a reboot of the American version of I'm a Celebrity under the title Celebrity Castle, which was reported to have expanded upon the series 20 concept.

Each day feels like it's zooming along and I look back and wonder where all the time went. So much has changed that I can barely keep up with everything. Perhaps that's why I like to take little trips back to my past. I remember that slowness and can reconnect with it just a bit. As my mind traveled back this evening, I remembered my mother saying, 'how now, brown cow?' as a form of greeting. I had no idea at the time where she'd picked up such a phrase, but it was apparently one used in teaching diction. It's similar to the 'rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain' from My Fair Lady, though far shorter and more ridiculous. And it later became a fun way to greet people. The cow phrase, thankfully not the rain in Spain bit. I thought it was fun, even though she was technically referring to me as a cow. But, since I thought cows were rather cute, that felt like a compliment. Greetings like these date back to the time of William Shakespeare, which would have been something more like 'how say you now?' These more descriptive phrases, of course, have in modern times been artlessly reduced to 's'up?' It never occurred to me at the time, but that greeting my mother had used was rather revolutionary. By using it, she wasn't simply asking what I had been doing, she was asking what I would immediately be doing next. So, my response was always a description of what I was thinking about doing and sometimes even a silly thing that just came to mind. I've no idea if she was doing it on purpose, but she taught me to always imagine more than just the moment I had just lived. Though that moment might have seemed perfectly mundane, what fun thing did I have planned to immediately take place next? I grew up always knowing that there was something more interesting waiting for me around the corner, and that's fueled me through my entire life. Sure, some days are not particularly interesting, but there's always a next one. And unlike the calf who zooms into adulthood, we have a bit more time to riddle it all out. Our own mothers and fathers have whispered amazing things into our ears and given us gifts of knowledge that we didn't even realize we'd received at the time. A simple phrase, a casual instruction, and a gentle push in a particular direction. And, I adore the gift my mother gave me in that silly phrase, subtlety asking me to focus on the near future with just a simple, 'how now, brown cow?' </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Vowel diagram for English diphthongs including /aʊ/, charting tongue height and position during articulation 'How now brown cow' is a phrase used in elocution teaching to demonstrate the diphthong /aʊ/.

Its Origins and UsageJanuary 6th, 2015When I was very little (less than 5 years old), all the kids in my neighborhood used to chant, 'How now brown cow!' It turns out that the phrase originally came from Scotland in the 1700's.  Some sources say that, 'brown cow' was a phrase that used to mean a barrel of beer because a barrel of beer is brown and ungainly like a cow.  Other sources said 'brown cow' just referred to the beer and that people could order another beer by saying, 'How now brown cow.' More recently, 'brown cow' can refer to a root beer float (i.e. vanilla ice cream floating in root beer soda).  The phrase, 'How now brown cow' has been used as a pronunciation exercise (like 'The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain').  It has also been used as a playground chant in some parts.

Greetings like these date back to the time of William Shakespeare, which would have been something more like 'how say you now?' These more descriptive phrases, of course, have in modern times been artlessly reduced to 's'up?' It never occurred to me at the time, but that greeting my mother had used was rather revolutionary. By using it, she wasn't simply asking what I had been doing, she was asking what I would immediately be doing next. So, my response was always a description of what I was thinking about doing and sometimes even a silly thing that just came to mind. I've no idea if she was doing it on purpose, but she taught me to always imagine more than just the moment I had just lived. Though that moment might have seemed perfectly mundane, what fun thing did I have planned to immediately take place next? I grew up always knowing that there was something more interesting waiting for me around the corner, and that's fueled me through my entire life. Sure, some days are not particularly interesting, but there's always a next one. And unlike the calf who zooms into adulthood, we have a bit more time to riddle it all out. Our own mothers and fathers have whispered amazing things into our ears and given us gifts of knowledge that we didn't even realize we'd received at the time. A simple phrase, a casual instruction, and a gentle push in a particular direction. And, I adore the gift my mother gave me in that silly phrase, subtlety asking me to focus on the near future with just a simple, 'how now, brown cow?' </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Vowel diagram for English diphthongs including /aʊ/, charting tongue height and position during articulation 'How now brown cow' is a phrase used in elocution teaching to demonstrate the diphthong /aʊ/.

I am bringing up this subject because I don't hear well.  At least I don't hear well enough to distinguish words as many, even most, people deliver them.  I wish more speakers would take advantage of Toastmaster's International or other public speaking opportunities.  Communication is a two way street.   We hear a lot about being a good listener, but not much about being a good speaker. One way to practice speaking plainly is by use of tongue twisters.  So have your children and grand children join in old fashioned stand byes like: How now, Brown Cow. Rubber baby buggy bumpers. Susie's sister sewed socks for soldiers. A flea and a fly flew up the flue. Of all the smells I have ever smelt, I have never smelt a smell that smelt like that smell smelt. The sixth sick Sheik's sixth sheep's sick.

Its Origins and UsageJanuary 6th, 2015When I was very little (less than 5 years old), all the kids in my neighborhood used to chant, 'How now brown cow!' It turns out that the phrase originally came from Scotland in the 1700's.  Some sources say that, 'brown cow' was a phrase that used to mean a barrel of beer because a barrel of beer is brown and ungainly like a cow.  Other sources said 'brown cow' just referred to the beer and that people could order another beer by saying, 'How now brown cow.' More recently, 'brown cow' can refer to a root beer float (i.e. vanilla ice cream floating in root beer soda).  The phrase, 'How now brown cow' has been used as a pronunciation exercise (like 'The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain').  It has also been used as a playground chant in some parts. I find it interesting how I still remember this chant after so many years… 'How now brown cow!'

In late 1774, Colonial leaders adopted the Suffolk Resolves in resistance to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party. The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities.

Explain to a third-grader: where was the statue of liberty originally built,ETA3G,"""As the actual statue was being built in France""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Statue of Liberty stands proudly on Liberty Island in New York Harbor. France gave the Statue of Liberty to the United States, and it was dedicated on Oct. 28, 1886. French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi designed the Statue of Liberty, and Gustave Eiffel built the metal framework. The Statue of Liberty is a beloved icon of freedom, and it was historically a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving by sea to the United States. The Statue Design and Construction Process Bartholdi traveled to the United States to explore potential sites for the statue. When he saw what would later be named Liberty Island, he immediately recognized this spot as the point that vessels usually sailed past when arriving in the United States. He spoke with President Ulysses S. Grant about using the island for the monument, and Grant agreed to reserve the site for the statue. Bartholdi made the first model concept in 1870. Creating the Statue of Liberty A Brief History of the Statue of Liberty </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The building project began in 1875. The French were going to pay for the statue, while the Americans had to pay for the pedestal. France raised funds for the statue's construction, and Bartholdi actually began building parts of Lady Liberty's right arm before the plans were fully finalized. Bartholdi then focused on building the head before bringing on Gustave Eiffel to work on the statue's structure. Eiffel used a curtain-wall construction technique that made the exterior of the statue not need to be load-bearing. The strength of the statue comes from its interior framework. The Construction of the Statue of Liberty Fundraising and Construction </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> As the actual statue was being built in France, people in New York were working to get the space ready to build the monument on. Fundraising efforts, including contests, benefits and exhibitions were held in the US to raise money for the construction of the pedestal that Liberty would be placed upon. It fell to American Architect Richard Morris Hunt to find a place to build the pedestal and begin designing it Liberty Island Before Liberty Arrived You may now know the island on which Liberty stands as 'Liberty Island'. In fact, this name was only given to the island in 1956. Before this, the island was called Bedloe's Island and held nothing more than old stone and long-forgotten memories. Fort Wood on Bedloe's Island </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, within New York City. The copper statue, a gift to the U.S. from the people of France, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue is a figure of Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776, in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken chain and shackle lie at her feet as she walks forward, commemorating the national abolition of slavery following the American Civil War. After its dedication the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, being subsequently seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea. The idea for the statue was born in 1865, when the French historian and abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye proposed a monument to commemorate the upcoming centennial of U.S. independence (1876), the perseverance of American democracy and the liberation of the nation's slaves. The Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the people of France finance the statue and the United States provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions. The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar (equivalent to $34 in 2023). The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The statue is situated in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island south of Ellis Island, which together comprise the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Both islands were ceded by New York to the federal government in 1800.

It was designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, a sculptor and the metal framework was made by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. There is a lot of history behind the Statue of Liberty, as it was a gift from the people of France to the people of United States to raise a monument together to commemorate the independence of the U.S. The statue is a figure of Libertas, which is a robed Roman liberty goddess. Lady Liberty with her right hand holds a torch above her head, and with her left hand carries a tabula ansata with the inscription JULY IV MDCCLXXVI that translates July 4, 1776 in Roman numerals, marking the date of the United States Declaration of Independence. She has a broken shackle and chain that lies at her feet as she is moving forward, in representation of the recent national abolition of slavery. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886, and after this it became a beacon of freedom and as a welcome symbol to the United States seen by immigrants that arrived by sea. Both Bartholdi and Laboulaye thought about how to best represent the idea of American liberty. There was a relevant female icon in American culture that was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom that was widely worshipped in ancient Rome, and more so amongst slaves. And since a Liberty figure adorned most American coins at the time, it seemed the perfect fit to have her represent this iconic monument. Bartholdi required the assistance of an experienced engineer to handle the structural issues that were associated with the design of such a colossal copper structure, and he commissioned Alexandre Gustave Eiffel to design the great iron pylon and secondary skeletal framework. There was some trouble to raise funds to build the Statue of Liberty from both sides of the Atlantic ocean at the time. However, both countries used several ways to raise funds to help build the statue through various forms of entertainment, art exhibits, auctions, and more. Thanks to the combined effort of both countries, the Statue of Liberty was finished in July 1884 and arrive to New York Harbor in June 1885 onboard the French frigate 'Isere.' It had to be reduced to 350 individual pieces and packed in 214 craters to be moved. The pedestal was designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt in 1884, donating his fee to help with the Statue's funding. It took 4 months to get The Statue reassembled on her new pedestal. President Grover Cleveland oversaw the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in front of thousands of people. The original name of Liberty Island was Bedloe's Island, and was renamed by the United States Congress in 1956. The Statue of Liberty construction starts in 1865, with Edouard de Laboulaye – a French political intellectual and anti-slavery activist – and his proposal of a statue representing liberty be made for the United States. This structure would be built to honor the celebration of one hundred years of independence and to celebrate the friendship with France. The idea of Edouard was supported by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi and they began designing the statue of 'Liberty Enlightening the World' in 1870. Bartholdi took a trip to the United States to find the ideal spot to place this iconic monument. During his travel he picked Bedloe's Island, currently known as Liberty Island, as the site for the Statue. Even though the island was quite small, he envisioned it as the 'gateway to America' since it would be visible to every ship that would enter New York Harbor. The Statue of Liberty construction actually began in 1876, where French craftsmen and artisans began building the Statue in France with the direction of Bartholdi. The Statue was completed by pieces in both countries in the span of 10 years.

The Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the people of France finance the statue and the United States provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions. The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882.

She scored a Top Ten hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1971 with the song 'I'm Gonna Run Away From You'. Career Gloria Brown was born in Gert Town, New Orleans, Louisiana. She attended school with Allen Toussaint and Ellis Marsalis Jr., and sang in church choirs, and with visiting groups such as the Clara Ward Singers, as well as in a school production of Show Boat. She also sang gospel music on WMRY radio shows, and after substituting for an absent performer and being discovered by local musician Alvin 'Red' Tyler, began performing rhythm and blues songs in local clubs. Taking the stage name Tami Lynn, she was heard by Allen Toussaint and Harold Battiste, signed for AFO Records, and toured with other company artists, before singing in New York City as an opening act for John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Ella Fitzgerald. Jerry Wexler heard Lynn sing at a convention in 1965. Wexler had her record the Bert Berns penned and produced song, 'I'm Gonna Run Away From You', for Atco Records, but the song was not released at the time, although it was released in the UK on Atlantic (AT.4071). In 1971, 'I'm Gonna Run Away From You' was released as a single, with 'The Boy Next Door' as the B-side, on Mojo and Atlantic, where it became a hit in the UK among devotees of Northern soul. The tune hit number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in 1971. A full-length album, Love Is Here and Now You're Gone, followed in 1972, produced by John Abbey, and was reissued on CD in 2005 by DBK Works.

She also recorded with King Floyd, Wilson Pickett, and Sonny & Cher, and performed with other musicians including Miles Davis, Irma Thomas and Joe Cocker. 'I'm Gonna Run Away From You' returned to the UK Singles Chart in 1975 after being reissued, hitting number 36 the second time around. Following the song's success, Lynn toured with Dr. John. Another album was the 1992 funk CD, Tamiya Lynn. In 2008, she appeared at the Ponderosa Stomp. Lynn lived in New York City for many years, before moving to Florida. In 2014, she performed in concert at New Port Richey, Florida, with guitarist Matthew Colthup. She died in Florida on June 26, 2020.

Explain to a third-grader: how many types of cheese are produced in france,ETA3G,"""While France is best known for soft ripened cheeses such as Brie and Camembert, there are several hundred other varieties of French Cheese made throughout the country""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> French cheeses are often named after the town or region where they're made. Some cheeses have been awarded the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) designation, which means the ingredients and the expertise to make it are tied to a specific region, and only cheeses made in a traditional way or from that specific place can use the name. There are 63 AOC designated French cheeses today. You can categorize French cheeses by how they are made: Pressed cheeses This is a cheese which is pressed into a large mold while it's made, and you buy pieces of it from the cheesemonger, rather than a whole round. Popular types of pressed cheese include Comté and the softer Reblochon. Soft cheeses These are the typical oozy cheeses you buy with a soft rind, like Brie or Camembert. Blue cheeses Cheeses that are shot through with different types of mold, giving it a blue-veined appearance. The most famous is Roquefort, aged in caves in southern France. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> In 2018, the most consumed cheese by the French was Emmental, from Switzerland! There is quite a bit of Emmental produced in France as well, to be fair. But a close second was the creamy Camembert. Raclette is also a popular choice. This is the name of both the type of cheese and a dish, originally Swiss but enjoyed particularly in the regions neighboring Switzerland. Raclette cheese is a semi-hard cow's milk cheese and traditionally part of the wheel of cheese is cut open, and melted with a heat source. The now soft, melty cheese is scraped onto a plate and eaten with boiled potatoes, bread, and pickles. However, at home, many people have a raclette grill with little pans to hold a slice of the cheese while it is melted by heating elements directly above the pan. Which countries produce the most cheese? </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union, certain established cheeses, including many French varieties, are covered by a protected designation of origin (PDO), and other, less stringent, designations of geographical origin for traditional specialities, such as the EU Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). The systems has largely replaced national systems, such as the French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system, as any cheese registered as a PDO or PGI can not use the designation AOC anymore in order to avoid confusion. French cheese production is classified under four categories, and PDO/PGI/(AOC) rules dictate which category or categories each protected cheese may be assigned to: Fermier: farmhouse cheese, which is produced on the farm where the milk is produced. Artisanal: producer producing cheese in relatively small quantities using milk from their own farm, but may also purchase milk from local farms. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> While France is best known for soft ripened cheeses such as Brie and Camembert, there are several hundred other varieties of French Cheese made throughout the country. The regions surrounding Paris and to its northwest specialize in soft ripened cheeses such as the famous Brie and Camembert, while areas to the east tend to produce harder cheeses like Emmental and Comte. The Basque region in the south of France is home to Ossau-Iraty, a delectable semi-soft sheep's milk tomme. No matter your taste, there is a Fromage for you! Many French Cheese types are protected under Appellation d'Origine Controlee (AOC), the highest level of protection by law. AOC law requires that in order to use the AOC insignia, an eligible French Cheese must be produced in a traditional manner in a determined geographic area of France from local milk. igourmet.com offers a full selection of French Cheese such as Brie - The French 'King of Cheese', Camembert, Gruyere de Comte, Roquefort and many more. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> French Monastery CheesesMany claim that the tradition of French Cheese making actually began in the monasteries of France in the Middle Ages. Bread and cheese were basic staples of monks' diets, and a large part of the monks' time was spent tending to livestock and the surrounding land. It is believed that by the 16th century, monks had created over 50 varieties of French Cheese. Many of these cheeses, like Port Salut, Saint Nectaire and Saint Paulin, are still made today. Known for its orange rind, Port Salut is a mild, semi-soft natural cheese. St. Nectaire, made in the mountainous Auvergne region of France, is a mild, fruity and buttery cheese, and Saint Paulin is a creamy semi-soft cow's milk cheese made by France's Trappist monks. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Centre-Val de Loire is the region just south of Paris, a region of wide open green spaces that follows its main river, the Loire. It is best known for its spectacular Loire Valley châteaux, home to French kings, queens, and nobility for centuries. The region is best known for its goat cheese, and 6 varieties have attained AOC status. The unpasteurized soft goat cheese Sainte-Maure-de-Touraine is perhaps the most well-known cheese of the region. The cheese is shaped as a log, with a distinctive grey mould rind, rolled in ash, traditionally with a length of straw running through its centre. Another unpasteurized goats cheese local to the region is Selles-sur-Cher, a wheel of soft cheese with a strong taste and a blue-grey rind. Another goat cheese is Valençay, which is formed in distinctive pyramid shapes. Some cows' milk cheeses are produced here too, such as Olivet Cendré, a soft cheese with delicate and salty taste, and a grey ash-coloured rind.

Explain to a third-grader: who makes history the leader or the mass movement,ETA3G,"""Leaders of mass movements provide direction that gives shape to popular discontent""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Hoffer states that mass movements begin with a widespread 'desire for change' from discontented people who place their locus of control outside their power and who also have no confidence in existing culture or traditions. Feeling their lives are 'irredeemably spoiled' and believing there is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual, true believers seek 'self-renunciation'. Thus, such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives in a larger collective. Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts. While mass movements are usually some blend of nationalist, political and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: 'All mass movements are competitive' and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and 'all mass movements are interchangeable'. As examples of the interchangeable nature of mass movements, Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for the same type of angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals. Part 2. The Potential Converts </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Mass movements demand a 'total surrender of a distinct self'. One identifies the most as 'a member of a certain tribe or family,' whether religious, political, revolutionary, or nationalist. Every important part of the true believer's persona and life must ultimately come from their identification with the larger community; even when alone, the true believer must never feel isolated and unwatched. Hoffer identifies this communal sensibility as the reappearance of a 'primitive state of being' common among pre-modern cultures. Mass movements also use play-acting and spectacle designed to make the individual feel overwhelmed and awed by their membership in the tribe, as with the massive ceremonial parades and speeches of the Nazis. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Fanaticism is encouraged in mass movements. Hoffer argues that 'the fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure' and thus uses uncompromising action and personal sacrifice to give meaning to his life. Part 4. Beginning and End Hoffer identifies three main personality types as the leaders of mass movements, 'men of words', 'fanatics', and 'practical men of action'. No person falls exclusively into one category, and their predominant quality may shift over time. Mass movements begin with 'men of words' or 'fault-finding intellectuals' such as clergy, journalists, academics, and students who condemn the established social order (such as Trotsky, Mohammed, and Lenin). The men of words feel unjustly excluded from or mocked and oppressed by the existing powers in society, and they relentlessly criticize or denigrate present institutions. Invariably speaking out in the name of disadvantaged commoners, the man of words is actually motivated by a deep personal grievance. The man of words relentlessly attempts to 'discredit the prevailing creeds' and creates a 'hunger for faith' which is then fed by 'doctrines and slogans of the new faith'. A cadre of devotees gradually develops around the man of words, leading to the next stage in a mass movement. Eventually, the fanatic takes over leadership of the mass movement from the man of words. While the 'creative man of words' finds satisfaction in his literature, philosophy or art, the 'noncreative man of words' feels unrecognized or stifled and thus veers into an extremism against the social order. Though the man of words and the fanatic share a discontent with the world, the fanatic is distinguished by his viciousness and urge to destroy. The fanatic feels fulfilled only in a perpetual struggle for power and change. Examples include Jean-Paul Marat, Maximilien de Robespierre, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The focus shifts from immediate demands for revolution to establishing the mass movement as a social institution where the ambitious can find influence and fame. Leadership uses an eclectic bricolage of ideological scraps to reinforce the doctrine, borrowing from whatever source is successful in holding the attention of true believers. For example, proto-Christians were fanatics, predicting the end of the world, condemning idolatry, demanding celibacy and sowing discontent between family members, yet from those roots grew Roman Catholicism, which mimicked the elaborate bureaucratic structure of the Roman Empire, canonized early Christians as saints, and borrowed pagan holidays and rites. In the absence of a practical man of action, the mass movement often withers and dies with the fanatic (Nazism died as a viable mass movement with Hitler's death). There are, of course, rare leaders such as Lincoln, Gandhi, even F.D.R., Churchill, and Nehru. They do not hesitate to harness man's hungers and fears to weld a following and make it zealous unto death in service of a holy cause; but unlike a Hitler, a Stalin, or even a Luther and a Calvin, they are not tempted to use the slime of frustrated souls as mortar in the building of a new world.... They know that no one can be honorable unless he honors mankind'.— p. 147 Hoffer argues that the length of the 'active phase' of a mass movement, the most energetic phase when fanatics are in control, can be predicted with some accuracy. Mass movements with a specific goal tend to be shorter-lived and feature less terror and bloodshed (such as the American Revolution). In contrast, an amorphous goal tends to result in a longer active phase of decades rather than months or years and also include substantially more bloodshed (such as the Bolsheviks in Russia, National Socialism in Germany). </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Leaders of mass movements provide direction that gives shape to popular discontent. In addition to organizing the masses, their key task is to formulate an alternative policy proposal or reform agenda to rally support among dissatisfied citizens to replace the status quo. However, the interests of leaders and their followers are seldom the same. First, the preferences of different individuals are naturally different: some prefer radical solutions, while others prefer more moderate ones. In addition, the stakes are much higher for leaders, and the possible sanctions they face are also higher. Furthermore, leaders are well informed about the political situation because they are specialized political actors, while the masses are generally less informed because the extent of their involvement in the movement is much smaller. These systematic differences present an agency problem in the relationship between leaders and their followers. In this paper, we analyze how this agency problem may distort the reform agenda of opposition leaders. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> In making history the masses have traversed a course of gradually developing from being unaware to being aware. The founding of the Marxist materialist conception of history showed the objective laws of the development of society and history, bringing the role of the masses in making history to a new stage and opening up a broad avenue for mankind to leave the realm of necessity in which man is blindly at the disposal of history and enter the realm of freedom in which man will consciously handle history. As Chairman Mao has put it, 'The epoch of world communism will be reached when all mankind voluntarily and consciously changes itself and the world.' So that this day will come the proletariat and revolutionary people still need to go through arduous and tortuous struggles, which must be led by a proletarian political party if it is to win victory. The mass line formulated by Chairman Mao for our Party requires us to have faith in the masses, to rely on them, respect their initiative, learn wholeheartedly from them and, at the same time, to indefatigably educate them in Marxism-Leninism, steadily raise their level of political consciousness and lead them to forge ahead. Lenin said: 'A party is the vanguard of a class, and its duty is to lead the masses and not merely to reflect the average political level of the masses.' (The Extraordinary All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies. [LCW 26:324]) Uphold the Marxist principle that the masses are the makers of history and adhere to the Party leadership—this is the only way to ensure that our revolutionary cause will continue to move ahead victoriously along the correct path. _______________ </p>",2025-11-19 19:45:41-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Explain to a third-grader: who commissioned the first christmas card in 1943,ETA3G,,"<p><b>Source 1:</b> A Christmas card is a greeting card sent as part of the traditional celebration of Christmas in order to convey between people a range of sentiments related to Christmastide and the holiday season. Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including some non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads 'wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year'. There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer, Christmas song lyrics or Biblical verse; others focus on the general holiday season with an all-inclusive 'Season's greetings'. The first modern Christmas card was by John Calcott Horsley. A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves. History The world's first commercially produced Christmas card, designed by John Callcott Horsley for Henry Cole in 1843 Children looking at Christmas cards in New York 1910 Christmas card by Louis Prang, showing a group of anthropomorphized frogs parading with banner and band. The first known Christmas card was sent by Michael Maier to James I of England and his son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1611. It was discovered in 1979 by Adam McLean in the Scottish Record Office. It was hand-made and incorporated Rosicrucian imagery, with the words of the greeting – 'A greeting on the birthday of the Sacred King, to the most worshipful and energetic lord and most eminent James, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Defender of the true faith, with a gesture of joyful celebration of the Birthday of the Lord, in most joyand fortune, we enter into the new auspicious year 1612' – being laid out to form a rose. The first commercially available card was commissioned by Sir Henry Cole and designed by John Callcott Horsley in London 1843. The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor. Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each. Early British cards rarely showed winter or religious themes, instead favoring flowers, fairies and other fanciful designs that reminded the recipient of the approach of spring. Humorous and sentimental images of children and animals were popular, as were increasingly elaborate shapes, decorations and materials. At Christmas 1873, the lithograph firm Prang and Mayer began creating greeting cards for the popular market in Britain. The firm began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874, thus becoming the first printer to offer cards in America. Its owner, Louis Prang, is sometimes called the 'father of the American Christmas card.' By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the chromolithography process of printmaking. However, the popularity of his cards led to cheap imitations that eventually drove him from the market. The advent of the postcard spelled the end for elaborate Victorian-style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day, including Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card. The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand Hallmark Cards was established in 1913 by Joyce Hall with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards. The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of World War I increased demand for cards to send to soldiers. The World Wars brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic 'studio cards' with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of Victorian and Edwardian cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004. Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters – especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone. Some card manufacturers now provide E-cards. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period. In mostly non-religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are called New Year Cards; they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols. Official Christmas cards President Johnson's 1967 White House Christmas card 'Official' Christmas cards began with Queen Victoria in the 1840s. The British royal family's cards are generally portraits reflecting significant personal events of the year. There is a long-standing custom for the American President and First Lady to send White House Christmas Cards each holiday season. The practice originated with President Calvin Coolidge, who was the first president to issue a written statement of peaceful tidings during the holidays in 1927. President Herbert Hoover was the first to give Christmas notes to the White House staff, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to utilize the card format (rather than the previously used notes or a written statement) that most closely resembles the Christmas cards of today. In 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first official White House card. The cards usually depict White House scenes as rendered by prominent American artists. The number of recipients has snowballed over the decades, from just 2,000 in 1961 to 1.4 million in 2005. Commercial Christmas cards Tucker Corporation Christmas Card, 1947 Many organizations produce special Christmas cards as a fundraising tool. The most famous of these enterprises is probably the UNICEF Christmas card program, launched in 1949, which selects artwork from internationally known artists for card reproduction. The UK-based Charities Advisory Trust used to give out an annual 'Scrooge Award' to the cards that return the smallest percentage to the charities they claim to support although it is not universally well received by the Christmas card producers. The RSPB produced the first ever charity Christmas card in 1898, selling 4,500 that year  Christmas stamps and stickers Santa Coming Down the Chimney Many countries produce official Christmas stamps, which may be brightly coloured and depict some aspect of Christmas tradition or a Nativity scene. Small decorative stickers are also made to seal the back of envelopes, typically showing a trinket or some symbol of Christmas. From the beginning, Christmas cards have been avidly collected. Queen Mary amassed a large collection that is now housed in the British Museum. The University College London's Slade School of Fine Art houses a collection of handmade Christmas Cards from alumni such as Paula Rego and Richard Hamilton and are displayed at events over the Christmas season, when members of the public can make their own Christmas cards in the Strang Print Room. Specimens from the 'golden age' of printing (1840s–1890s) are especially prized and bring in large sums at auctions. In December 2005, one of Horsley's original cards sold for nearly £9,000. Collectors may focus on particular images like Santa Claus, poets, or printing techniques. The Christmas card that holds the world record as the most expensive ever sold was a card produced in 1843 by J. C. Horsley and commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole. The card, one of the world's first, was sold in 2001 by UK auctioneers Henry Aldridge to an anonymous bidder for a record breaking £22,250. </p>",2025-11-19 19:35:54-08:00,True,"The answer is missing one or more double-quotation marks.

The council is also responsible for overseeing the complex and dangerous work of the UN's more than two dozen peacekeeping and political missions. Many see the council as dominated by its five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States), who, in addition to their veto power, can leverage their tenure, institutional memory and greater resources to determine council outcomes. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> As such, it can, for example, recommend procedures or methods for peaceful settlement of disputes, authorize use of force, implement a peacekeeping operation, create sanctions regimes, establish international criminal courts or extend the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Under the Charter of the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council is made up of five permanent members with veto rights. These permanent members are France, the United States, Russia, China and the United Kingdom. The Security Council also has ten elected members. They are elected by the United Nations General Assembly for a two year term. France is a permanent member of the Security Council. What does that mean? France was one of the UN's founding members in 1945. It is a Security Council member and has a permanent seat like the United States, China, United Kingdom and Russia, under the Charter of the United Nations. As a nuclear-weapon State and intervention and mediation power present in numerous theatres of operation, including within peacekeeping operations, France plays a leading role in the management of numerous international crises, the promotion of human rights and respect for international law, especially international humanitarian law in conflict environments. The five permanent members may use their veto to prevent a resolution from being adopted. France has not used its veto since 1989. What is the Presidency of the Security Council?

Countries pump a lot of money into their bids to get elected to the Security Council and it is estimated that Ireland spent over €840,000 on its efforts over the past three years while Norway and Canada each spent approximately €2 million. Such campaigns are interesting affairs and major charm offensives. For example, Ireland invited diplomats to a New York U2 concert in 2018 while Canada arranged a similar Celine Dion concert this year.

Explain to a third-grader: who helped the british in the french and indian war,ETA3G,"""each side being supported by various Native American tribes""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was a theater of the Seven Years' War, which pitted the North American colonies of the British Empire against those of the French, each side being supported by various Native American tribes. At the start of the war, the French colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers, compared with 2 million in the British colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on their native allies. Two years into the war, in 1756, Great Britain declared war on France, beginning the worldwide Seven Years' War. Many view the French and Indian War as being merely the American theater of this conflict; however, in the United States the French and Indian War is viewed as a singular conflict which was not associated with any European war. French Canadians call it the guerre de la Conquête ('War of the Conquest'). The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois, Catawba, and Cherokee tribes, and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy member tribes Abenaki and Mi'kmaq, and the Algonquin, Lenape, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Shawnee, and Wyandot (Huron) tribes. Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from the Province of Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north. It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River called the Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne at the location that later became Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754, during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> In a second British action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships. The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756. An early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July, 1754. The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with the Indians, since the allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding. The plan that the delegates agreed to was neither ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved by the Crown. Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.

The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758.

Facing defeat in North America and a tenuous position in Europe, the French Government attempted to engage the British in peace negotiations, but British Minister William Pitt (the elder), Secretary for Southern Affairs, sought not only the French cession of Canada but also commercial concessions that the French Government found unacceptable. After these negotiations failed, Spanish King Charles III offered to come to the aid of his cousin, French King Louis XV, and their representatives signed an alliance known as the Family Compact on August 15, 1761. The terms of the agreement stated that Spain would declare war </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The French and Indian War remains a crucial but often forgotten piece of American history. Here are 10 facts about the French and Indian War, a conflict that is often regarded as a spark that led to the American Revolution. Fact #1: It was part of a global warThe French and Indian War refers to the North American theater of the overarching global war known as the Seven Years' War in Europe. The French and Indian War was fought between Great Britain and France and their colonists, as well as Native American tribes. They fought over territories and expansion throughout North America.Fact #2: George Washington essentially set off the war in North America In 1754, Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, a 22 year old commander of British forces set off with his men towards the coveted Ohio River Valley to assist in building a fort. A small French company of soldiers led by Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville departed French Fort Duquesne to scout intelligence about British movements. When young Washington became aware of the French movement, he set out with his party to meet them, and ambushed them near Great Meadows in Pennsylvania. When the two sides met, Washington ordered his troops to fire, igniting a battle that resulted in the death of Ensign de Jumonville and 9 other French soldiers. After this battle, the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington moved his men into the Great Meadows, an open field, and crudely constructed Fort Necessity as a base. A few weeks later, French forces surrounded the British at Fort Necessity, forcing George Washington to surrender and unknowingly, due to poor translation, sign a document admitting to the assassination of Ensign de Jumonville. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Though often remembered as a frontier colonial war, the French and Indian War was in fact just one theater in a larger global war known as the Seven Years' War. The French and Indian War represented a clash of empires, people, and cultures, as international interests clashed over the future of the continent of North America.The entire global conflict erupted over a power struggle in the Ohio Valley between the British, the French, and the Native Americans. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish, Dutch, British, and French pioneers explored and colonized different parts of North America. The Spanish settled in the Southern and Western parts of the continent, the French in the Northern parts, the Dutch in the Northeast part, and the British on the eastern seaboard. As European explorers encountered American Indians on the continent, conflict often arose. The Europeans and Indians went through numerous periods of peace and warfare. As the various European colonists moved into different areas of the continent, it often brought them into conflict with each other. While the nations fought wars on the European continent, similar warfare broke out in the various colonies as they each struggled for supremacy of the North American continent. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The French and Indian War (1754-1763) is the name given to the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), a global conflict involving the major powers of Europe. Though war was not formally declared until 1756, armed conflict began in 1754 as disputes over land claims in the Ohio Valley lead to a series of frontier battles between the French and British. Both received support from various Native American tribes, though the outnumbered French became far more dependent on these allies as the war progressed. The French saw a number of early victories, most notably over George Washington and Edward Braddock in Western Pennsylvania. Washington quickly became a central figure in the conflict, maturing during his tenure in the Virginia militia from an inexperienced young major to the commander in chief of the colony's regiment. Washington's involvement during the war's early stages provided the future President with invaluable military experience while also gaining him positive notoriety that helped to launch his future political career. The tide turned in favor of the British in 1757 when King George II appointed Secretary of State William Pitt to commander of wartime operations.  Pitt believed that securing victories in North America would ensure Britain's global success, and reinvigorated the war effort by reorganizing military leadership and strengthening the Crown's relationship with its colonists in America. British assaults on strategic outposts such as Ticonderoga, Niagara, and Quebec in 1759, followed by the successful siege of Montreal in September of 1760, prompted the French surrender. Though Britain's victory in the French and Indian War expelled France from North America and secured massive territorial gains for the empire, subsequent Crown policies concerning taxation and westward expansion resulted in widespread colonial discontent. The conflict and its aftermath produced substantial ideological divisions between Britain and her North American colonies that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of the American Revolution. The French and Indian War was one of many French-British conflicts fought during the Second Hundred Years' War (1689-1815), a historical era that included King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's War (1702-1713) and King George's War (1744-1748). The struggle for control over North America that developed into the French and Indian War materialized in the mid-eighteenth century due to a dispute over French land claims in North America. Between 1700 and 1750, the colonial populations of Canada and Louisiana increased significantly, forcing expansion into the Ohio River Valley region. As settlement in this area and the Lower Mississippi Valley increased, New France increased her agricultural output and invested heavily in Louisiana's sugar economy. During this period, the French strengthened military ties and existing trade relationships with numerous Indian societies, sparking competition with the British for Indigenous allies. By 1749, population growth in the East and a desire for landed wealth from colonial elites prompted the Virginia House of Burgesses to issue large grants of territory in the West to private land companies, such as the Ohio Company. However, competing claims from the French challenged the Ohio Company's plan for future sale of these lands, prompting the colony of Virginia to initiate efforts toward halting the construction of French forts in western Pennsylvania and removing these rivals from the region. In late October of 1753, twenty-one-year-old George Washington, a major in the Virginia Militia, volunteered to deliver a message to the French on behalf of the colony's governor, Robert Dinwiddie. The ultimatum ordered that the French halt construction on Fort LeBoeuf in Western Pennsylvania and evacuate lands in the Ohio Valley, or else face an armed attack. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> The Seven Years' War pitted the alliance of Britain, Prussia and Hanover against the alliance of France, Austria, Sweden, Saxony, Russia, and eventually Spain. The war was driven by the commercial and imperial rivalry between Britain and France, and by the antagonism between Prussia (allied to Britain) and Austria (allied to France). In Europe, Britain sent troops to help its ally, Prussia, which was surrounded by its enemies. However, the main British war aim was to destroy France as a commercial rival, and they therefore focused on attacking the French navy and colonies overseas. France was committed to fighting in Europe to defend its ally, Austria. It therefore had few resources to spare for its colonies.

The French and Indian War was one of many French-British conflicts fought during the Second Hundred Years' War (1689-1815), a historical era that included King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's War (1702-1713) and King George's War (1744-1748). The struggle for control over North America that developed into the French and Indian War materialized in the mid-eighteenth century due to a dispute over French land claims in North America. Between 1700 and 1750, the colonial populations of Canada and Louisiana increased significantly, forcing expansion into the Ohio River Valley region. As settlement in this area and the Lower Mississippi Valley increased, New France increased her agricultural output and invested heavily in Louisiana's sugar economy. During this period, the French strengthened military ties and existing trade relationships with numerous Indian societies, sparking competition with the British for Indigenous allies. By 1749, population growth in the East and a desire for landed wealth from colonial elites prompted the Virginia House of Burgesses to issue large grants of territory in the West to private land companies, such as the Ohio Company. However, competing claims from the French challenged the Ohio Company's plan for future sale of these lands, prompting the colony of Virginia to initiate efforts toward halting the construction of French forts in western Pennsylvania and removing these rivals from the region. In late October of 1753, twenty-one-year-old George Washington, a major in the Virginia Militia, volunteered to deliver a message to the French on behalf of the colony's governor, Robert Dinwiddie. The ultimatum ordered that the French halt construction on Fort LeBoeuf in Western Pennsylvania and evacuate lands in the Ohio Valley, or else face an armed attack. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> The Seven Years' War pitted the alliance of Britain, Prussia and Hanover against the alliance of France, Austria, Sweden, Saxony, Russia, and eventually Spain. The war was driven by the commercial and imperial rivalry between Britain and France, and by the antagonism between Prussia (allied to Britain) and Austria (allied to France). In Europe, Britain sent troops to help its ally, Prussia, which was surrounded by its enemies. However, the main British war aim was to destroy France as a commercial rival, and they therefore focused on attacking the French navy and colonies overseas. France was committed to fighting in Europe to defend its ally, Austria. It therefore had few resources to spare for its colonies.

(Though the U.S. brethren of this species are called American bison, they're often referred to as buffalo.) Then bison hides became a popular fashion item, and the animals were hunted to near extinction by frontiersmen eager to make a buck—until the wares fell out of fashion. By 1902, less than 100 wild bison remained. This threatened the livelihood of Indigenous tribes who relied on the animals for sustenance, warmth, and ceremonial purposes. Careful viewers will note that the 1874 expedition is to Colorado—although Colorado didn't become a state until 1876. Director Gabe Polsky wrote the first draft of the screenplay in a Basalt library. 'I've been going to Colorado since I was a kid,' Polsky says. 'It's restorative. It's epic. And just part of my soul.' Though he's better known for his documentaries—including In Search of Greatness and Red Army—Polsky, 44, says his personal history with the Centennial State is what drew him to Williams' story.

Where he joins a team of buffalo hunters on a journey that puts his life and sanity at risk.What's so interesting about this film is the setting and how it delves into the characters psyche, it's a character study of sorts which shows the horrible nature of men and how they shot buffalo for sport. Nicholas Cage portrays the leader of the group, a terrific performance. The skinner, Fred Schneider, is portrayed by Jeremy Bobb and his character is probably the most well written one. He has this small amount of toxic masculinity and is a flawed character but when it comes to nature and animals, he's good. Xander Berkley's character serves no real purpose, making up for scenes which could easily be cut, only purpose he got is the role he got at the camp. My criticism is of the pacing, although I liked it I'm quite sure most will find it off putting. Also some of the writing, dialogue for example is often too modern but works, but also the writing of Nicolas Cage's character Miller, as the writing takes a nose dive for his character after half the film.

I still think the film is good, with Nicolas Cage doing a terrific job as well as the rest of the cast, along with the cinematography never disappointing.

Explain to a third-grader: who plays whitey bulger's girlfriend in black mass,ETA3G,"""Sienna Miller's role as Bulger's girlfriend Christine Greig""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Black Mass, unfortunately, is not a film noir. It could have been, perhaps even a great one, but instead it's resolutely a gangster film, chronicling the rise and fall of Boston's notorious Winter Hill gang, using a flashback structure that's largely dispassionate and aloof. Except, that is, when it zeroes in on the evil malevolence of gang leader James 'Whitey' Bulger—then Black Mass becomes something unique and perversely unsettling—a gangster film-horror movie hybrid. As portrayed by Johnny Depp, Bulger is the Devil incarnate, a psychotic manipulator whose notions of loyalty—and his (perhaps) chemically enhanced paranoia—drive him to compulsively murder the suspected traitors in his midst. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Sienna Miller's role as Bulger's girlfriend Christine Greig was cut entirely, which makes me suspect the filmmakers had intended to broaden and deepen the story, only to be cut off at the knees by the moneymen: a fast-paced gangster-horror hybrid was probably just what they wanted—character studies and moral dilemmas don't make for boffo box office. Personally, I'd have preferred more screen time for the women in Black Mass, all of whom give indelible performances—before each vanishes completely. A distaff perspective would have been such welcome respite from yet more scenes of guys shouting (albeit with Boston accents) 'No, fuck you!' at each other. (Note: the guys in the shitty suits shouting 'No, fuck you!' are the good guys; the guys in the horrible pleather jackets shouting 'No, fuck you!' are the bad guys.) </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Black Mass is a 2015 American biographical crime drama film about American mobster Whitey Bulger. Directed by Scott Cooper and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth, it is based on Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill's 2001 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob. The film features an ensemble cast led by Johnny Depp as Bulger, alongside Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Peter Sarsgaard, Dakota Johnson, and Corey Stoll. Principal photography of the film took place in Boston between May and August 2014. The film had its world premiere at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival and was released by Warner Bros. worldwide on September 18, 2015. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $100 million on a $53 million budget. Plot </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Johnny Depp's involvement with Black Mass dates back to February 2013, when he was attached to star in the film, while Barry Levinson was still slated to direct and principal photography was scheduled to begin in May 2013. Depp briefly exited the project shortly after its sale at the 66th annual Cannes Film Festival, because of a salary dispute with Cross Creek Pictures. He later rejoined at around the same time Scott Cooper was attached to replace Levinson as director, and his signing for the film was made official in February 2014. Jesse Plemons and Juno Temple joined the cast to play as Kevin Weeks (a cohort of Bulger) and Deborah Hussey, one of Bulger's victims, respectively, around April 2014. Plemons reportedly prepared for his role by hiring a dialect coach and studying video of the actual Kevin Weeks. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The roles of Connolly – who was Whitey Bulger's FBI handler – and his first wife Marianne, were filled by Joel Edgerton and Julianne Nicholson, respectively. Cooper chose Nicholson for the part after her performance as Sally in Sam Shepard's off-Broadway play Heartless (before Claire van der Boom succeeded her for the play's two-week extension). Edgerton developed his portrayal of Connolly by studying past footage of the FBI agent before his imprisonment, some of which include his appearances on talk shows and in courtrooms. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Edgerton stated that he declined trying to meet with the actual Connolly, reasoning that Connolly 'has one version of events and the film has a different version'. Edgerton originally dropped out of the project when Depp agreed to return, and Tom Hardy was in early talks for the role. However, Edgerton returned in the role. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> On June 9, Depp's 51st birthday, he was filming scenes on location in Quincy, while Dakota Johnson was in Back Bay, playing Whitey Bulger's longtime former girlfriend, Lindsey Cyr. On June 11, shooting was underway in Lynn, where the crew was filming scenes in which Bulger and Stephen Flemmi pick up a prostitute named Deborah Hussey (played by Juno Temple) from the police station. Temple was seen on the set. On June 16, Depp and Plemons were spotted on the set of the film in South Boston. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> On July 15, Cumberbatch wrapped filming for his part in Boston. On July 21, Depp filmed some scenes at the former Anthony's Hawthorne restaurant, located at Oxford Street and Central Avenue in Lynn, which wrapped up filming for his role. In July, director Cooper told The Boston Globe that filming had to take place for two more weeks in Boston, focusing on the FBI's role in the Bulger story. On July 25, Kevin Bacon was in Boston, filming some remaining scenes for the film. According to The Boston Globe, filming for Black Mass wrapped up on August 1, 2014, in Boston. Post-production Sienna Miller was cast and filmed scenes as Catherine Greig, Bulger's companion while a fugitive, but her scenes ended up getting cut from the film due to 'narrative choices'. Erica McDermott was cast as Mary Bulger, wife of Billy Bulger, but the majority of her scenes were cut out. Release </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> In Black Mass, Johnny Depp transforms into notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. Black Mass is based on the true story of gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. Author: Kim Holcomb and KING 5 Evening (KING) Published: 8:24 PM PDT September 17, 2015 Updated: 8:24 PM PDT September 17, 2015 SEATTLE - He's known for being something of a shape-shifter, and in Black Mass Johnny Depp transforms into notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger. 'I had done so much research and had seen photos of Jimmy Bulger, and to see him, the resemblance is uncanny,' said actress Dakota Johnson. The Fifty Shades of Grey star plays Bulger's girlfriend. She's just one member of an all-star cast who recreate the era when the gangster worked as an FBI informant in exchange for the agency turning a blind eye to his own criminal enterprise. </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> 'Black Mass,' about the tangled criminal history of Boston gang boss James 'Whitey' Bulger, is a bizarre movie. It really doesn't work until you tune into its wavelength. But if can do that, you may start to see method behind the film's madness and end up feeling as I did—that for all of its flaws, it's the first film since 'Eastern Promises' that has added anything truly fresh to the old school street-level gangster story.The general outlines wouldn't seem to promise anything like that sort of experience, and Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk's screenplay sometimes treats its flashback structure (articulated through FBI interrogations of key Bulger associates) as an excuse to tell, even summarize, rather than show. Testimonials become voice-over narration that papers over holes in the chronology. We meet Bulger and two powerful people who shield and enable him: his senator brother William 'Billy' Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his childhood friend turned FBI agent James Connolly (Joel Edgerton). We watch as Connolly hatches a plan to pay back Bulger, who protected him when they were kids, by helping the gangster inform on the Italian mob that's muscling in on his turf—essentially offering up the FBI as Bulger's unwitting private army, waging war on rivals. We meet Bulger's doting girlfriend Lindsey Cyr (Dakota Johnson) and his adorable son, Douglas Cyr (Luke Ryan), and of course Bulger's criminal gang; their ranks include Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, and the great W. Earl Brown, who's turning into the Warren Oates of modern urban potboilers. All of the performers are superb and have at least one indelible moment, but remain rather undefined as individuals. They fade in and out of the story willy-nilly, and sometimes when one of them shows up again you're surprised to see him because you forgot he was still alive. The sole exception is Peter Sarsgaard, whose supporting turn as a jumpy cokehead sums up a man's pathetic life in just four scenes. </p><p><b>Source 10:</b> Cyr dated Bulger for 12 years and said she knew nothing of his murderous dark side. She said she only saw a loving father to their son, Douglass.Dakota Johnson plays Cyr in Black Mass, but Cyr said scenes from the film misrepresent Bulger's relationship with his son, who died at age six after a severe reaction to medicine.''If you do something and no one sees it, you didn't do it,'' Cyr repeated a line from the movie. 'I would have smacked him in the back of the head and said, 'What the hell are you talking about?''Cyr does not give the movie high praise and said she's also critical of the U.S. attorney's new attempt to tack more time onto Catherine Greig's sentence as they try to determine how she and Bulger managed to elude capture for 16 years.'That woman never had a choice in anything that happened from the minute she said 'Yes dear I'll go with you,'' Cyr said.

Thanks to that, files could be transferred through the ARPANET network. But after his death, Shiva began his work on the email system and got it copyrighted as his software 'Email.' Shiva Ayyaduari claimed that he invented features like To, From, CC, BCC, Subject, Body, Attachments. Tomlinson argues with this fact, as he says many of these CC, From, BCC were his inventions. Shiva's vision was to invent something that everyone could use, from a secretary to a CEO for reliable sending and receiving of digital messages. Initial email history Around 2001, customers including American Express, Kmart, and Calvin Klein started using Email as a method of communication. Because of them, Emails' popularity increased all over the world. The main website of EchoMail states that the 'inventor of Email' is Ayyaduari. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Ray Tomlinson is universally credited as the creator of email as part of a program for ARPANET in 1971. Meanwhile in 1978, a 14-year-old boy, Shiva Ayyadurai began his work on an email system for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. His task was to emulate the paper-based interoffice mail system electronically and in 1982, he copyrighted his software, called 'EMAIL'. Ayyadurai as a 14-year-old. Ayyadurai's contention has been that while Tomlinson created a rudimentary system to send text messages, he is the one who build the email used in its present form today, and thus, should be credited as the inventor of email.

Back when computers were the size of entire rooms, everybody had to share. It's strange to think about because our mobile devices let us carry more computing power around in our pockets. But in the 1960s, computer nerds engineers had to sign up for time to work and shared the machine with others. Noel Morris and Tom Van Vleck were working at MIT in 1965 when they noticed a memo mentioning the idea of creating a mail command. The two looked into it and found no one had taken on the job yet. What they developed was a way to leave messages between people sharing computers. For example, you could let a colleague know their files had been backed up. Noel Morris was the brother of filmmaker Errol Morris who has blogged for the New York Times about Noel and Tom's contribution to the history of email. 1971: Ray Tomlinson invents email at ARPANET Most people give Ray Tomlinson the title of email's inventor. He came up with the idea while working for ARPANET, the government-funded research project that eventually became the internet. At the time, you could only leave messages for people using the same computer. Tomlinson created a program that gave users the ability to send messages between connected computers on the ARPANET system. The first email was sent between these two ARPANET computers Ray Tomlinson Among Tomlinson's most notable contributions to email as we know it today is the use of the @ symbol. Tomlinson passed away in 2016, but he lived to see his idea adopted by people all over the world. In 2012, Tomlinson told his story of the invention of email to The Verge and said people ended up using it just as he envisioned: 'ARPANET was very young and looking for problems it could solve. I had an experimental file-transfer protocol, but the real one was still in the works. I didn't want to wait for that, so I wrote a simple little one for my own use, and glued that onto the SNDMSG program so I could send the mailbox file to another computer, where the receiver's mailbox was. That was the first networked email in some sense.' Ray Tomlinson, 2012 interview with The Verge There is, however, some serious controversy over who really invented email. We'll tell you more in a few years... </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Also in 1976, Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign was the first to use email to communicate. Although, the former president steered clear of it later in life because he thought someone was spying on his conversations with foreign leaders. 1978: The birth of email spam It didn't take long for someone to find a way to use email to make money. Gary Thuerk earned the title 'father of spam' after sending an unsolicited marketing message to hundreds of ARPANET users in 1978. He was promoting a new product for Digital Equipment Corporation. Thuerk claims the email earned $13 million in sales. That sounds like pretty good engagement and a strong conversion rate. And email still gets incredible ROI. So, you have to wonder... With that kind of success, was this truly spam or the beginning of email marketing? While Gary Thuerk seems to embrace his spammy title, he told Computing World in 2007 that he prefers to think of himself as the 'father of e-marketing.' He also doesn't think we should blame him for spam. 'If the airline loses your luggage, do you blame the Wright Brothers?' Gary Thuerk, Father of spam and/or e-marketing 1978: The other inventor (or how email got its name) V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai The same year that Gary Thuerk started sending spam promotional messages, a teenager with an entrepreneurial drive was redefining workplace communications. V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai says a program he created as a 14-year-old is the true first version of email. Ayyadurai built his interoffice software program for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. He called it 'EMAIL.' Up until this point, people were still calling those messages electronic mail. So, it's quite likely that Ayyadurai helped coin and popularize the term 'email.' </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The late Jon Postel (known as the 'god of the internet') co-authored RFC 772, the precursor to SMTP ,with Suzanne Sluizer in 1980. Postel would later publish RFC 788 for SMTP as a way to replace File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for delivering emails. Of course, SMTP has issues - namely security and a way to verify the identity of a sender. In the early '80s, relatively few computers were connected to the early internet. The people using them knew each other and trusted other users. Suzanne Sluizer explained this to CNET in 2004 and actually suggested a new protocol was needed. 'Back in the time we were doing this work, we were talking about hundreds or maybe thousands of sites on what was then called the ARPANET ... It was a trusted situation, and the protocols were developed on the basis of that trust. So it's very surprising to me that we are using the same protocols coming up on 25 years later, because you need different things in a commercial environment than you need in a research environment.' Suzanne Sluizer Rather than getting rid of SMTP, email authentication protocols were introduced. That includes Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Domain-keys Identified Mail (DKIM). These authentication protocols help mailbox providers identify sending and help to stop email spoofing. Other email sending protocols include the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and the Post Office Protocol (POP), which would emerge in the mid '80s. 1988: Microsoft Outlook's ancestor MSMail in 1988 </p>",2025-11-20 09:12:11-08:00,False,Response is valid.
Explain to a third-grader: where can oxygen be found in the world,ETA3G,"""About 21% of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> A key component of the oxygen cycle occurs when plants and some types of bacteria take sunlight, water and carbon dioxide, and convert them to carbohydrates and oxygen, which are then cycled and used by other organisms that breathe oxygen. However, for half the time life has existed on Earth, there was no oxygen present, and for the first 1.5 billion years, it is not known how these systems worked, says University of Connecticut geoscientist Pieter Visscher, lead author of the study. A breakthrough happened when the research team discovered active microbial mats in the harsh conditions of Laguna La Brava in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The mats present an otherworldly set of conditions, like those of early Earth. They are in a unique environment that leaves them in a permanent oxygen-free state at high altitude. There they're exposed to wild, daily temperature swings, and high ultraviolet light conditions. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> It's important to remember that although the ocean produces at least 50% of the oxygen on Earth, roughly the same amount is consumed by marine life. Like animals on land, marine animals use oxygen to breathe, and both plants and animals use oxygen for cellular respiration. Oxygen is also consumed when dead plants and animals decay in the ocean. There is also oxygen in the atmosphere which has accumulated over hundreds of millions of years. As land animals, most of the oxygen humans breathe comes from this source. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Oxygen atoms are very reactive, and are incorporated into many common chemical compounds, such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur oxides (SO2 and SO3), and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2). About 21% of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen. This hasn't always been the case, though. Early in our planet's history, the atmosphere had almost no oxygen. Microbes that produce their food via photosynthesis generate oxygen as a by-product. Oxygen from photosynthetic microbes eventually built up in the atmosphere, drastically changing our planet's environment and the history of life in the process. Oxygen plays a critical role in respiration, the energy-producing chemistry that drives the metabolisms of most living things. We humans, along with many other creatures, need oxygen in the air we breathe to stay alive. Oxygen is generated during photosynthesis by plants and many types of microbes. Plants both use oxygen (during respiration) and produce it (via photosynthesis). </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The present-day distribution of oxygen in the internal deep ocean is thus determined by a complicated and not fully understood interplay of water circulation and bio­logical productivity, which leads to oxygen consumption in the ocean's interior. Extensive measurements have shown that the highest oxygen concentrations are found at high latitudes, where the ocean is cold, especially well-mixed and ventilated. The mid-latitudes, by contrast, especially on the western coasts of the continents, are characterized by marked oxygen-deficient zones. The oxygen supply here is very weak due to the sluggish water circulation, and this is further compounded by ­elevated oxygen consumption due to high biological productivity. This leads to a situation where the oxygen is almost completely depleted in the depth range between 100 and 1000 metres. This situation is also observed in the northern Indian Ocean in the area of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Globally, oceans have lost around 2% of dissolved oxygen since the 1950s and are expected to lose about 3–4% by the year 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), though the scale of effect is predicted to vary regionally. Much of the oxygen loss is concentrated in the upper 1000m where species richness and abundance is highest. Even slight overall reductions in the levels of oxygen dissolved in the oceans can induce oxygen stress in marine organisms by depriving them of an adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level (termed hypoxia). The loss of oxygen in the ocean has two major causes: Ocean warming-driven deoxygenation: Warmer ocean water holds less oxygen and is more buoyant than cooler water. This leads to reduced mixing of oxygenated water near the surface with deeper waters, which naturally contain less oxygen. Warmer water also raises oxygen demand from living organisms. As a result, less oxygen is available for marine life. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Virtually all the ocean's food provisioning ecosystem services for humans require oxygen to support organism growth and production. Oxygen is necessary to sustain the life of all the fishes and invertebrates, and deoxygenation is already causing measurable declines of fish species. Some of the ocean's most productive biomes, supporting one fifth of the world's wild marine fish harvest, are formed by ocean currents that bring nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor water to coasts that line the eastern edges of the world's ocean basins. As naturally oxygen-poor systems, these areas are particularly vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation, and such effects may ripple out and affect hundreds of millions of people. Degraded habitats caused by climate change-driven hypoxia and increased algal blooms may lead to reduced catches for fisheries and possible collapse of regional stocks. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> Oxygen first appeared in the Earth's atmosphere around 2 billion years ago, accumulating from the photosynthesis of blue-green algae. Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen passes into the atmosphere and the hydrogen joins with carbon dioxide to produce biomass.When living things need energy they take in oxygen for respiration. The oxygen returns to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Oxygen gas is fairly soluble in water, which makes aerobic life in rivers, lakes and oceans possible. Natural abundance Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere by volume. This is halfway between 17% (below which breathing for unacclimatised people becomes difficult) and 25% (above which many organic compounds are highly flammable). The element and its compounds make up 49.2% by mass of the Earth's crust, and about two-thirds of the human body. There are two key methods used to obtain oxygen gas. The first is by the distillation of liquid air. The second is to pass clean, dry air through a zeolite that absorbs nitrogen and leaves oxygen. A newer method, which gives oxygen of a higher purity, is to pass air over a partially permeable ceramic membrane.In the laboratory it can be prepared by the electrolysis of water or by adding a manganese(IV) oxide catalyst to aqueous hydrogen peroxide.

In this blog, let's take a look at the various objectives of financial management, and understand why achieving these financial management goals is vital for any business or individual to thrive. Goals of Financial Management At its core, the primary objective of financial management is to optimise financial resources for the betterment of an individual or an organisation, emphasizing effective financial planning.

Strategic financial planning varies by company, industry, and sector. Understanding Strategic Financial Management Strategic financial management is about creating profit for the business and ensuring an acceptable return on investment (ROI). Financial management is accomplished through business financial plans, setting up financial controls, and financial decision-making. Before a company can manage itself strategically, it first needs to define its objectives precisely, identify and quantify its available and potential resources, and devise a specific plan to use its finances and other capital resources toward achieving its goals. Strategic management also involves understanding and properly controlling, allocating, and obtaining a company's assets and liabilities, including monitoring operational financing items like expenditures, revenues, accounts receivable and payable, cash flow, and profitability. Strategic financial management encompasses furthermore involves continuous evaluating, planning, and adjusting to keep the company focused and on track toward long-term goals. When a company is managing strategically, it deals with short-term issues on an ad hoc basis in ways that do not derail its long-term vision. Strategic financial management includes assessing and managing a company's capital structure, the mix of debt and equity finance employed, to ensure a company's long-term solvency. Strategic Versus Tactical Financial Management The term 'strategic' refers to financial management practices that are focused on long-term success, as opposed to 'tactical' management decisions, which relate to short-term positioning. If a company is being strategic instead of tactical, it makes financial decisions based on what it thinks would achieve results ultimately—that is, in the future—which implies that to realize those results, a firm sometimes must tolerate losses in the present. 'Strategic' management focuses on long-term success and 'tactical' management relates to short-term positioning. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> A company will apply strategic financial management throughout its organizational operations, which involves designing elements that will maximize the firm's financial resources and use them efficiently.

However, some of the more common elements of strategic financial management could include the following. Planning Define objectives precisely.Identify and quantify available and potential resources.Write a specific business financial plan.

The value mindset The first step in VBM is embracing value maximization as the ultimate financial objective for a company. Traditional financial performance measures, such as earnings or earnings growth, are not always good proxies for value creation.

Explain to a third-grader: where did the battle of bonhomme richard take place,ETA3G,"""off the east coast of England""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> USS Bonhomme Richard was originally named the Duc de Duras, renamed after the ship was granted to John Paul Jones by the French during the American Revolution. The Duc de Duras was built around 1761 and measured 998 tons; it was bought by the French in 1769 and used primarily as an armed transport ship until given to John Paul Jones in 1779. Jones renamed the ship Bonhomme Richard (Good Man Richard) to honor Benjamin Franklin, as that was his French nickname. Duc de Duras was not in prime condition and Jones cut twelve ports on the gun-deck where he mounted six 18-pound guns. Bonhomme Richard carried a total of 42 guns. Bonhomme Richard is best known for its battle with HMS Serapis. Serapis was a British naval ship with 44 guns built in 1779 and commanded by Richard Pearson. Serapis was sent to protect merchant ships against piracy and on its first voyage was confronted by Bonhomme Richard. The battle took place on September 23, 1779 in the North Sea off Flamborough Head, England, and lasted over 3 hours. Though Serapis was better equipped, faster and more maneuverable, Richard Pearson surrendered Serapis to John Paul Jones. While Jones was able to win the battle, the Bonhomme Richard sank two days later, having sustained heavy damage during the battle. The painting shows three ships locked in combat, and it is possible that this painting is a time lapse scene of the battle. Men are visibly engaged in battle aboard the ships, and some crew members are hanging onto wreckage in the water. The Serapis's name is visible at the stern. Artist Thomas Buttersworth was born in 1768, on the Isle of Wight. He was a British painter who had spent time as a seaman. After his return to London in 1800, he was appointed Marine Painter of the East India Company. Buttersworth died in 1842. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Bonhomme Richard Grapples with Serapis while Alliance Fires into Bonhomme Richard (Naval History and Heritage Command) Pearson, recognizing his adversary's helplessness, demanded to know 'Has your ship struck?'  From across the distance, Jones called back, 'I have not yet begun to fight!'  Or, so that is how the fight went down in the some history books.  Historian Nathan Miller points out that the reply was not recorded until 1825, when the Richard's First Lieutenant, Richard Dale, gave it to an early Jones biographer.  Whether the battlecry was offered or not, the spirit raged on in the Bonhomme Richard's captain and crew.  Indeed, they were far from finished.  Jones and his crew were quick to lash the Richard and Serapis together at the point of contact and any other place they could reach.  With both ships entangled, American sharpshooters in the rigging began to ply their work to deadly effect while dropping grenades down onto Serapis. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The Bonhomme Richard and Serapis remained entangled for hours in darkness lit by a bright moon and constant muzzle flashes, the crew fighting amidst smoke generated by those guns, burning wood, and tar while trying to pump water out of the hulls as fast as it rose.  Jones himself had to join a gun crew on a 9 pounder when one of its crew was hit in the head.  Around ten o'clock, Gunner's Mate Henry Gardner emerged from below, where the water had risen to chin level, to discover the carnage was as bad above decks as below.  Assuming Jones and the first lieutenant were dead, he began calling for quarter to the British ship.  That was enough to distract Jones from his cannon.

Furious though he was, he wrote, 'I forbear to take any steps With him until I have the advice and approbation of your Excellency'. Captain Cottineau, on the other hand, placed himself under no such obligation, and called Landais a coward to his face.

Her design allowed her to be quickly transformed into a man-of-war in case of necessity to support the navy. She made two voyages to China, the first in 1766 and the second in 1769. At her return the French East India Company had been dissolved, and all its installations and ships transferred to the French Navy. As a naval ship she made a voyage to Isle de France (Mauritius) before being sold to private shipowners in 1771. She sailed in private service until she was purchased by King Louis XVI of France in early 1779 and placed under the command of John Paul Jones on 4 February. The size and armament of Duc de Duras made her roughly equivalent to half of a 64-gun ship of the line. Jones renamed her Bon Homme Richard (usually rendered in more correct French as Bonhomme Richard) in honor of Benjamin Franklin, the American Commissioner at Paris whose Poor Richard's Almanack was published in France under the title Les Maximes du Bonhomme Richard. First patrols On 19 June 1779, Bonhomme Richard sailed from Lorient accompanied by USS Alliance, Pallas, Vengeance, and Cerf with troop transports and merchant vessels under convoy to Bordeaux and to cruise against the British in the Bay of Biscay. Forced to return to port for repair, the squadron sailed again August 14, 1779. It went northwest around the west coast of the British Isles into the North Sea and then down the east coast. The squadron took 16 merchant vessels as prizes.

It all began with the wooden, 42-gun Continental Navy Bonhomme Richard. Originally built by France 1765 as a merchant vessel, Bonhomme Richard was propelled into history by legendary Navy Capt. John Paul Jones. On September 23, 1779, Jones steered Bonhomme Richard into the Battle of Flamborough Head against the British Warship HMS Serapis. After four hours of battling, the victory of Serapis seemed assured and the commanding officer of Serapis demanded Jones surrender. Jones reply is still one of the most well-known phrases in Naval history as he cried, 'Sir, I have not yet begun to fight!.' The battle continued, and although Bonhomme Richard had sustained irreparable damage, Serapis finally surrendered launching Jones and his crew into the annals of history. Bonhomme Richard sunk from the damage it sustained </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> While Bonhomme Richard's small arms were having a devastating effect on Serapis and her crew, the British cannons were as equally successful. During the third hour of the battle, Jones found himself with only three small 9-pounders left on the quarterdeck. When one of the gunners suffered a severe head injury, Jones himself took over and began firing at the enemy mainmast. While he was hunched over the gun, one of the crew came up from below, and not knowing it was Jones firing the weapon, assumed his commander had either surrendered or was dead. Gunner's Mate Henry Gardner grabbed two nearby crewmates and began to scream 'Quarter! Quarter!' Jones, hearing their cries, became enraged. Turning on the men, he chased them down the deck and finally hurled his pistol at Gardner, striking him in the head and rendering him unconscious. Pearson, meanwhile, heard the screams as well. 'Have you struck? Do you ask for quarter,' he called out across the deck of Bonhomme Richard, not even bothering to use his speaking trumpet as the two ships still lay lashed together. At that moment, Jones famously replied, 'I have not yet begun to fight!' </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> The Battle of Flamborough Head was fought September 23, 1779, between Bonhomme Richard and HMS Serapis and was part of the American Revolution (1775 to 1783).

The Duc de Duras was built around 1761 and measured 998 tons; it was bought by the French in 1769 and used primarily as an armed transport ship until given to John Paul Jones in 1779. Jones renamed the ship Bonhomme Richard (Good Man Richard) to honor Benjamin Franklin, as that was his French nickname. Duc de Duras was not in prime condition and Jones cut twelve ports on the gun-deck where he mounted six 18-pound guns. Bonhomme Richard carried a total of 42 guns. Bonhomme Richard is best known for its battle with HMS Serapis. Serapis was a British naval ship with 44 guns built in 1779 and commanded by Richard Pearson. Serapis was sent to protect merchant ships against piracy and on its first voyage was confronted by Bonhomme Richard. The battle took place on September 23, 1779 in the North Sea off Flamborough Head, England, and lasted over 3 hours. Though Serapis was better equipped, faster and more maneuverable, Richard Pearson surrendered Serapis to John Paul Jones. While Jones was able to win the battle, the Bonhomme Richard sank two days later, having sustained heavy damage during the battle. The painting shows three ships locked in combat, and it is possible that this painting is a time lapse scene of the battle.

After a fight with Julie over her son, David, Doug went to Addie's and she proposed to him. He accepted and the two of them were married. In 1974 they had a daughter together, Hope. After surviving leukemia, Addie died after being struck by a car pushing Hope's carriage out of the way just in time to save her daughter. Eventually, Julie, who had married and divorced Bob Anderson, reunited and the two of them married in a beautiful ceremony in 1976. Over the next few years, Doug and Julie would face many obstacles including the loss of Doug's Place (formerly Sergio's), Julie's rape and eventual trial for the murder of her rapist, and Julie being disfigured in a fire on Maggie's farm.

Explain to a third-grader: what dna changes produce the delta f508 mutation,ETA3G,"""The most common CF mutation, F508del, is primarily considered to be a processing mutation. The F508del mutation removes a single amino acid from the CFTR protein. Without this building block, the CFTR protein cannot stay in the correct 3-D shape. The cell recognizes that the protein isn't the right shape and disposes of it""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Over one thousand different mutant alleles of CFTR have been described. Any mutation that prevents CFTR from sufficiently transporting ions can lead to cystic fibrosis (CF). Worldwide, the most common CFTR allele among CF patients is called ΔF508 (delta-F508 or PHE508DEL), which is a deletion of three nucleotides that eliminates a phenylalanine (F) from position 508 of the 1480 amino acid wild-type protein. Mutation ΔF508 causes CFTR to be folded improperly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preventing CFTR from reaching the cell membrane. The allele ΔF508 accounts for approximately 70% of CF cases in North America, with ~1/25 people of European descent being carriers. The high frequency of the ΔF508 allele around the world has led to speculation that it may confer some selective advantage to heterozygotes, perhaps by reducing dehydration during cholera epidemics or by reducing susceptibility to certain pathogens that bind to epithelial membranes, although little data has been uncovered to support these hypotheses. However, recent mining of health data and genetic data from over 19,000 CFTR mutant allele heterozygotes suggests that heterozygotes exhibit an increased incidence of a variety of conditions including infertility, pancreatitis, diabetes, short stature, failure to thrive, constipation and scoliosis (Miller et al., 2020). </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The most common mutation worldwide is delta F508, which occurs in 75% of patients with CF in the UK. A three base-pair deletion in exon 10 of the CFTR gene results in the omission of phenylalanine (one of the bricks) at position 508 in the 1480 amino acid chain. A mutant CFTR protein which cannot be folded into its proper shape is produced. The quality control mechanisms within the cell destroy this abnormal protein before it can reach the cell surface where its major normal function is to act as a channel through which chloride ions can pass in and out of the cell. In other ethnic groups the range of mutations are different e.g. in Ashkenazi Jews delta F508 accounts for 27% and W1282X for 51% of the mutations (Kalman et al, 1994). Mode of inheritance and risk of passing on the CF gene </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The commonest polymorphism is the seven thymidine (7T) variant and the delta F508 mutation occurs exclusively on the 9T variant. This variation may be important in some CFTR mutations e.g. R117H. The presence of R117H/delta F508 on a background of 5T is associated with an elevated sweat test and clinical CF. R117H in association with 7T may result in normal, borderline or elevated sweat values and a variable clinical presentation (Kiesewetter et al, 1993; Rave-Harel et al, 1997; Massie et al, 2001; Peckham et al, 2006). Genotyping </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The CFTR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position q31.2 [9]. To date, over 1,900 sequence variations in the CFTR gene have been reported [10], although a detailed understanding of how CFTR mutations impact channel dysfunction is limited to a only a few of these [11]. This implies a relatively small list of well-defined CFTR mutations known to be CF disease causing, whereas the functional consequence of various rare sequence variations remains unknown or has been shown not to be CF disease causing [12]. The majority of identified CFTR gene mutations fall into one of six classes that account for ∼80% of all CF patients [9]. Of the &gt;1,900 CFTR mutations that have been identified so far, approximately only 20 mutations have a frequency &gt;0.1% [9]. In fact, notwithstanding the common F508del variant, only four CFTR mutations have a frequency &gt;0.1%: G551D, W1282X, G542X and N1303K, having a worldwide prevalence of around 1–3% each [9, 11]. F508del is the most common mutation with an allelic frequency of around 90% worldwide [13]. Mutation classification Class I and II CFTR mutations are typically characterised by a reduction in the quantity of expressed CFTR protein (fig. 1). Class I mutations can result from nonsense and frame-shift mutations, as well as mRNA splicing defects [14]. For example, G542X is a nonsense or stop mutation, where introduction of a premature termination codon (or stop codon) results in premature cessation of translation and production of truncated CFTR protein. Class II mutations, including F508del, have folding or maturation defects, which can result in premature CFTR degradation (fig. 1) [9]. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The most common mutation causing CF is a three-base pair deletion in the position of delta F508 (dF508), but there are now over 1800 mutations identified in the CFTR gene. The identification of increased immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in the blood of infants with CF has made neonatal screening for CF possible. Trypsinogen is one of the secretory products of the pancreas making its level in the blood a specific marker of pancreatic function. Detection of high levels of IRT in the newborn period place the infant at risk for CF.  Although there is no cure, newborns screened for cystic fibrosis can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment, which can: Improve growth Improve lung function Reduce hospital stays Add years to life </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The three mutations we studied affect approximately 1.5% of individuals with CF and do not disrupt the classical canonical splicing regions [20], rather they cause CF by creating strong alternative splice sites which result in formation of pseudoexons or extend existing exons in CFTR. The first mutation, c.1679+1634A&gt;G, creates a very strong splice acceptor in intron 12 of CFTR with 99% of transcripts containing a 49bp pseudoexon with an in-frame TAA stop codon in the pseudoexon causing premature termination of the CFTR protein [21], and is classified as a severe CF-causing mutation. The second, c.3140-26A&gt;G, creates a splice acceptor site 26 bp before exon 20 and therefore extends this exon by 25bp [22]. The resultant frameshift leads to premature termination of CFTR at a TGA stop codon. Whilst c.3140-26A&gt;G disrupts 95% of CFTR transcripts, the production of ~5% normal transcripts is thought to explain the milder CF phenotype observed in individuals with this mutation. The final mutation, c.3718-2477C&gt;T, creates a splice donor deep within intron 22 and leads to inclusion of an 84 bp pseudoexon (which contains an in-frame TAA stop codon) into the mRNA [23]. For individuals with c.3718-2477C&gt;T, the 10th most common CF allele [5], a wide range of aberrant splicing has been reported, with a strong correlation between the level of mis-splicing and severity of disease [24–26]. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The common delta F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interferes with the biosynthetic folding of nascent CFTR polypeptides, leading to their retention and rapid degradation in an intracellular compartment proximal to the Golgi apparatus. Neither the pathway by which wild-type CFTR folds nor the mechanism by which the Phe508 deletion interferes with this process is well understood. We have investigated the effect of glycerol, a polyhydric alcohol known to stabilize protein conformation, on the folding of CFTR and delta F508 in vivo. Incubation of transient and stable delta F508 transfectants with 10% glycerol induced a significant accumulation of delta F508 protein bearing complex N-linked oligosaccharides, indicative of their transit to a compartment distal to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This accumulation was accompanied by an increase in mean whole cell cAMP activated chloride conductance, suggesting that the glycerol-rescued delta F508 polypeptides form functional plasma membrane CFTR channels. These effects were dose- and time-dependent and fully reversible. Glycerol treatment also stabilized immature (core-glycosylated) delta F508 and CFTR molecules that are normally degraded rapidly. These effects of glycerol were not due to a general disruption of ER quality control processes but appeared to correlate with the degree of temperature sensitivity of specific CFTR mutations. These data suggest a model in which glycerol serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and subsequent release from the ER quality control apparatus. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Not only is there heterogeneity in the mutations causing Cystic Fibrosis, but the pathogenetic mechanisms also vary. Deletion of phenylalanine-508 appears to cause disease by abrogating normal biosynthetic processing and thereby resulting in retention and degradation of the mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations, such as the relatively common G551D mutation [4], appear to be normally processed and, therefore, must cause disease through some other mechanism. G551D mutation, which is within the first nucleotide-binding fold of the CFTR, is the third most common CF mutation, with a worldwide frequency of 3.1% among CF chromosomes [5]. Several mutations result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced [6]. </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> The most common CF mutation, F508del, is primarily considered to be a processing mutation. The F508del mutation removes a single amino acid from the CFTR protein. Without this building block, the CFTR protein cannot stay in the correct 3-D shape. The cell recognizes that the protein isn't the right shape and disposes of it.

Explain to a third-grader: what dna changes produce the delta f508 mutation,ETA3G,"""The common delta F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interferes with the biosynthetic folding of nascent CFTR polypeptides, leading to their retention and rapid degradation in an intracellular compartment proximal to the Golgi apparatus"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Over one thousand different mutant alleles of CFTR have been described. Any mutation that prevents CFTR from sufficiently transporting ions can lead to cystic fibrosis (CF). Worldwide, the most common CFTR allele among CF patients is called ΔF508 (delta-F508 or PHE508DEL), which is a deletion of three nucleotides that eliminates a phenylalanine (F) from position 508 of the 1480 amino acid wild-type protein. Mutation ΔF508 causes CFTR to be folded improperly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preventing CFTR from reaching the cell membrane. The allele ΔF508 accounts for approximately 70% of CF cases in North America, with ~1/25 people of European descent being carriers. The high frequency of the ΔF508 allele around the world has led to speculation that it may confer some selective advantage to heterozygotes, perhaps by reducing dehydration during cholera epidemics or by reducing susceptibility to certain pathogens that bind to epithelial membranes, although little data has been uncovered to support these hypotheses. However, recent mining of health data and genetic data from over 19,000 CFTR mutant allele heterozygotes suggests that heterozygotes exhibit an increased incidence of a variety of conditions including infertility, pancreatitis, diabetes, short stature, failure to thrive, constipation and scoliosis (Miller et al., 2020). </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The most common mutation worldwide is delta F508, which occurs in 75% of patients with CF in the UK. A three base-pair deletion in exon 10 of the CFTR gene results in the omission of phenylalanine (one of the bricks) at position 508 in the 1480 amino acid chain. A mutant CFTR protein which cannot be folded into its proper shape is produced. The quality control mechanisms within the cell destroy this abnormal protein before it can reach the cell surface where its major normal function is to act as a channel through which chloride ions can pass in and out of the cell. In other ethnic groups the range of mutations are different e.g. in Ashkenazi Jews delta F508 accounts for 27% and W1282X for 51% of the mutations (Kalman et al, 1994). Mode of inheritance and risk of passing on the CF gene </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The commonest polymorphism is the seven thymidine (7T) variant and the delta F508 mutation occurs exclusively on the 9T variant. This variation may be important in some CFTR mutations e.g. R117H. The presence of R117H/delta F508 on a background of 5T is associated with an elevated sweat test and clinical CF. R117H in association with 7T may result in normal, borderline or elevated sweat values and a variable clinical presentation (Kiesewetter et al, 1993; Rave-Harel et al, 1997; Massie et al, 2001; Peckham et al, 2006). Genotyping </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The CFTR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position q31.2 [9]. To date, over 1,900 sequence variations in the CFTR gene have been reported [10], although a detailed understanding of how CFTR mutations impact channel dysfunction is limited to a only a few of these [11]. This implies a relatively small list of well-defined CFTR mutations known to be CF disease causing, whereas the functional consequence of various rare sequence variations remains unknown or has been shown not to be CF disease causing [12]. The majority of identified CFTR gene mutations fall into one of six classes that account for ∼80% of all CF patients [9]. Of the &gt;1,900 CFTR mutations that have been identified so far, approximately only 20 mutations have a frequency &gt;0.1% [9]. In fact, notwithstanding the common F508del variant, only four CFTR mutations have a frequency &gt;0.1%: G551D, W1282X, G542X and N1303K, having a worldwide prevalence of around 1–3% each [9, 11]. F508del is the most common mutation with an allelic frequency of around 90% worldwide [13]. Mutation classification Class I and II CFTR mutations are typically characterised by a reduction in the quantity of expressed CFTR protein (fig. 1). Class I mutations can result from nonsense and frame-shift mutations, as well as mRNA splicing defects [14]. For example, G542X is a nonsense or stop mutation, where introduction of a premature termination codon (or stop codon) results in premature cessation of translation and production of truncated CFTR protein. Class II mutations, including F508del, have folding or maturation defects, which can result in premature CFTR degradation (fig. 1) [9]. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The most common mutation causing CF is a three-base pair deletion in the position of delta F508 (dF508), but there are now over 1800 mutations identified in the CFTR gene. The identification of increased immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in the blood of infants with CF has made neonatal screening for CF possible. Trypsinogen is one of the secretory products of the pancreas making its level in the blood a specific marker of pancreatic function. Detection of high levels of IRT in the newborn period place the infant at risk for CF.  Although there is no cure, newborns screened for cystic fibrosis can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment, which can: Improve growth Improve lung function Reduce hospital stays Add years to life </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The three mutations we studied affect approximately 1.5% of individuals with CF and do not disrupt the classical canonical splicing regions [20], rather they cause CF by creating strong alternative splice sites which result in formation of pseudoexons or extend existing exons in CFTR. The first mutation, c.1679+1634A&gt;G, creates a very strong splice acceptor in intron 12 of CFTR with 99% of transcripts containing a 49bp pseudoexon with an in-frame TAA stop codon in the pseudoexon causing premature termination of the CFTR protein [21], and is classified as a severe CF-causing mutation. The second, c.3140-26A&gt;G, creates a splice acceptor site 26 bp before exon 20 and therefore extends this exon by 25bp [22]. The resultant frameshift leads to premature termination of CFTR at a TGA stop codon. Whilst c.3140-26A&gt;G disrupts 95% of CFTR transcripts, the production of ~5% normal transcripts is thought to explain the milder CF phenotype observed in individuals with this mutation. The final mutation, c.3718-2477C&gt;T, creates a splice donor deep within intron 22 and leads to inclusion of an 84 bp pseudoexon (which contains an in-frame TAA stop codon) into the mRNA [23]. For individuals with c.3718-2477C&gt;T, the 10th most common CF allele [5], a wide range of aberrant splicing has been reported, with a strong correlation between the level of mis-splicing and severity of disease [24–26]. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The common delta F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interferes with the biosynthetic folding of nascent CFTR polypeptides, leading to their retention and rapid degradation in an intracellular compartment proximal to the Golgi apparatus. Neither the pathway by which wild-type CFTR folds nor the mechanism by which the Phe508 deletion interferes with this process is well understood. We have investigated the effect of glycerol, a polyhydric alcohol known to stabilize protein conformation, on the folding of CFTR and delta F508 in vivo. Incubation of transient and stable delta F508 transfectants with 10% glycerol induced a significant accumulation of delta F508 protein bearing complex N-linked oligosaccharides, indicative of their transit to a compartment distal to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This accumulation was accompanied by an increase in mean whole cell cAMP activated chloride conductance, suggesting that the glycerol-rescued delta F508 polypeptides form functional plasma membrane CFTR channels. These effects were dose- and time-dependent and fully reversible. Glycerol treatment also stabilized immature (core-glycosylated) delta F508 and CFTR molecules that are normally degraded rapidly. These effects of glycerol were not due to a general disruption of ER quality control processes but appeared to correlate with the degree of temperature sensitivity of specific CFTR mutations. These data suggest a model in which glycerol serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and subsequent release from the ER quality control apparatus. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Not only is there heterogeneity in the mutations causing Cystic Fibrosis, but the pathogenetic mechanisms also vary. Deletion of phenylalanine-508 appears to cause disease by abrogating normal biosynthetic processing and thereby resulting in retention and degradation of the mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations, such as the relatively common G551D mutation [4], appear to be normally processed and, therefore, must cause disease through some other mechanism. G551D mutation, which is within the first nucleotide-binding fold of the CFTR, is the third most common CF mutation, with a worldwide frequency of 3.1% among CF chromosomes [5]. Several mutations result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced [6]. </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> The most common CF mutation, F508del, is primarily considered to be a processing mutation. The F508del mutation removes a single amino acid from the CFTR protein. Without this building block, the CFTR protein cannot stay in the correct 3-D shape. The cell recognizes that the protein isn't the right shape and disposes of it. The drug combination Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) works by enabling CFTR protein with an F508del mutation to fold in a more correct shape, and then activates the protein to allow more chloride to pass through. Although this drug combination is not a perfect fix, it helps the mutant CFTR protein to move some chloride. This movement of chloride reduces the symptoms of CF.

However, flu symptoms also include fever, cold sweats, aches throughout the body, headache, exhaustion, and even some gastro-intestinal symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea (1). The flu is highly contagious. Adults are able to spread the virus one day prior to the appearance of symptoms and up to seven days after symptoms begin. Influenza is typically spread via the coughs and sneezes of an infected person (1). Around 200,000 people in the United States are hospitalized each year because of the flu, and of these people, about 36,000 die.  The flu is most serious for the elderly, the very young, or people who have a weakened immune system (1).

Explain to a third-grader: where does the phrase jumping the shark come from,ETA3G,"""In essence, jump the shark is a playful idiom when a TV series has lowered quality/artistic value""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The success of 'jumped the shark' led to the creation of two related idioms. 'Nuked the fridge' is the movie franchise equivalent of 'jumped the shark,' the moment when a film series goes from Oscar to Razzie. The phrase stems from a scene in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, where everyone's favorite archaeologist, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), avoids being killed by a nuclear explosion by placing himself inside a lead-lined refrigerator. Although some have posited that there's a reason why that worked that hails back to the events of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, 'nuked the fridge' has grown, much like its cousin. Examples include the Die Hard franchise and its 2013 entry A Good Day to Die Hard, or Tobey Maguire's emo Peter Parker dance/look thing in Spider-Man 3. Ponder this: the Jaws franchise 'nuked the fridge' with Jaws: The Revenge, but didn't 'jump the shark.' Discuss. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> For whatever reason, the phrase 'Jump the Shark' has been jumping out at me recently.  From the Jump the Shark Hat Tutorial to watching past episodes of Supernatural on Netflix to Cloud Computing to the many #jumptheshark tags added to tweeps tweets.  Originally linked to the Happy Days episode where the water-skiing Fonz jumps over a shark, it has since become the term to describe when writer's storylines have moved into the absurd and the show itself quickly deteriorates.  Today it is attached to almost anything that has either hung around too long, is past it's prime or is simply fallen off the hype-cliff.  I sometimes feel this way after producing a bunch of videos (like the last two weeks) and need to get back to writing...like this entry.  So I decided to investigate a couple recent hype technologies (that I also write about) and if they've already Jumped the Shark. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Future radio personality Jon Hein and his University of Michigan roommate Sean Connolly coined the phrase in 1985 in response to season 5, episode 3, 'Hollywood: Part 3' of the ABC-TV sitcom Happy Days, which was originally broadcast on September 20, 1977. In the episode, the central characters visit Los Angeles, where a water-skiing Fonzie (Henry Winkler) answers a challenge to his bravery by wearing swim trunks and his trademark leather jacket, and jumping over a confined shark. The stunt was created as a way to showcase Winkler's real-life waterskiing skills. In 1997, Hein created a website, JumpTheShark.com, to publish a list of approximately 200 television shows, and his arguments as to the moments each 'jumped the shark'. The site became popular, and grew with additional user-contributed examples. Hein sold his company, Jump The Shark, Inc., for 'over $1 million' in 2006. Response from Happy Days cast and crew Ron Howard </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The term jump the shark wasn't coined because of Jaws, but the ensuing Jawsmania after the release of the Steven Spielberg shark classic may have played a part in feeding the media's continued fascination with sharks...which is how we end up with The Fonz literally jumping over a shark in Happy Days. After the monster success of Jaws, sharks were everywhere, whether it was on The Six Million Dollar Man or the world of Hanna Barbara with Jabberjaw. One place you'd probably not expect to see a dorsal fin appear was on Happy Days. Yep, that's where this shark curveball takes us with The Fonz (Henry Winkler) water-skiing and jumping over a great white shark with Ritchie Cunningham (Ron Howard) driving the boat, Chief. And you can link Howard to Jaws, as he'd starred alongside Richard Dreyfuss in American Graffiti (1973), which was co-edited by Verna Fields who would on and win an Academy Award for her editing of Jaws. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> In essence, jump the shark is a playful idiom when a TV series has lowered quality/artistic value. For instance, a TV show is thought to have jumped the shark when there is a poor change in writing or when a bad plot twist ruins the story for fans. Examples Of Using Jump The Shark Man, I liked that show until it jumped the shark! It was going so well until the writing just became tacky and unbelievable! I think the show jumped the shark after season 3 when they began killing off my favorite characters. For the most part, I enjoyed the show, especially the beginning. However, after some more thought on it, I really can't shake the feeling that it jumped the shark about halfway through. Where Does Jump The Shark Come From? Most people believe that jump shark most likely originated from the popular TV show Happy Days. The term has been tracked down to a specific episode aired in 1977 called Hollywood. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The perils of a leader jumping the shark are multifaceted and significant, involving a loss of trust, alienation of supporters, and potential destabilization of the entire organization. In the realm of leadership, the phrase 'jumping the shark' has transcended its television roots to denote a critical, often detrimental, phase in a leader's trajectory. It characterizes the point at which a leader, in a bid to retain or recapture dwindling popularity, relevance, or influence, resorts to actions or decisions that are perceived as desperate, outlandish, or detached from reality. Rather than bolstering the leader's position, these actions often precipitate a decline in their credibility and effectiveness. A closely related danger is the alienation of core supporters. Leaders who jump the shark often deviate markedly from the foundational values and principles that initially garnered them support. This shift can alienate their most steadfast supporters, leaving leaders without the crucial backing they need to navigate challenges effectively. Moreover, in their pursuit of novelty or shock value, leaders might prioritize short-lived triumphs over long-term strategy and sustainability, jeopardizing the future stability and success of their organizations. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The origin of the phrase jump the shark is tucked neatly in that previous sentence: it comes from a 1977 episode of the American TV series 'Happy Days' (1974–1984) in which the program's most popular character, Fonzie, jumps over a shark while waterskiing in his trademark leather jacket. Some years later that episode came to be widely identified as marking the beginning of the iconic show's decline, and its plot device became a metaphor for similar transformations: Nearly all TV shows ever produced have jumped the shark eventually. Such is the nature of television's creative conundrum. — Monica Collins, Boston Herald, 9 Jan. 2000 Most TV series take three seasons to jump the shark, but in the theater it can happen in 20 minutes … — Bob Verini, Daily Variety, 18 Sept. 2009 But in its headlong embrace of capitalism and corporate tie-ins, 'Sex and the City' may have finally jumped the shark. — Laura Compton, San Francisco Chronicle, 30 May 2010 </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> First, let's define 'jumping the shark.' After talking to my client, I realized that the phrase is a generational cultural reference that not everyone understands. 'Jumping the shark' is the moment when something that was once popular is no longer popular or starts to decline in popularity. In other words, it's past its peak. This was popularized by the '70s TV series Happy Days in an episode where a waterskiing Fonzie answers a challenge to his bravery by wearing swim trunks with his trademark leather jacket and jumping over a confined shark.

The movie centers on a young German boy whose father is the commandante of a Nazi extermination camp.  The father is evil, a Nazi ideologue; his wife is horrified by what she knows is going on; the daughter joins the Hitler youth; and the boy, our protagonist, is too young to understand what is really going on inside the camp.  One day the boy sneaks out of his house and comes across a young Jewish boy sitting on the other side of the camp's electrified barbed-wire fence.  They talk for a while, then agree to keep meeting at the fence.  Slowly, over the course of a number of weeks, they become good friends.  The Jewish boy continually hints at the treatment to which he and his family are being subjected, but never explicitly discusses the killings that regularly take place in the camp. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is – or was for me – an incredibly moving and powerfully affecting film. It manages to make you feel how utterly evil Evil is. It also makes you feel how important and valuable every single human life is, and how tragic and terrible is its loss. The story centres on a German family – father, mother, young teenage daughter and most of all their 8-year-old son Bruno – during the Second World War. Bruno's father is a soldier, and at the start of the film he has just been promoted, meaning that the whole family must move to a new house in the country. Only gradually does it become clear that the father's new position is Commandant of an extermination camp – fairly obviously Auschwitz, though this is never spelt out. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas shows how terribly easy it is for humans to dehumanise and brutalise other humans, even to the extent of viewing and treating them as sub-human vermin to be controlled and exterminated (the ruling Hutus referred to the Tutsis as 'cockroaches' in the Rwandan genocide). And in the process how those doing the brutalising paradoxically become brutalised and dehumanised themselves. Humanity and the value of human life Conversely, the film shows up the potential goodness of humanity and the human spirit in stark contrast to the inhumanity and brutality to which other humans are subjecting it. It shows that, while the brutalisers become increasingly brutish, those who are being treated brutally can choose to retain their humanity and dignity in the face of everything. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The Boy with the Striped Pyjamas is largely told from the perspective of a child, which is to say that it casts a familiar and much examined world into a twilight of the uncanny—the known revisited as the hazily uncharted in the act of exploration. The Boy is about as un-Hollywood in its exploration of childhood and fascism as Pan's Labyrinth—and similarly gruesome. In its final scenes, in which terrified parents run through the woods in search of their son, it resembles the horror of a Grimm's tale before Disney got his fingers on it. The Boy is uncompromisingly bleak. The title character, as you might have guessed, is a Jewish child in a Nazi concentration camp. As I was reminded on a recent visit to Riga, Latvia, the camp uniform does indeed resemble old-fashioned sleep ware, a comparison all the more poignant if we consider that the camps were the final resting place for most of its inmates. The central character, though, is the son of a Nazi officer. Eight years old, he is unaware of what is going on beyond the walls of his austere new home, the one to which his family moved from Berlin after his father was assigned with the supervision of the nearby concentration camp. To the boy in his cheerless isolation, the camp is farm, a lively community where he might make new friends. Day after day, he ventures through the woods to the electric fence behind which he descries a boy is own age, a fellow whose life seems mysterious and exciting to him. Why should he accept that his new playmate is separated from him? Why not ignore or overcome this barrier? Why not wear 'striped pyjamas' to be just like his new friend? We have the answers to those questions; history provided them, and everyday life often confirms them. We know what happened. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The Boy in the Striped Pajamas stands out because of its point of view. The point of view is of a nine-year-old German boy named Bruno. Bruno's family is very wealthy, and he gets whatever he wants. Bruno's dad is a commander of the Nazis, and Bruno's sister, Gretel, is obsessed with dolls and politics. We don't hear about his mother much through the story; she is, as some would call her, a flat character. Bruno's life gets turned upside down when he comes home one day to see all of his clothes in a suitcase and all of his room decor ripped off the wall and packed away. His maid, Maria, tells him that the whole family will be leaving to go to camp. We later learn that his father has been promoted to Commandant of Auschwitz. Bruno, being the naive little tot that he is, thought it was a family summer camp. When he reaches the camp, he gets the biggest shock of his lifetime. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Directed by Mark Herman and based on the historical Holocaust novel written by John Boyne, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas is set during World War II and is told from the perspective of eight-year-old Bruno (Asa Butterfield), the son of a high-ranking Nazi commandant, whose family is forced to move to Auschwitz when Bruno's father (David Thewlis) is promoted. Away from his friends and growing increasingly bored, Bruno ventures outside of his backyard, defying his mother's (Vera Farmiga) rules, in search of something to do. Here, Bruno meets Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a young Jewish boy who, unbeknownst to Bruno, is an inmate in a concentration camp, which Bruno believes to be a farm. Their friendship grows with Bruno's frequent visits, but their innocent secret quickly sets into motion a tragic and devastating sequence of events.

I found myself on the edge of my seat at times, yelling at my screen, and even crying. This film is nearly a masterpiece in my eyes. Bruno, a young naive boy, son to his Nazi father, Ralf, befriended a young Jewish boy in his father's concentration camp named Shmuel. Through out the movie, the two young boys grow close. Bruno sneaks off to the camp to see his new friend, Shmuel, without his parents knowing, which evidently led to his death. Bruno and Shmuel both sadly died in the gas chamber, holding hands, not knowing what was going on. Before the two died, Bruno told Shmuel that they were only in the gas chamber to take a shower. This ending was unexpected. As I had believed that this would end with the two growing up together, it sadly took a more saddening route. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> I can only imagine the Auschwitz Museum is gearing up for their next public denouncement, with the news that the author is coming out with a sequel to the book later this year. To summarize the plot of 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' for you, 9-year-old Bruno, the son of a Nazi Commandant at Auschwitz, befriends a Jewish boy named Shmuel through the fence of the camp. Bruno has no knowledge of the Holocaust (his mother and sister are also unaware of the extent of the atrocities) and thinks Shmuel's uniform is a pair of pajamas. After Shmuel's father goes 'missing,' Bruno sneaks into the camp to help find him, but the two boys are herded into a gas chamber and killed. Wracked with guilt, Bruno's father allows himself to be taken prisoner by the allies when they liberate the camp. </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> The Boy in the Striped Pajamas tells the story of Bruno, a young German boy growing up during World War II. As a nine-year-old, Bruno lived in his own world of imagination. He enjoyed reading adventure stories and going on expeditions to explore the lesser-known corners of his family's massive house in Berlin. Although his father served as an officer in Germany's Nazi Party, Bruno understood little about his work. Nor did he understand anything about the war. Bruno's main concerns in life were to follow the strict rules set forth by his parents and to steer clear of his older sister, Gretel. Otherwise, he enjoyed seeing the hustle and bustle of Berlin and spending time with his three best friends: Karl, Daniel, and Martin. </p>",2025-11-19 19:36:36-08:00,False,Response is valid.

To the boy in his cheerless isolation, the camp is farm, a lively community where he might make new friends.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> I now have a new addition to my list of disliked Holocaust movies: The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.  The movie centers on a young German boy whose father is the commandante of a Nazi extermination camp.  The father is evil, a Nazi ideologue; his wife is horrified by what she knows is going on; the daughter joins the Hitler youth; and the boy, our protagonist, is too young to understand what is really going on inside the camp.  One day the boy sneaks out of his house and comes across a young Jewish boy sitting on the other side of the camp's electrified barbed-wire fence.  They talk for a while, then agree to keep meeting at the fence.  Slowly, over the course of a number of weeks, they become good friends.  The Jewish boy continually hints at the treatment to which he and his family are being subjected, but never explicitly discusses the killings that regularly take place in the camp. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is – or was for me – an incredibly moving and powerfully affecting film. It manages to make you feel how utterly evil Evil is. It also makes you feel how important and valuable every single human life is, and how tragic and terrible is its loss. The story centres on a German family – father, mother, young teenage daughter and most of all their 8-year-old son Bruno – during the Second World War. Bruno's father is a soldier, and at the start of the film he has just been promoted, meaning that the whole family must move to a new house in the country. Only gradually does it become clear that the father's new position is Commandant of an extermination camp – fairly obviously Auschwitz, though this is never spelt out. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas shows how terribly easy it is for humans to dehumanise and brutalise other humans, even to the extent of viewing and treating them as sub-human vermin to be controlled and exterminated (the ruling Hutus referred to the Tutsis as 'cockroaches' in the Rwandan genocide). And in the process how those doing the brutalising paradoxically become brutalised and dehumanised themselves. Humanity and the value of human life Conversely, the film shows up the potential goodness of humanity and the human spirit in stark contrast to the inhumanity and brutality to which other humans are subjecting it. It shows that, while the brutalisers become increasingly brutish, those who are being treated brutally can choose to retain their humanity and dignity in the face of everything. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The Boy with the Striped Pyjamas is largely told from the perspective of a child, which is to say that it casts a familiar and much examined world into a twilight of the uncanny—the known revisited as the hazily uncharted in the act of exploration. The Boy is about as un-Hollywood in its exploration of childhood and fascism as Pan's Labyrinth—and similarly gruesome. In its final scenes, in which terrified parents run through the woods in search of their son, it resembles the horror of a Grimm's tale before Disney got his fingers on it. The Boy is uncompromisingly bleak. The title character, as you might have guessed, is a Jewish child in a Nazi concentration camp. As I was reminded on a recent visit to Riga, Latvia, the camp uniform does indeed resemble old-fashioned sleep ware, a comparison all the more poignant if we consider that the camps were the final resting place for most of its inmates. The central character, though, is the son of a Nazi officer. Eight years old, he is unaware of what is going on beyond the walls of his austere new home, the one to which his family moved from Berlin after his father was assigned with the supervision of the nearby concentration camp. To the boy in his cheerless isolation, the camp is farm, a lively community where he might make new friends. Day after day, he ventures through the woods to the electric fence behind which he descries a boy is own age, a fellow whose life seems mysterious and exciting to him. Why should he accept that his new playmate is separated from him? Why not ignore or overcome this barrier? Why not wear 'striped pyjamas' to be just like his new friend? We have the answers to those questions; history provided them, and everyday life often confirms them. We know what happened. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The Boy in the Striped Pajamas stands out because of its point of view. The point of view is of a nine-year-old German boy named Bruno. Bruno's family is very wealthy, and he gets whatever he wants. Bruno's dad is a commander of the Nazis, and Bruno's sister, Gretel, is obsessed with dolls and politics. We don't hear about his mother much through the story; she is, as some would call her, a flat character. Bruno's life gets turned upside down when he comes home one day to see all of his clothes in a suitcase and all of his room decor ripped off the wall and packed away. His maid, Maria, tells him that the whole family will be leaving to go to camp. We later learn that his father has been promoted to Commandant of Auschwitz.

'Be Thankful' has, in my view, one of the sickest laid-back grooves of all time. It begins with congas before the organ and fat bass line slide in. Norman Harris's funky guitar riffs sound like they could be in a Blaxploitation flick of the era. There are only two chord progressions in the song, which helps to accentuate the lyrics and chorus.

William DeVaughn wrote the song while he was working for the government as a draftsman. He spent $900 of his own money to record it. The song got the attention of the studio's owner, who shopped the recording around, and ultimately secured a contract for a proper release in 1974. The single sold over 2 million copies.

Valentine & Moores 1970 were probably the first to recognise a Precambrian supercontinent, which they named 'Pangaea I.' It was renamed 'Rodinia' by McMenamin & McMenamin 1990 who also were the first to produce a reconstruction and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent. Rodinia formed at c. 1.23 Ga by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent, Columbia, assembled by global-scale 2.0–1.8 Ga collisional events. Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic with its continental fragments reassembled to form Pannotia 633–573 Ma. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known about the configuration and geodynamic history of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the Earth's crust but not to their longitude, which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed. The extreme cooling of the global climate around 717–635 Ma (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes. Geodynamics Paleogeographic reconstructions Rodinia at 900 Ma. 'Consensus' reconstruction of Li et al. 2008. The idea that a supercontinent existed in the early Neoproterozoic arose in the 1970s, when geologists determined that orogens of this age exist on virtually all cratons.[failed verification] Examples are the Grenville orogeny in North America and the Dalslandian orogeny in Europe. Since then, many alternative reconstructions have been proposed for the configuration of the cratons in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different cratons. Though the configuration of the core cratons in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data. Life timelineThis box: Most reconstructions show Rodinia's core formed by the North American Craton (the later paleocontinent of Laurentia), surrounded in the southeast with the East European Craton (the later paleocontinent of Baltica), the Amazonian Craton and the West African Craton; in the south with the Río de la Plata and São Francisco cratons; in the southwest with the Congo and Kalahari cratons; and in the northeast with Australia, India and eastern Antarctica. The positions of Siberia and North and South China north of the North American craton differ strongly depending on the reconstruction: SWEAT-Configuration (Southwest US-East Antarctica craton): Antarctica is southwest of Laurentia, and Australia is north of Antarctica. AUSWUS-Configuration (Australia-western US): Australia is west of Laurentia. AUSMEX-Configuration (Australia-Mexico): Australia is at the location of current day Mexico relative to Laurentia. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> According to J.D.A. Piper, Rodinia is one of two models for the configuration and history of the continental crust in the latter part of Precambrian times. The other is Paleopangea, Piper's own concept. Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the late Proterozoic and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent 'Paleopangaea' supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 Ma and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 Ma. This latter solution predicts that break-up was confined to the Ediacaran period and produced the dramatic environmental changes that characterised the transition between the Precambrian and Phanerozoic. However, this theory has been widely criticized, as incorrect applications of paleomagnetic data have been pointed out. Breakup In 2009 UNESCO's International Geoscience Programme project 440, named 'Rodinia Assembly and Breakup,' concluded that Rodinia broke up in four stages between 825 and 550 Ma: The breakup was initiated by a superplume around 825–800 Ma whose influence—such as crustal arching, intense bimodal magmatism, and accumulation of thick rift-type sedimentary successions—has been recorded in South Australia, South China, Tarim, Kalahari, India, and the Arabian-Nubian Craton. Rifting progressed in the same cratons 800–750 Ma and spread into Laurentia and perhaps Siberia. India (including Madagascar) and the Congo–São Francisco Craton were either detached from Rodinia during this period or simply never were part of the supercontinent. As the central part of Rodinia reached the Equator around 750–700 Ma, a new pulse of magmatism and rifting continued the disassembly in western Kalahari, West Australia, South China, Tarim, and most margins of Laurentia. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Rodinia, a Russian term for 'motherland,' was the next older supercontinent; it came together about 1 billion years ago and rifted apart about 750 million years ago.

Alfred Wegener proposed the existence of Pangaea in the early 20th century based on evidence from geology, paleontology, and continental drift. Supercontinents like Gondwana and Laurasia combined with the Siberia landmass, resulting in Pangaea. A single large ocean called Panthalassa surrounded Pangaea. The formation of Pangaea had significant impacts on Earth's climate and biota: It created vast deserts in the center of the continent due to its distance from the ocean, while coastal areas experienced humid climates. The breakup of Pangaea began around 200 million years ago, leading to the formation of the separate continents currently on Earth.

Geologists proposed the concept of Pannotia in the early 1990s based on geological and paleomagnetic evidence. Pannotia was at the South Pole, and a global ocean, which had surrounded the earlier Rodinia, enclosed the landmass, which is how it first formed. The supercontinent consisted of present-day South America, Arabia, Antarctica, Australia, and parts of Asia. The breakup of Pannotia contributed to the formation of new oceans, such as the Iapetus Ocean and the Proto-Tethys Ocean.

The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund is also formed, insuring share deposits at federally insured credit unions up to $20,000. Until this point, credit unions had operated without federal deposit insurance. Lieutenant General Herman Nickerson, Jr., becomes the first Administrator of the National Credit Union Administration. 1971 With the signing of Executive Order 11580 on January 20, President Richard Nixon establishes the original NCUA seal design. This design was the official seal of the agency until 2017. 1974 Legislation increases insurance coverage on credit union member share deposits to $40,000. 1976 C. Austin Montgomery is appointed NCUA Administrator. 1978 Lawrence Connell is appointed NCUA Administrator. 1979 A three-member Board replaces the NCUA Administrator as the governing body for the agency after Congress updates the Federal Credit Union Act. Board members are nominated and appointed by the President of the United States, and must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Board terms are set for staggered six-year terms, and not more than two members of the Board shall be members of the same political party. In appointing the Board, the president must designate the Chairman. The first NCUA Board consists of former NCUA Administrator and newly appointed Chairman Lawrence Connell (1979–1981), Dr. Harold A. Black (1979–1981), and Vice Chairman P.A. Mack, Jr (1979–1987). Congress also creates the Central Liquidity Facility. This facility is similar the Federal Reserve's Discount Window and serves a similar function as the lender of last resort for the credit union system. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The Asset Liquidation and Management Center in Austin, Texas, is created to deal with problem assets the NCUA acquires from both operating and liquidating credit unions. Over the years, the office's role expands to include providing consulting services to the NCUA regional offices on such topics as lending analysis, records reconstruction, and fraud investigation. Renamed the Asset Management and Assistance Center in 1996, it also provides training to both NCUA and state credit union examiners. 1990 By the end of 1990, the credit union system has 12,891 federally insured credit unions, $223 billion in assets and 61 million members. Robert Swan is appointed as an NCUA Board Member. He serves until 1996. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The financial crisis that will eventually devastate the nation's economy and threaten the existence of the credit union system becomes evident. Banks, retirement plans, and investment firms that invested heavily in securities that included subprime mortgages see mounting losses as foreclosures begin to rise and the value of those assets declines. The nation officially enters the recession in December. By official reckoning, the recession — the most severe since the 1930s — runs until June 2009, though the effects would last several years longer. More than 8 million Americans lose their jobs. The net worth of U.S. households and non-profit organizations falls by $15 trillion. 2008 July 29, 2008 – Michael E. Fryzel is sworn in as NCUA Board Chairman.

The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was enacted by Congress in June 1933 and was one of the measures by which President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to assist the nation's economic recovery during the Great Depression. The passage of NIRA ushered in a unique experiment in U.S. economic history – the NIRA sanctioned, supported, and in some cases, enforced an alliance of industries. Antitrust laws were suspended, and companies were required to write industry-wide 'codes of fair competition' that effectively fixed prices and wages, established production quotas, and imposed restrictions on entry of other companies into the alliances. The act further called for industrial self-regulation and declared that codes of fair competition – for the protection of consumers, competitors, and employers – were to be drafted for the various industries of the country and were to be subject to public hearings. Employees were given the right to organize and bargain collectively and could not be required, as a condition of employment, to join or refrain from joining a labor organization. The National Recovery Administration (NRA), created by a separate executive order, was put into operation soon after the final approval of the act. President Roosevelt appointed Hugh S. Johnson as administrator for industrial recovery. The administration was empowered to make voluntary agreements dealing with hours of work, rates of pay, and the fixing of prices. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> By the time Perkins came to the Department of Labor in 1933 the economy had virtually collapsed. An estimated 13 million people were unemployed and hundreds of thousands had become homeless wanderers in search of work. The nation's industrial production had fallen by 44 percent since 1929. Millions of farmers faced foreclosure. Banks were failing by the score. Local governments were running out of money for relief programs. President Roosevelt's approach to the problem was both conservative and innovative. He spurned both the economic orthodoxy of the Hoover Administration and the wishes of many to see drastic, dictatorial action. He surrounded himself with able, creative minds and set out on a flexible and humane program to get the country back on its feet. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The renewed interest in organizing, together with the refusal of many employers to recognize the unions their employees wanted, triggered strikes in support of the organizing drives. By August 1933, the situation had become so severe that President Franklin Roosevelt created a National Labor Board (NLB) to bring about compliance with Section 7(a) and to mediate labor disputes. He made Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York its chairman. Three industry representatives were selected for the NLB by the National Recovery Administration's Industry Advisory Board, and three labor members were picked by the NRA's Labor Advisory Board. In early 1934, President Roosevelt authorized the NLB to conduct union representation elections and handle violations of the NIRA codes. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> to director of the agency in 2019.

The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office. By specifying the extent of the 'judicial Power,' the Constitution authorized the creation of federal courts with limited subject matter jurisdiction. Article III identifies several categories of cases over which the Supreme Court possesses original jurisdiction.1 FootnoteU.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. In addition, the Constitution generally authorizes federal courts to hear Within those broad categories, Congress has traditionally been understood to exercise significant discretion to decide which cases particular federal courts have jurisdiction to hear. The Constitution sets the maximum possible extent of federal court jurisdiction. Congress cannot expand such jurisdiction beyond the applicable constitutional limits, but is free to grant the federal courts authority over only a subset of constitutionally permissible cases. In practice, Congress has always granted the federal courts less expansive jurisdiction than the Constitution authorizes.3 FootnoteSee, e.g., Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.

Personal jurisdiction is the requirement that a given court have power over the defendant, based on minimum contacts with the forum. Subject-matter jurisdiction is the requirement that a given court have power to hear the specific kind of claim that is brought to that court. While litigating parties may waive personal jurisdiction, they cannot waive subject-matter jurisdiction. In federal court, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is considered a favored defense and may be raised at any point in the litigation process, even if the parties had previously argued that subject-matter jurisdiction existed. In fact, the court may dismiss a case sua sponte (on its own) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1). General and Limited Jurisdiction </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The two primary sources of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts are diversity jurisdiction and federal question jurisdiction. Diversity jurisdiction generally permits individuals to bring claims in federal court where the claim exceeds $75,000 and the parties are citizens of different states. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. So, if a citizen of New York sues a citizen of California for more than $75,000, a federal court would have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear that claim. Under federal question jurisdiction, a litigant—regardless of the value of the claim—may bring a claim in federal court if it arises under federal law, including the U.S. Constitution. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Federal question jurisdiction requires that the federal element appears on the face of a well-plead complaint, is a substantial component of the complainant's claim, and is of significant federal interest. Federal question subject-matter jurisdiction is frequently derived from federal statutes granting a cause of action to parties who have suffered a particular injury. Furthermore, it is important to note that 28 U.S.C. § 1367 provides for supplemental jurisdiction in federal courts. Supplemental jurisdiction allows a federal court to adjudicate a claim over which it does not have independent subject-matter jurisdiction, on the basis that the claim is related to a claim over which the federal court does have independent jurisdiction. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Because the question of whether a tribal court can exercise civil jurisdiction is a question of federal law,(5) and the Supreme Court has recognized that Congress has plenary authority(6) over Indian affairs, Congress has enacted legislation which vests tribal courts with jurisdiction in certain cases, and deprives them of jurisdiction in others. Examples of delegated tribal court civil jurisdiction include: 1) exclusive jurisdiction to foreclose mortgages held by a private lender on Indian trust land, see 25 U.S.C. 483A; 2) exclusive jurisdiction over child custody proceedings involving Indian children residing in Indian country and concurrent jurisdiction over those proceedings when the child resides off under the Indian Child Welfare Act, see 25 U.S.C.1911; 3) concurrent jurisdiction, with state governments, to regulate liquor distribution within Indian country and resulting tribal court authority to enforce regulations, see City of Timber Lake v.

Genesis 2:24 NKJV Matthew 19:5 Mark 10:7 Ephesians 5:31 – This has two meanings for me. The first is that while a mother's relationship with their child is unique & special, it comes after the relationship designed by God between a husband & wife. And second, based off of this first understanding, is of the importance of raising a child to understand the importance of relationships, theirs with their parents & with their future spouse. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> 'A son honours his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, where is the honour due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?' says the LORD Almighty. 'It is you, O priests, who show contempt for my name. But you ask, 'How have we shown contempt for your name?''— Malachi 1:6 (NIV) Judaism What constitutes 'honour?' One must provide them with food and drink and clothing. One should bring them home and take them out, and provide them with all their needs cheerfully. — Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:7 The commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honouring God, for one owes their existence to their father and their mother. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Our Rabbis taught: It says, 'Honour your father and your mother' (Exodus 20:12), and it says, 'Honor God with your wealth' (Proverbs 3:9). By using the same terminology, the Torah compares the honour you owe your father and mother to the honour you have to give to the Almighty. It also says, 'Every person must respect his mother and his father' (Leviticus 19:3), and it says, 'God your Lord you shall respect, Him you shall serve' (Deuteronomy 10:20). Here the same word, respect, is used. The Torah equates the respect you owe your parents with the respect you must show God. Furthermore, it says, 'Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death (Exodus 21:17). And furthermore, it says, 'Anyone that curses God shall bear his sin' (Leviticus 24.–15). By using the same terms the Torah compares cursing of parents with cursing the Almighty. — Talmud Kiddushin 31 Because honouring parents is part of honouring God, the mitzvah does not depend on the worthiness of the parent: 'Even if his father is wicked and a sinner, he must fear and revere him ... A convert to Judaism must not curse or despise his non-Jewish father.' (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:13,25) It also requires honour to one's stepparents or an older sibling who is raising one, and one's teachers, though one has a greater obligation to honor a parent than a grandparent. The commandment is repeated eight times throughout the bible. Historical beliefs Keeping this commandment was associated by the Israelites with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them. According to the Torah, striking or cursing one's father or mother was punishable by immediate death. In Deuteronomy, a procedure is described for parents to bring a persistently disobedient son to the city elders for death by stoning. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Many of us still love our abusers, but because it is not safe to be with them, we have learned to love them from a distance. The same is true of honoring. If your parents refuse to respect your boundaries and choose to continue mistreating you, then you can limit or end, if necessary, your time with them, 'honor' them from a safe distance, and still be obedient to God's Word. You can speak the truth about your parents at all times and not be dishonoring them. Only people who want carte blanche to get away with anything would accuse you of not honoring them simply because you spoke the truth and set healthy boundaries in your relationship. 'These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts; do not plot evil against your neighbor, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,' declares the Lord….Zechariah 8: 16-17 NIV Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth….1 Corinthians 13: 6 NIV </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> God placed no conditions on the command to honor. 'Honor those who are honorable.' It's not there. We are not responsible for our parents' actions, but we are responsible for our own—and the command is for us to honor them.  Even if your parents are deceased, you are still commanded to honor them. How seriously does God take this? 'If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death.

For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river as a major transportation and trading route. In the five centuries before European colonization, the Mississippian culture built numerous regional chiefdoms and major earthwork mounds in the Ohio Valley like the Angel Mounds near Evansville, Indiana as well as in the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. The historic Osage, Omaha, Ponca, and Kaw peoples lived in the Ohio Valley.

The Indians and early European explorers and settlers of the region often considered the Allegheny to be part of the Ohio. The forks (the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Pittsburgh) were considered a strategic military location by colonial French and British, and later independent American military authorities. The confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers is at Cairo, Illinois. The river follows a roughly southwest and then west-northwest course until Cincinnati, before bending to a west-southwest course for most of the remainder of its length. The course forms the northern borders of West Virginia and Kentucky; and the southern borders of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, until it joins the Mississippi River at the city of Cairo, Illinois. Where the Ohio joins the Mississippi is the lowest elevation in the state of Illinois, at 315 feet (96 m). Natural-color satellite image of the Wabash-Ohio confluence The Mississippi River flows to the Gulf of Mexico on the Atlantic Ocean. Among rivers wholly or mostly in the United States, the Ohio is the second largest by discharge volume and the tenth longest and has the eighth largest drainage basin. It serves to separate the Midwestern Great Lakes states from the Upper South states, which were historically border states in the Civil War. The Ohio River is a left (east) and the largest tributary by volume of the Mississippi River in the United States. At the confluence, the Ohio is considerably bigger than the Mississippi, measured by long-term mean discharge. The Ohio River at Cairo is 281,500 cu ft/s (7,960 m3/s); and the Mississippi River at Thebes, Illinois, which is upstream of the confluence, is 208,200 cu ft/s (5,897 m3/s). The Ohio River flow is greater than that of the Mississippi River, so hydrologically the Ohio River is the main stream of the river system. River depth Lawrenceburg, Indiana, is one of many towns that use the Ohio as a shipping avenue. The Ohio River is a naturally shallow river that was artificially deepened by a series of dams. The natural depth of the river varied from about 3 to 20 feet (1 to 6 m). The dams raise the water level and have turned the river largely into a series of reservoirs, eliminating shallow stretches and allowing for commercial navigation. From its origin to Cincinnati, the average depth is approximately 15 feet (5 m). The largest immediate drop in water level is below the McAlpine Locks and Dam at the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, Kentucky, where flood stage is reached when the water reaches 23 feet (7 m) on the lower gauge. However, the river's deepest point is 168 feet (51 m) on the western side of Louisville, Kentucky.

The historic Osage, Omaha, Ponca, and Kaw peoples lived in the Ohio Valley.

Explain to a third-grader: where does the ohio river and the mississippi river meet,ETA3G,"""The Ohio River becomes a tributary of the Mississippi River directly south of Cairo, Illinois"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Ohio River becomes a tributary of the Mississippi River directly south of Cairo, Illinois, a small city on the spit of land where the rivers converge (at center of this astronaut photograph). Brown, sediment-laden water flowing generally northeast to south from the Ohio River is distinct from the green and relatively sediment-poor water of the Mississippi River (flowing northwest to south). The color of the rivers in this image is reversed from the usual condition of a green Ohio and a brown Mississippi. This suggests that the very high rainfall in December 2005 over the Appalachians and the northeastern United States has led to greater-than-normal amounts of sediment in the rivers and streams of the Ohio River watershed. The distinct boundary between the two river's waters indicates that little to no mixing occurs even 5-6 kilometers (3-4 miles) downstream. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The Ohio River is a 981-mile-long (1,579 km) river in the United States. It is located at the boundary of the Midwestern and Southern United States, flowing in a southwesterly direction from western Pennsylvania to its mouth on the Mississippi River at the southern tip of Illinois. It is the third largest river by discharge volume in the United States and the largest tributary by volume of the north-south flowing Mississippi River, which divides the eastern from western United States. It is also the 6th oldest river on the North American continent. The river flows through or along the border of six states, and its drainage basin includes parts of 14 states. Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River, the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S. It is the source of drinking water for five million people. The river became a primary transportation route for pioneers during the westward expansion of the early U.S. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The name 'Ohio' comes from the Seneca, Ohi:yo', lit. 'Good River'.

Once the hook is threaded, I attach the snell (loop end) of the hook to the main line with a snap swivel.

About 95% of the total body fluoride is found in bones and teeth (1). Although its role in the prevention of dental caries (tooth decay) is well established, fluoride is not generally considered an essential mineral element because humans do not require it for growth or to sustain life (2). However, if one considers the prevention of chronic disease (dental caries) an important criterion in determining essentiality, then fluoride might well be considered an essential trace element (3). Function Fluoride is absorbed in the stomach and </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Research has indicated that the primary action of fluoride occurs topically after the teeth erupt into the mouth. Ingested fluoride is secreted in the saliva and contributes to topical protection. When enamel is partially demineralized by organic acids, fluoride in the saliva can enhance the remineralization of enamel through its interactions with calcium and phosphate. Fluoride containing remineralized enamel is more resistant to acid attack and demineralization. In salivary concentrations associated with optimum fluoride intake, fluoride has been found to inhibit bacterial enzymes, resulting in reduced acid production by cariogenic bacteria (7, 17). </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Dental fluorosis Dental fluorosis, also called enamel fluorosis, is a result of excess fluoride intake during the period of tooth formation, with the critical window of susceptibility being the first eight years of life, as this corresponds to the eruption of the permanent teeth (86). Once the tooth enamel has formed, dental fluorosis cannot develop (87). The mildest form of dental fluorosis is detectable only to the trained observer and is characterized by small opaque white flecks or spots on the enamel of the teeth. Moderate dental fluorosis is characterized by mottling and mild staining of the teeth, and severe dental fluorosis results in marked staining and pitting of the teeth. In its moderate to severe forms, dental fluorosis becomes a cosmetic concern when it affects the incisors and canines (front teeth). Dental fluorosis is a dose-dependent condition, with higher fluoride intakes being associated with more pronounced effects on the teeth. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Most toothpaste sold in the United States contains fluoride in the form of sodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate, most commonly at a level of 1,000 to 1,100 mg/L (about 1.3 mg in a quarter teaspoon, a typical amount of toothpaste used for one brushing) [3]. The amount of fluoride ingested from toothpaste depends on the amount used, the person's swallowing control, and how often the person uses toothpaste. Estimated typical amounts of fluoride ingested daily from toothpaste are 0.1 mg to 0.25 mg for infants and children age 0 to 5 years, 0.2 to 0.3 mg for children age 6 to 12 years, and 0.1 mg for adults [3]. Fluoride in toothpaste, regardless of its form, is well absorbed [1]. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Fluoride enters the body through water, food or oral hygiene products such as toothpastes, mouthwashes or dental treatments. In some countries in Europe and South America, fluoride may also be found in table salt. Once absorbed in the digestive tract, some fluoride gets stored in the bones and teeth, where it stimulates new bone growth and strengthens teeth. Over time, that strength helps fight tooth decay that occurs during eating. While fluoride has proven benefits for dental health, there is such a thing as too much fluoride—particularly for children. One common problem associated with too much fluoride is fluorosis, a condition that causes a range of changes to the appearance of tooth enamel, from little white spots to brown stains or even a rough, sanded-away appearance on the tooth surface. Fluorosis results from excessive fluoride exposure as a child (while adult teeth are still forming), usually through a combination of fluoride sources such as toothpaste and drinking water. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> in the mouth, is also retained and concentrated in plaque. Fluoride works to control early dental caries in several ways. Fluoride concentrated in plaque and saliva inhibits the demineralization of sound enamel and enhances the remineralization (i.e., recovery) of demineralized enamel (12,13). As cariogenic bacteria metabolize carbohydrates and produce acid, fluoride is released from dental plaque in response to lowered pH at the tooth-plaque interface (14). The released fluoride and the fluoride present in saliva are then taken up, along with calcium and phosphate, by de-mineralized enamel to establish an improved enamel crystal structure. This improved structure is more acid resistant and contains more fluoride and less carbonate (12,15--19) (Figure 1).

About 95% of the total body fluoride is found in bones and teeth (1). Although its role in the prevention of dental caries (tooth decay) is well established, fluoride is not generally considered an essential mineral element because humans do not require it for growth or to sustain life (2). However, if one considers the prevention of chronic disease (dental caries) an important criterion in determining essentiality, then fluoride might well be considered an essential trace element (3). Function Fluoride is absorbed in the stomach and </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Research has indicated that the primary action of fluoride occurs topically after the teeth erupt into the mouth. Ingested fluoride is secreted in the saliva and contributes to topical protection. When enamel is partially demineralized by organic acids, fluoride in the saliva can enhance the remineralization of enamel through its interactions with calcium and phosphate. Fluoride containing remineralized enamel is more resistant to acid attack and demineralization. In salivary concentrations associated with optimum fluoride intake, fluoride has been found to inhibit bacterial enzymes, resulting in reduced acid production by cariogenic bacteria (7, 17). </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Dental fluorosis Dental fluorosis, also called enamel fluorosis, is a result of excess fluoride intake during the period of tooth formation, with the critical window of susceptibility being the first eight years of life, as this corresponds to the eruption of the permanent teeth (86). Once the tooth enamel has formed, dental fluorosis cannot develop (87). The mildest form of dental fluorosis is detectable only to the trained observer and is characterized by small opaque white flecks or spots on the enamel of the teeth. Moderate dental fluorosis is characterized by mottling and mild staining of the teeth, and severe dental fluorosis results in marked staining and pitting of the teeth. In its moderate to severe forms, dental fluorosis becomes a cosmetic concern when it affects the incisors and canines (front teeth). Dental fluorosis is a dose-dependent condition, with higher fluoride intakes being associated with more pronounced effects on the teeth. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Most toothpaste sold in the United States contains fluoride in the form of sodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate, most commonly at a level of 1,000 to 1,100 mg/L (about 1.3 mg in a quarter teaspoon, a typical amount of toothpaste used for one brushing) [3]. The amount of fluoride ingested from toothpaste depends on the amount used, the person's swallowing control, and how often the person uses toothpaste. Estimated typical amounts of fluoride ingested daily from toothpaste are 0.1 mg to 0.25 mg for infants and children age 0 to 5 years, 0.2 to 0.3 mg for children age 6 to 12 years, and 0.1 mg for adults [3]. Fluoride in toothpaste, regardless of its form, is well absorbed [1]. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Fluoride enters the body through water, food or oral hygiene products such as toothpastes, mouthwashes or dental treatments. In some countries in Europe and South America, fluoride may also be found in table salt. Once absorbed in the digestive tract, some fluoride gets stored in the bones and teeth, where it stimulates new bone growth and strengthens teeth. Over time, that strength helps fight tooth decay that occurs during eating. While fluoride has proven benefits for dental health, there is such a thing as too much fluoride—particularly for children. One common problem associated with too much fluoride is fluorosis, a condition that causes a range of changes to the appearance of tooth enamel, from little white spots to brown stains or even a rough, sanded-away appearance on the tooth surface. Fluorosis results from excessive fluoride exposure as a child (while adult teeth are still forming), usually through a combination of fluoride sources such as toothpaste and drinking water. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> in the mouth, is also retained and concentrated in plaque. Fluoride works to control early dental caries in several ways. Fluoride concentrated in plaque and saliva inhibits the demineralization of sound enamel and enhances the remineralization (i.e., recovery) of demineralized enamel (12,13). As cariogenic bacteria metabolize carbohydrates and produce acid, fluoride is released from dental plaque in response to lowered pH at the tooth-plaque interface (14). The released fluoride and the fluoride present in saliva are then taken up, along with calcium and phosphate, by de-mineralized enamel to establish an improved enamel crystal structure. This improved structure is more acid resistant and contains more fluoride and less carbonate (12,15--19) (Figure 1).

Based on the best-selling book series by L.J. Smith, The Vampire Diaries was developed for the small screen by Dawson's Creek creator Kevin Williamson with his long-time collaborator Julie Plec and premiered on The CW in 2009. Set in the picturesque, but paranormal town of Mystic Falls, the long-running series focused on the vampire love triangle between protagonists Elena (Nina Dobrev), Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) and his brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder), alongside the town's other human and not-so-human inhabitants. The Vampire Diaries spawned not one, but two spinoffs – The Originals and Legacies – and developed a loyal fan following over its eight seasons on the air. The show enjoyed a good run and its season 8 finale wrapped up most of its unresolved storylines nicely in an epic episode that featured some major character deaths and a few happy endings. Related: Preacher Finally Reveals How Cassidy Became A Vampire Despite its satisfying finale fans of the show still hope another season might be on the cards, but could The Vampire Diaries season 9 ever happen? The CW Canceled The Vampire Diaries In 2017 Just a few months after The CW renewed the show for its eighth season, showrunner Julie Plec announced The Vampire Diaries would end with season 8, feeling the show had come to a natural end. Fans may have been disappointed then, but the knowledge that season 8 would be the show's last allowed its makers to craft a final season that tied up loose ends and bid a proper farewell to its characters. The Vampire Diaries Season 9 Isn't Likely Star Ian Somerhalder has stated several times he feels The Vampire Diaries chapter of his career is closed and seeing as Nina Dobrev left the show in season 6 and only returned for the finale, it doesn't seem likely she'd be interested in filming a ninth season. More recently, Somerhalder appeared on Andy Cohen Live and seemed to lay the rumors to rest regarding his and Dobrev's return for a season 9. In his words: 'I have not heard anything about a season nine…I mean, like, what would happen? Stefan and Damon…Damon has, like, gray hair and…they have canes?... Listen, it ran a great course and now it's still living. That's what's so amazing. It's still living.' </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Based on the book series by L. J. Smith, the fan-favorite series aired from 2009 to 2017 and starred Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley, Candice King, Steven R. McQueen, Ian Somerhalder, Kat Graham, Zach Roerig, Michael Trevino and Matthew Davis. Throughout its reign on The CW, The Vampire Diaries' success spawned two spinoff series, The Originals and Legacies. While the original stars have since moved on from their time in the fictional supernatural town, is there any chance for some of them to return? In June 2021, following a viral photo of Nina and Kat's sweet reunion shared via Instagram, the 17 Again alum shared her thoughts on fans' hope for a reboot. 'I don't think Nina and I are interested in that, but I think our friendship will be forever,' Kat told TMZ. 'Seasons end but some friendships will be forever.

Character overview Stone works in the Manhattan District Attorney's office under Alfred Wentworth (Roy Thinnes, in the pilot episode 'Everybody's Favorite Bagman') and Adam Schiff (Steven Hill). He was born in 1943 and raised in an Irish Catholic family. He was raised mostly by his Irish grandmother, his father having been an alcoholic. Stone is divorced and has a son, Peter Stone (Philip Winchester), who was the Deputy Chief of the Special Prosecutions Bureau in Chicago and was the Chief ADA of the Sex Crimes Bureau in New York, and a daughter, Pamela (Amy Korb). Stone's prosecutorial methods are portrayed as being grounded in moral principles stemming from his Catholic faith. He is shown to be anti-abortion and opposed to the death penalty. He also is a strong advocate of social justice, having marched in the civil rights movement. It is implied that Stone, like actor Moriarty, is a Dartmouth College alumnus, with references to 'fraternity row' and New Hampshire. Stone is also likely a graduate of New York University Law School, evidenced by the diplomas on his wall in several episodes. Career within the show Stone became Executive Assistant DA in 1985 after convicting con artist and murderer Philip Swann (Željko Ivanek), who years later enters a civil suit against Stone when the validity of the conviction is called into question. Swann is ultimately found guilty, however, and sent back to prison. Stone's assistants have been Paul Robinette (Richard Brooks) and Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennessy). Stone makes his last appearance in the show in the episode 'Old Friends,' the final episode of season four. The episode portrays a racketeering case in which the main witness, Ann Madsen (Allison Janney), whose testimony Stone had secured by threatening to send her to prison, is murdered by the Russian Mafia.

He received an Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for his role as a Nazi SS officer in the 1978 miniseries Holocaust and a Tony Award in 1974 for his performance in the play Find Your Way Home. He played Executive Assistant District Attorney Benjamin Stone for the first four seasons (1990–1994) of the television show Law & Order. Moriarty is also known for his roles in films such as Bang the Drum Slowly, Who'll Stop the Rain, Q: The Winged Serpent, The Stuff, Pale Rider, Troll, Courage Under Fire, and Shiloh. Early life </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> From 1990 to 1994, Moriarty starred as Executive Assistant District Attorney Ben Stone on Law & Order. He left the show in 1994, alleging that his departure was a result of his threatening a lawsuit against then-Attorney General Janet Reno, who had cited Law & Order as offensively violent. Moriarty criticized Reno's comment and claimed that she wanted to censor not only shows such as Law & Order, but also such fare as Murder, She Wrote. He later accused Law & Order executive producer Dick Wolf of not taking his concerns seriously and claimed that Wolf and other network executives were 'caving in' to Reno's 'demands' on the issue of TV violence. On September 20, 1994, on The Howard Stern Show, he made an offer to NBC, claiming that he would return to his role on the show if Wolf was fired. Moriarty published a full-page advertisement in a Hollywood trade magazine calling upon fellow artists to stand up with him against attempts to censor TV show content. He subsequently wrote and published The Gift of Stern Angels, his account of this time in his life. In the fictional Law & Order universe, Ben Stone resigns from the D.A.'s office in 1994 after a witness in one of his cases is murdered. The February 7, 2018, episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit shows Sam Waterston's character, Jack McCoy, delivering a eulogy at Stone's funeral. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> It took Jill Hennessy nearly a season to shake off the slight dullness that may have been her legacy from Richard Brooks, who played Ben Stone's original sidekick, Paul Robinette. Brooks was very dull indeed – until his guest-star return in 'Custody,' where the long-absent Robinette loses the flattop that never looked right on him and is reborn as an activist for the African American causes he had to let pass him by in his days in the Manhattan D.A.'s office. Hennessy, always a trifle cowed by Moriarty, came into her own when Waterston joined the series. She seemed to feel freer to use her body; she turned into the sexiest feminist on TV – a welcome anomaly in a puritanical era. Carey Lowell, who stepped in as D.A. Jamie Ross when Hennessy left, is highly competent and has an underused penchant for comedy: her best moment so far has been the grilling of a credulous attorney (Robert Stanton) who fell for her airhead-novice act in 'Shadow.' But the show has yet to spotlight Lowell or Ross in a distinctive way. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Michael Moriarty, the divisive, strange, and brilliant actor who brought Executive ADA Benjamin Stone to life, too had similar struggles. It hadn't interfered with his work on the show until Season 4 came around in September 1993. Then Michael Moriarty completely self-destructed, and any issues that were caused all came to a head in an ugly slugfest between Moriarty, Dick Wolf and the producers, the suits at NBC, and the fucking United States federal government. Whether the story has a happy ending depends entirely on you, and your point of view. I'll say this, it's a happier ending than I thought it was. Which is a good thing, because back when I was that dope sick and emotionally disturbed person lying on that couch, the guy who I could kind of identify with was Ben. Like him, I'm a slightly soft spoken and somewhat socially awkward, but at the same time intelligent, deceptively tough, and highly empathetic, White guy of chiefly Irish-English descent with a receding hairline and something of a Charlie Brown face, though Stone is taller than me (at 6'3-6'4, Moriarty was considered one of the tallest actors in Hollywood in the '70s and '80s) and much more assertive than I am. His actor struggled with a psychological disorder and substance abuse problems for most of his adult life. Being in such a raw emotional state as I was during those times viewing the show on that couch, and relating to the character and the depression that hangs over his onscreen and off-screen exit as much as I did, it's probably no surprise that of all the characters I've written about already and of all the ones I will do write-ups on in the future, my favorite is Ben Stone. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> WARNING: This article contains spoilers from Law and Order.

Moriarty criticized Reno's comment and claimed that she wanted to censor not only shows such as Law & Order, but also such fare as Murder, She Wrote. He later accused Law & Order executive producer Dick Wolf of not taking his concerns seriously and claimed that Wolf and other network executives were 'caving in' to Reno's 'demands' on the issue of TV violence. On September 20, 1994, on The Howard Stern Show, he made an offer to NBC, claiming that he would return to his role on the show if Wolf was fired. Moriarty published a full-page advertisement in a Hollywood trade magazine calling upon fellow artists to stand up with him against attempts to censor TV show content. He subsequently wrote and published The Gift of Stern Angels, his account of this time in his life. In the fictional Law & Order universe, Ben Stone resigns from the D.A.'s office in 1994 after a witness in one of his cases is murdered.

Hennessy, always a trifle cowed by Moriarty, came into her own when Waterston joined the series. She seemed to feel freer to use her body; she turned into the sexiest feminist on TV – a welcome anomaly in a puritanical era. Carey Lowell, who stepped in as D.A. Jamie Ross when Hennessy left, is highly competent and has an underused penchant for comedy: her best moment so far has been the grilling of a credulous attorney (Robert Stanton) who fell for her airhead-novice act in 'Shadow.'

He was the Executive Assistant District Attorney for New York County until his resignation at the end of season four. He appeared in 88 episodes. Character overview Stone works in the Manhattan District Attorney's office under Alfred Wentworth (Roy Thinnes, in the pilot episode 'Everybody's Favorite Bagman') and Adam Schiff (Steven Hill). He was born in 1943 and raised in an Irish Catholic family. He was raised mostly by his Irish grandmother, his father having been an alcoholic. Stone is divorced and has a son, Peter Stone (Philip Winchester), who was the Deputy Chief of the Special Prosecutions Bureau in Chicago and was the Chief ADA of the Sex Crimes Bureau in New York, and a daughter, Pamela (Amy Korb). Stone's prosecutorial methods are portrayed as being grounded in moral principles stemming from his Catholic faith. He is shown to be anti-abortion and opposed to the death penalty. He also is a strong advocate of social justice, having marched in the civil rights movement. It is implied that Stone, like actor Moriarty, is a Dartmouth College alumnus, with references to 'fraternity row' and New Hampshire. Stone is also likely a graduate of New York University Law School, evidenced by the diplomas on his wall in several episodes. Career within the show Stone became Executive Assistant DA in 1985 after convicting con artist and murderer Philip Swann (Željko Ivanek), who years later enters a civil suit against Stone when the validity of the conviction is called into question. Swann is ultimately found guilty, however, and sent back to prison. Stone's assistants have been Paul Robinette (Richard Brooks) and Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennessy). Stone makes his last appearance in the show in the episode 'Old Friends,' the final episode of season four. The episode portrays a racketeering case in which the main witness, Ann Madsen (Allison Janney), whose testimony Stone had secured by threatening to send her to prison, is murdered by the Russian Mafia. He feels responsible for her death and resigns from the DA's office. He is succeeded by Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) as Executive ADA.

Explain to a third-grader: when does the next allegiant movie come out,ETA3G," ""Summit Entertainment announced that the film adaptation of Allegiant, the third and final novel in the Divergent trilogy, would be released in March 2016, serving as the finale of the series"".","<p><b>Source 1:</b> In a new interview, Roth says she was at 'peace' with the fourth film of The Divergent Series getting scrapped. Lionsgate split Roth's third book into two films for a grand finale to the franchise titling it Ascendent, but the film never saw the light of day. 'I mean, breaking things in two was all the rage at the time. That was why that decision was made,' Roth said in an interview with People. 'But at that point, I think I always felt peace about it just because I knew the movies were taking a different track than the books, and if you change the lead-up, you change the ending. So I kind of felt like at that point… I feel like that third movie, I don't know, there's a lot we could talk about with it. But it's its own thing.'

The film got a sequel in 2015 titled Insurgent and based on Roth's second book. Roth's last book titled Allegiant was going to be split into two films, with the first part being released in 2016 and taking its name from the third novel in the series. Ascendent was the title for what would've been the conclusion of The Divergent Series of films, which ultimately got canceled. Despite not having a proper ending, Roth feels like the saga was completed. 'It feels complete to me, relatively speaking, because what does that even mean at that point?' she said. Roth also weighed in on the decision the studio made to split her last book into two films saying, 'I just feel like it's got to be a big, long book in order for that to make sense.' </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The series stars Shailene Woodley and Theo James as lead characters Beatrice Prior (Tris) and Tobias Eaton (Four), respectively. The supporting cast includes Ansel Elgort, Zoë Kravitz, Maggie Q, and Miles Teller. Kate Winslet played the main antagonist in the first two films. The first film in the series was directed by Neil Burger, while the second and third films were directed by Robert Schwentke. The Veronica Roth novels consist primarily of the trilogy of Divergent, Insurgent, and Allegiant. Development began in 2011 following Summit's acquisition of the film rights to the Divergent novel in partnership with production company Red Wagon Entertainment. The studios announced production on the sequel following the first film's strong performance in Thursday late-night screenings, where it grossed $4.9 million. They acquired film rights to the Allegiant novel in December 2013, deciding in April 2014 to split the third novel into a two-part film adaptation. As they search for allies and answers in the wake of the uprising, Tris and Four are on the run. Hunted by Jeanine Matthews, the leader of the Erudite faction, Tris and Four race against time as they try to figure out what Abnegation sacrificed their lives to protect and the reason that the Erudite leaders will do anything to stop them. Haunted by her past choices but desperate to protect the people she loves, Tris faces one impossible challenge after another as she unlocks the truth about the past and, ultimately, the future of her world. The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016) Main article: The Divergent Series: Allegiant On December 16, 2013, Summit Entertainment announced that the film adaptation of Allegiant would be released on March 18, 2016. On April 11, 2014, Lionsgate announced that the film adaptation would be split into two films with the first part titled, The Divergent Series: Allegiant – Part 1. The film was then retitled as The Divergent Series: Allegiant. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Also in December 2013, Summit Entertainment announced that the film adaptation of Allegiant, the third and final novel in the Divergent trilogy, would be released in March 2016, serving as the finale of the series, which at the time was planned as a trilogy, but on April 11, 2014, the studio decided to split the novel into a two-part film, much the like the Harry Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Games franchises did with the finales of their series. Lionsgate Motion Picture Group co-chairmen Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger said in a statement that, 'Veronica Roth brings her captivating story to a masterful conclusion in 'Allegiant,' a rich, action-packed book with material that is ideally suited to two strong and fulfilling movies. The storytelling arc and world of the characters lend themselves perfectly to two films, a storytelling strategy that has worked very well for us on the two Twilight Breaking Dawn films and about which we're tremendously enthusiastic for the two upcoming Mockingjay films of The Hunger Games franchise'. Noah Oppenheim was announced as the screenwriter for the first part of the Allegiant adaptation on July 9, 2014. On December 5, 2014, it was announced that Robert Schwentke will return to direct Part 1. On September 10, 2015, it was announced that the two films would be re-titled, with Part 1 being renamed as The Divergent Series: Allegiant and Part 2 as The Divergent Series: Ascendant. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Filming for the franchise began on April 16, 2013. Lucy Fisher, Douglas Wick, and Pouya Shabazian have been producers for all films in the series. Veronica Roth and Neil Burger have acted as executive producers on the first two films. Summit Entertainment and Lionsgate collaborated on all three films. On April 11, 2014, the studio decided to split the final book, Allegiant, into two parts, much like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Parts 1 and 2, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Parts 1 and 2, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Parts 1 and 2. Directors </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> It's been over seven years since Allegiant, the third movie in the franchise, debuted in theaters, adapting one half of Roth's book. Like the Harry Potter, Twilight and Hunger Games finales before it, Allegiant was split in two parts, though the second part (to be titled Ascendant) was never made due to diminishing box office returns. Roth tells PEOPLE she's okay with how the film franchise concluded. 'I mean, breaking things in two was all the rage at the time. That was why that decision was made,' says Roth, 35. 'But at that point, I think I always felt peace about it just because I knew the movies were taking a different track than the books, and if you change the lead up, you change the ending. So I kind of felt like at that point ... I feel like that third movie, I don't know — there's a lot we could talk about with it. But it's its own thing.' 'It feels complete to me, relatively speaking, because what does that even mean at that point?' she adds. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Prior to the release of The Divergent Series: Allegiant, there were already signs that the general public's interest in the franchise was waning. The second movie only topped the original's total gross by a tiny margin. When Allegiant grossed less than $180 million worldwide, compared to the $300 million Insurgent made the year before (via Box Office Mojo), the studios realized they could no longer confidently invest in the YA dystopian movies for a considerable profit at the box office. Since The Divergent Series: Allegiant split the final book in Roth's trilogy into two films, the final movie's production was scheduled to begin after its predecessor hit theaters. However, the meager financial returns of Allegiant halted those plans, and in July 2016, it was announced that a TV movie would conclude the story. The cast response to this was far from enthusiastic, and the reality was that the cost of the movies had only increased with each venture. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> None of the original cast of the three previous Divergent movies was interested in making the jump from three big-budget blockbusters to a TV movie, let alone one that acted as a pilot for a potential series. Although Woodley wanted to return to complete Tris' story, she only expressed willingness for a theatrical movie. The actress later admitted how disappointed she was with the saga's ending that she even considered quitting acting entirely. This similar lack of interest from the original cast eventually killed The Divergent Series: Ascendant in 2018, after years of development. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> The Divergent Series: Allegiant is the latest Divergent movies that comes out at March 10 in England and March 18 in USA starring Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Jeff Daniels, Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, Maggie Q, With Octavia Spencer, and Naomi Watts. Once again, Shailene Woddley is bringing the best performance through the whole movie, We get to see more of Tobias in this one instead of just Woodley's character, Tris. The Visual Effects were amazing, The cinematography was incredible and of course, The acting was fantastic, Especially Woodley. It's a lot more action packed than Insurgent and Divergent, there's a lot of running, the wall sequences that we see in the trailer was the best action scene in the movie.

These records not only represent an era of timeless hits, but also sparked a generation of unforgettable wedding music we all know and love. Today, romantic tracks have moved past the formula of soft ballads, and can now be heard in a variety of genres like indie, pop, and more upbeat R&B tunes. Regardless of the song's tempo, though, it's the lyrics that truly make a song memorable and worthy to be played on a couple's special day. Just look at the last 62 years of hits, and you'll find evidence of lyrics of love sprinkled throughout almost every wedding day celebration. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Quote by George R.R.

Explain to a third-grader: what is the hierarchy of the episcopal church,ETA3G,"""The Episcopal Church is governed by a bicameral General Convention, which meets every three years, and by an Executive Council during interim years.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> In contrast, the Episcopal Church puts an emphasis on shared authority. It operates under a polity that includes both episcopal and synodical governance. While bishops oversee the religious and pastoral works much like their Catholic counterparts, key decisions regarding doctrine, liturgy and property are made collaboratively in conventions comprising both clergy and laity. The Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, although holding a position of respect and responsibility, does not possess the same level of authoritative power as the Pope in the Catholic Church. Beloved readers, these structural differences may seem minor on paper, yet their impacts are deeply felt in the life and governance of each church. From them, one can see the ways in which power, governance, and religious practice intertwine, shaping and being shaped by the very structures they inhabit. Do Episcopalians and Catholics have different views on the sacraments? </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Both Episcopal Church and Catholic Church affirm the foundational role of the seven sacraments as vehicles of God's grace. Catholic theology presents specific interpretation of these sacraments, namely the doctrine of transubstantiation with regard to the Eucharist. Episcopalians maintain a broader theological perspective that incorporates Catholic tradition and Reformed views, resulting in a range of interpretations within sacramental theology. The diversity in the approach to sacraments underscores the dynamic nature of the Christian faith, reflecting the diversity within these faith communities. How are Episcopal and Catholic views on social issues different? </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The chair (cathedra) of the Bishop of Rome (Pope) of the Catholic Church in the Archbasilica of St. John in Lateran in Rome, Italy, represents his episcopal authority. An episcopal polity is a hierarchical form of church governance ('ecclesiastical polity') in which the chief local authorities are called bishops. The word 'bishop' here is derived via the British Latin and Vulgar Latin term *ebiscopus/*biscopus, from the Ancient Greek ἐπίσκοπος epískopos meaning 'overseer'. It is the structure used by many of the major Christian Churches and denominations, such as the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Anabaptist, Lutheran, and Anglican churches or denominations, and other churches founded independently from these lineages.[citation needed] Many Methodist denominations have a form of episcopal polity known as connexionalism. History Bishops are considered to derive their authority from an unbroken, personal apostolic succession from the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Bishops with such authority are said to represent the historical episcopate or historic episcopate. Churches with this type of government usually believe that the Church requires episcopal government as described in the New Testament (see 1 Timothy 3 and 2 Timothy 1). In some systems, bishops may be subject in limited ways to bishops holding a higher office (variously called archbishops, metropolitans, or patriarchs, depending upon the tradition). They also meet in councils or synods. These gatherings, subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops, usually make important decisions, though the synod or council may also be purely advisory. For much of the written history of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the Reformation. Many Protestant churches are now organized by either congregational or presbyterian church polities, both descended from the writings of John Calvin, a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the Catholic Church precipitated by The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther. However, some people have disputed the episcopal polity before the reformation, such as Aerius of Sebaste in the 4th century. Overview of episcopal churches The government of a bishop is typically symbolized by a cathedral church, such as the bishops's see at Chartres Cathedral. The definition of the word episcopal has variation among Christian traditions. There are subtle differences in governmental principles among episcopal churches at the present time. To some extent the separation of episcopal churches can be traced to these differences in ecclesiology, that is, their theological understanding of church and church governance. For some, 'episcopal churches' are churches that use a hierarchy of bishops who identify as being in an unbroken, personal apostolic succession. 'Episcopal' is also commonly used to distinguish between the various organizational structures of denominations. For instance, 'Presbyterian' (Greek: πρεσβύτερος, presbýteros) is used to describe a church governed by a hierarchy of assemblies of elected elders, referred to as presbyterian polity. Similarly, 'episcopal' is used to describe a church governed by bishops. Self-governed local congregations, governed neither by elders nor bishops, are usually described as 'congregational'. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The conciliar idea of episcopal government continues in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In Eastern Orthodoxy, all autocephalous primates are seen as collectively gathering around Christ, with other archbishops and bishops gathering around them, and so forth. There is no single primate with exclusive authority comparable to the Pope in Rome. However, the Patriarch of Constantinople (now Istanbul) is seen as the primus inter pares, the 'first among equals' of the autocephalous churches of Eastern Orthodoxy. Oriental Orthodox churches </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Functionally, Anglican episcopal authority is expressed synodically, although individual provinces may accord their primate with more or less authority to act independently. Called variously 'synods', 'councils', or 'conventions', they meet under episcopal chairmanship. In many jurisdictions, conciliar resolutions that have been passed require episcopal assent or consent to take force. Seen in this way, Anglicans often speak of 'the bishop-in-synod' as the force and authority of episcopal governance. Such conciliar authority extends to the standard areas of doctrine, discipline, and worship, but in these regards is limited by Anglicanism's tradition of the limits of authority. Those limits are expressed in Article XXI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, ratified in 1571 (significantly, just as the Council of Trent was drawing to a close), which held that 'General Councils ... may err, and sometimes have erred ... wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture.' Hence, Anglican jurisdictions have traditionally been conservative in their approach to either innovative doctrinal development or in encompassing actions of the church as doctrinal (see lex orandi, lex credendi). Anglican synodical government, though varied in expression, is characteristically representative. Provinces of the Anglican Communion, their ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses are governed by councils consisting not only of bishops, but also representatives of the presbyterate and laity. There is no international juridical authority in Anglicanism, although the tradition's common experience of episcopacy, symbolised by the historical link with the See of Canterbury, along with a common and complex liturgical tradition, has provided a measure of unity. This has been reinforced by the Lambeth Conferences of Anglican Communion bishops, which first met in 1867. These conferences, though they propose and pass resolutions, are strictly consultative, and the intent of the resolutions is to provide guideposts for Anglican jurisdictions—not direction. The Conferences also express the function of the episcopate to demonstrate the ecumenical and catholic nature of the church. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The Episcopal Church is governed by a bicameral General Convention, which meets every three years, and by an Executive Council during interim years. The General Convention consists of the House of Bishops and the House of Deputies. The House of Bishops is composed of every bishop with jurisdiction (diocesan bishop), every bishop coadjutor, every suffragan bishop, every retired bishop, every bishop elected to an office created by General Convention, and every bishop who has resigned because of mission strategy – each of whom has a seat and vote. The House may also elect collegial members who are admitted with seat and voice, but no vote. Collegial members are bishops in the Anglican Communion who serve extra-provincial dioceses. The House of Deputies is composed of up to four lay and four clerical deputies from each of the jurisdictions, domestic and overseas, elected in the manner determined by each jurisdiction. </p>",2025-11-19 19:58:59-08:00,False,Response is valid.

The newly created Legislative Assembly wanted to spread the revolution across Europe. In April 1792, France declared war on Austria. The war went badly, and Louis XVI was blamed. Accused of treason, he was stripped of his title and imprisoned. In September 1792 a new National Convention declared France a republic and abolished the monarchy. On January 21, 1793, Louis XVI was marched to the guillotine. His severed head was paraded for the gathered thousands and met with cries of 'Vive la Republique!' Maximilien Robespierre, Courtesy: Library of Congress Madame Guillotine On September 5, 1793, Maximilien Robespierre began the Reign of Terror in response to the invasion of France by foreign troops. Thousands of so-called counterrevolutionaries were slaughtered; estimates range from 14,000 to 40,000. France remained in Robespierre's bloody grip for 10 months until he too was captured and beheaded. With the Reign of Terror over, France found some peace, but the country remained at war with Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Spain following Louis XVI's execution.

It was set in type and printed on July 4, 1776, then distributed to the colonies.

It's roughly in line with William Ellery's autograph, which is the second largest on the Declaration. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The engrossed parchment is what most people think of as 'the' Declaration of Independence: the document on display in the National Archives, alongside the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights. It is a parchment sheet measuring 29 3/4 inches high by 24 1/4 inches wide. Unlike paper, parchment was a sturdier, longer-lasting material, and was also used for the Articles of Confederation, United States Constitution, and Bill of Rights. To 'fairly engross' means to copy in large, legible script, to create an official copy of a document. The person tasked with engrossing the Declaration of Independence was most likely Timothy Matlack. No official record exists, so historians rely on comparisons of Matlack's handwriting and his position as an assistant to Secretary of Congress Charles Thomson as evidence. Matlack used an English Roundhand script, and neatly wrote with a quill pen, making only two errors. He also engrossed the 1774 Petition to the King and George Washington's Commission as Commander-in-Chief. National Treasure fans may remember Matlack's name from a riddle Nicholas Cage's character discovered in the pipe from the Charlotte: 'The legend writ, the stain affected. The key in Silence undetected. Fifty-five in iron pen, Mr. Matlack cannot offend.' Technically it should be fifty-six, but if we start quibbling with National Treasure, this blog will be too long... And for the record, here is what the back of the engrossed parchment looks like (no treasure map...). When was the Declaration of Independence signed? Historians believe that the Declaration of Independence was signed by the majority of the delegates on August 2nd, 1776. Timothy Matlack engrossed the Declaration on parchment sometime between July 19th and August 1st. According to the Journals of the Continental Congress, on August 2nd,'The declaration of independence being engrossed and compared at the table was signed.'49 delegates most likely signed on August 2nd, including President of Congress John Hancock. Seven delegates were absent from Continental Congress on August 2nd, and must have signed later. Due to his exclusion from the Goddard broadside, we believe Thomas McKean was the last delegate to sign, sometime after January 1777. Who signed? 56 delegates (including President of Congress John Hancock) representing each of the United States signed the Declaration of Independence. But as we explored in No John Trumbull, not every signer was present for the debates and the vote for independence, and not everyone who voted for independence went on to sign the engrossed parchment.Eight men who were present on July 2nd never signed the Declaration, including most of the Pennsylvanians who either abstained from voting or voted against independence: John Dickinson, Charles Humphreys, and Thomas Willing. The other Pennsylvanian delegate who abstained -- Robert Morris -- signed on August 2nd. The New York delegation abstained from voting on July 2nd, and four delegates -- John Alsop, George Clinton, Robert R. Livingston, and Henry Wisner -- never signed the Declaration of Independence. Remember, Robert R. Livingston was a member of the Committee of Five, and yet not a signer. Conversely, eight men signed who weren't even elected to Congress until after July 4th: Matthew Thornton (NH), William Williams (CT), Benjamin Rush (PA), George Clymer (PA), James Smith (PA), George Taylor (PA), George Ross (PA), and Charles Carroll of Carrollton (MD). Thornton famously requested permission to sign the Declaration of Independence, even though he wasn't elected to the Continental Congress until September 1776.The one delegate who voted for independence and never signed the Declaration of Independence was John Rogers of Maryland. The one delegate who voted against independence and still signed the Declaration of Independence was George Read of Delaware. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> To begin, the legend of Hancock signing his name large enough for King George III to read it without his spectacles is just that -- legend. There is no contemporary evidence for what Hancock said as he signed, and at the very least, we know that the engrossed parchment was not sent to King George III. But Hancock did sign front and center, and it is assumed that, as President of Congress, he signed the Declaration of Independence first. The next signature would have likely been Josiah Bartlett of New Hampshire. Perhaps it was his signature that started the trend of signing slightly smaller than Hancock. Besides the spectacles comment, there are a number of quotations from the signing for which we have no evidence. Stephen Hopkins declaring 'My hand trembles, but my heart does not!' Benjamin Franklin's acknowledgement that, 'We must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.' The rotund Benjamin Harrison commenting that, should they hang, he would have the advantage of dying quickly while skinnier delegate Elbridge Gerry would 'kick in the air half an hour after it is over with me.' Though there may have been one-liners such as these and moments of levity, according to Benjamin Rush, the mood was somber on August 2nd. In a letter to John Adams in 1811, Rush recalled, 'the solicitude and labors, and fears, and sorrows and sleepless nights of the men who projected, proposed, defended, and Subscribed the declaration of independance...' and asked Adams, 'Do you recollect the pensive and awful silence which pervaded the house when we were called up, one after another, to the table of the President of Congress, to subscribe what was believed by many at that time to be our own death warrants?' </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> By the time I make my way to the hallowed hall, the crowds have cleared and I have the opportunity to survey the 56 signatures of the men who composed the Second Continental Congress. One name stands out among them and it just so happens that it belongs to my namesake, John Hancock. His signature has become synonymous with patriotism and defiance in the face of tyranny. But very few people from the first two generations of Americans ever viewed the actual document that signaled the break from England. For them, the Declaration was broadcast aloud from the steps of their local government buildings or as printed text. The great portion of citizens were provided with a printed copy of the Declaration of Independence, not the original parchment that was once handled by our founders. John Hancock by Alonzo Chapel. (National Archives Identifier 135797826) That made the signatures on the Declaration, especially that of John Hancock, icons of patriotism. The signing of the document became just as significant as Congress's votes to approve the measure, although the signing did not commence until August 2. Those 56 members of Congress have become figures of immense historical significance and elevated in public memory above all of the other delegates at that time. And dramatic tales of how they put pen to parchment have become almost mythical in nature. Soon after the Colonial Revival of the late 1800s, many historians became skeptical of these stories. One narrative that received particular scrutiny was John Hancock's motivation for producing his large signature. One anecdote provides the following: </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Of the fifty-five delegates who attended the convention 34 were lawyers, 8 had signed the Declaration of Independence, and almost half were Revolutionary War veterans. The remaining members were planters, educators, ministers, physicians, financiers, judges and merchants. About a quarter of them were large land owners and all of them held some type of public office (39 were former Congressmen and 8 were present or past governors). William Few of Georgia was the only member to represent the yeoman farmer class which comprised the majority of the population of the country. Nineteen of the members who were chosen to represent their state never attended a meeting. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania was known as the 'Sage of the Constitutional Convention.' He was also the mediator at the convention and often counseled that 'we are here to consult, not to contend'. George Washington and James Madison were the only Presidents who signed the Constitution. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> There are 56 signatures on the Declaration of Independence. Fifty men from 13 states signed the document on August 2 in 1776. The other six signed over the course of the next year and a half.

Some of the men abbreviated their first names, like Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. All of the signers risked their lives when they signed the Declaration of Independence.

Historians believe that the Declaration of Independence was signed by the majority of the delegates on August 2nd, 1776. Timothy Matlack engrossed the Declaration on parchment sometime between July 19th and August 1st. According to the Journals of the Continental Congress, on August 2nd,'The declaration of independence being engrossed and compared at the table was signed.'49 delegates most likely signed on August 2nd, including President of Congress John Hancock. Seven delegates were absent from Continental Congress on August 2nd, and must have signed later. Due to his exclusion from the Goddard broadside, we believe Thomas McKean was the last delegate to sign, sometime after January 1777. Who signed? 56 delegates (including President of Congress John Hancock) representing each of the United States signed the Declaration of Independence. But as we explored in No John Trumbull, not every signer was present for the debates and the vote for independence, and not everyone who voted for independence went on to sign the engrossed parchment.Eight men who were present on July 2nd never signed the Declaration, including most of the Pennsylvanians who either abstained from voting or voted against independence: John Dickinson, Charles Humphreys, and Thomas Willing. The other Pennsylvanian delegate who abstained -- Robert Morris -- signed on August 2nd. The New York delegation abstained from voting on July 2nd, and four delegates -- John Alsop, George Clinton, Robert R. Livingston, and Henry Wisner -- never signed the Declaration of Independence. Remember, Robert R. Livingston was a member of the Committee of Five, and yet not a signer. Conversely, eight men signed who weren't even elected to Congress until after July 4th: Matthew Thornton (NH), William Williams (CT), Benjamin Rush (PA), George Clymer (PA), James Smith (PA), George Taylor (PA), George Ross (PA), and Charles Carroll of Carrollton (MD). Thornton famously requested permission to sign the Declaration of Independence, even though he wasn't elected to the Continental Congress until September 1776.The one delegate who voted for independence and never signed the Declaration of Independence was John Rogers of Maryland.

It encompasses two theme parks, seven Disney-owned hotels, two convention centers, a golf course, and a shopping, dining and entertainment complex. Opened on 12 April 1992, the resort is operated by Disney Experiences, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It is the second Disney park outside the United States, following the opening of the Tokyo Disney Resort in 1983, and the largest. Disneyland Paris is also the only Disney resort outside of the United States to be completely owned by the company. Disneyland Park, opened in 1992, is the original theme park of the complex. A second theme park, Walt Disney Studios Park, opened in 2002. The resort is located on approximately 2,100 hectares (5,200 acres) of land which is being developed under a master agreement with French governmental authorities. About half of the land has been developed, including a planned community, Val d'Europe. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most-visited tourist destination, and the largest single-site employer in France with 17,000 employees. It generated $343 million in profit for Disney in 2023. By 2022, 375 million people had visited the park. Ownership The Walt Disney Company announced a €1 billion plan (equivalent to US$1.25 billion at the time) to rescue the financially struggling Disneyland Paris resort, the Financial Times reported on 6 October 2014. The park was burdened by its debt, which at the time was calculated at about €1.75 billion (US$2.2 billion), roughly 15 times its gross average earnings. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Following the success of Disneyland in California, plans to build a similar theme park in Europe emerged in 1966 with sites in Frankfurt, Paris, London or Milan under consideration. Under the leadership of E. Cardon Walker, Tokyo Disneyland opened in 1983 in Japan with instant success, forming a catalyst for international expansion. In late 1984 the heads of Disney's theme park division, Dick Nunis and Jim Cora, presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible European locations for the park. Britain, France, Italy and Spain were all considered. However, Britain and Italy were dropped from the list due to both lacking a suitable expanse of flat land. By March 1985, the number of possible locations for the park had been reduced to four; two in France and two in Spain. Both nations saw the potential economic advantages of a Disney theme park and offered competing financing deals to Disney. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Unlike Disney's American theme parks, Euro Disney aimed for permanent employees (an estimated requirement of 12,000 for the theme park itself), as opposed to seasonal and temporary part-time employees. Casting centres were set up in Paris, London, and Amsterdam. However, it was understood by the French government and Disney that 'a concentrated effort would be made to tap into the local French labour market'. Disney sought workers with sufficient communication skills, who spoke two European languages (French and one other), and were socially outgoing. Following precedent, Euro Disney set up its own Disney University to train workers. 24,000 people had applied by November 1991. In 2011, the park provided 55,643 direct and indirect jobs in France. According to Damien Audric, Director of Development and the Environment, Disneyland Paris would generate 63,000 jobs by 2022. Overall, in 2022, Disneyland Paris was still Seine-et-Marne's largest employer. Controversies </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Despite these efforts in May 1992, park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. The Euro Disney Company stock price spiraled downward and on 23 July 1992, Euro Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million French francs. During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was so low that it was decided to close the Newport Bay Club hotel during the season. Initial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts found spending to be around 12% lower. Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began 12 June 1993. On 1 October 1994, Euro Disney changed its name to Disneyland Paris. On 31 May 1995, a new attraction opened at the theme park. Space Mountain: De la Terre à la Lune had been planned since the inception of Disneyland Paris under the name Discovery Mountain, but was reserved for a revival of public interest. With a redesign of the attraction (which had premiered as Space Mountain at the Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom in 1975) including a 'cannon launch' system, inversions, and an on-ride soundtrack, the US$100 million attraction was dedicated in a ceremony attended by celebrities such as Elton John, Claudia Schiffer, and Buzz Aldrin. On 25 July 1995, Disneyland Paris reported its first quarterly profit of US$35.3 million. On 15 November 1995, the results for the fiscal year ending 30 September 1995 were released; in one year the theme park's attendance had climbed from 8.8 million to 10.7 million, an increase of 21%.

Explain to a third-grader: where were the soviet missiles located in cuba,ETA3G,"""the island of Cuba""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> In May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles. Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a 'splendid first strike' capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union. The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> In early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro. The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp. The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a 'nuclear umbrella' for attacks upon the island. By May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans 'with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles'.: 29  The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on 4 July and Khrushchev on 7 July. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Specialists in missile construction, under the guise of machine operators and agricultural specialists, arrived in July. A total of 43,000 foreign troops would ultimately be brought in. Chief Marshal of Artillery Sergei Biryuzov, Head of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that visited Cuba. He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees. The Soviet troops would arrive in Cuba heavily underprepared. They did not know that the tropical climate would render ineffective many of their weapons and much of their equipment. In the first few days of setting up the missiles, troops complained of fuse failures, excessive corrosion, overconsumption of oil, and generator blackouts. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Missiles reported The missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US. The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles. Only five reports bothered the analysts. They described large trucks passing through towns at night that were carrying very long canvas-covered cylindrical objects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and maneuvering. Defensive missile transporters, it was believed, could make such turns without undue difficulty. The reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed. A U-2 reconnaissance photograph of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles, their transports and tents for fueling and maintenance Aerial confirmation </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The Cuban Missile Crisis was solved in part by a secret agreement between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. The Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was known to only 9 US officials at the time of its creation in October 1963 and was first officially acknowledged at a conference in Moscow in January 1989 by Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin and Kennedy's speechwriter Theodore Sorensen. In his negotiations with Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed 'within a short time after this crisis was over'.: 222  Under an operation code-named Operation Pot Pie, the removal of the Jupiters from Italy and Turkey began on 1 April, and was completed by 24 April 1963. The initial plans were to recycle the missiles for use in other programs, but NASA and the USAF were not interested in retaining the missile hardware. The missile bodies were destroyed on site, while warheads, guidance packages, and launching equipment worth $14 million were returned to the United States. The dismantling operations were named Pot Pie I for Italy and Pot Pie II for Turkey by the United States Air Force. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> After the failed U.S. attempt to overthrow the Castro regime in Cuba with the Bay of Pigs invasion, and while the Kennedy administration planned Operation Mongoose, in July 1962 Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev reached a secret agreement with Cuban premier Fidel Castro to place Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba to deter any future invasion attempt. Construction of several missile sites began in the late summer, but U.S. intelligence discovered evidence of a general Soviet arms build-up on Cuba, including Soviet IL–28 bombers, during routine surveillance flights, and on September 4, 1962, President Kennedy issued a public warning against the introduction of offensive weapons into Cuba. Despite the warning, on October 14 a U.S. U–2 aircraft took several pictures clearly showing sites for medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) under construction in Cuba. These images were processed and presented </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> In the early stages of the Cuban missile crisis, this photograph showed that the Soviet Union was amassing offensive ballistic missiles in Cuba. President John F. Kennedy warned that any attempt by the Soviet Union to place nuclear weapons in Cuba would be seen as a threat to the United States. Throughout 1962, in the midst of the Cold War, the movement of Soviet personnel and equipment to Cuba had aroused suspicions in the American intelligence community. In response, U.S. ships and planes began photographing every Cuba-bound Soviet vessel, and U-2 spy planes began regular reconnaissance flights over the island, just 90 miles off the coast of Florida. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Throughout 1962, the movement of Soviet personnel and equipment to Cuba had aroused suspicions in the American intelligence community. In response, U.S. ships and planes began photographing every Cuba-bound Soviet vessel, and U-2 spy planes began regular reconnaissance flights over the island. The first evidence of the arrival in Cuba of surface-to-air missiles, missile-equipped torpedo boats for coastal defense, and large numbers of Soviet military personnel came in photographs taken in late August. But these pictures provided no evidence of offensive ballistic missiles. In September, Kennedy delivered two explicit warnings to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev regarding the buildup of what were being called 'defensive' Soviet arms in Cuba. </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> In October 1962, an American U-2 spy plane secretly photographed nuclear missile sites being built by the Soviet Union on the island of Cuba. President Kennedy did not want the Soviet Union and Cuba to know that he had discovered the missiles. He met in secret with his advisors for several days to discuss the problem. After many long and difficult meetings, Kennedy decided to place a naval blockade, or a ring of ships, around Cuba. The aim of this 'quarantine,' as he called it, was to prevent the Soviets from bringing in more military supplies. He demanded the removal of the missiles already there and the destruction of the sites. On October 22, President Kennedy spoke to the nation about the crisis in a televised address.

The worldwide, catastrophic Flood of Noah's day would have destroyed the surface of the earth. If most of the sedimentary strata over the earth's surface (many thousands of feet thick in places) is the result of this global catastrophe as creationists believe, then we would have no idea where the Garden of Eden was originally located—the earth's surface totally changed as a result of the Flood.

In ancient times, the Tigris nurtured the Assyrian Empire, with remnants like the relief of King Tiglath-Pileser. The Tigris is home to archaeological sites and ancient religious communities, including the Mandaeans, who use it for baptism. Today, the Tigris faces modern threats from geopolitical instability, dam projects, poor water management, and climate change, leading to concerns about its sustainability. Efforts to protect and preserve the river's legacy are ongoing, with local archaeologists and activists working to safeguard its future. Etymology Bedouin crossing the river Tigris with plunder (c. 1860) The Tigris is 1,750 km (1,090 mi) long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about 25 km (16 mi) southeast of the city of Elazığ and about 30 km (19 mi) from the headwaters of the Euphrates. The river then flows for 400 km (250 mi) through Southeastern Turkey before forming part of the Syria-Turkey border. This stretch of 44 km (27 mi) is the only part of the river that is located in Syria. Some of its affluences are Garzan, Anbarçayi, Batman, and the Great and the Little Zab. Close to its confluence with the Euphrates, the Tigris splits into several channels. First, the artificial Shatt al-Hayy branches off, to join the Euphrates near Nasiriyah. Second, the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir branch off to feed the Central Marshes. Further downstream, two other distributary channels branch off (the Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla), to feed the Hawizeh Marshes. The main channel continues southwards and is joined by the Al-Kassarah, which drains the Hawizeh Marshes. Finally, the Tigris joins the Euphrates near al-Qurnah to form the Shatt-al-Arab. According to Pliny and other ancient historians, the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris. Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, stands on the banks of the Tigris. The port city of Basra straddles the Shatt al-Arab. In ancient times, many of the great cities of Mesopotamia stood on or near the Tigris, drawing water from it to irrigate the civilization of the Sumerians. Notable Tigris-side cities included Nineveh, Ctesiphon, and Seleucia, while the city of Lagash was irrigated by the Tigris via a canal dug around 2900 B.C. Navigation The Tigris has long been an important transport route in a largely desert country. Shallow-draft vessels can go as far as Baghdad, but rafts have historically been needed for transport downstream from Mosul. Management and water quality Batman River The Tigris is heavily dammed in Iraq and Turkey to provide water for irrigating the arid and semi-desert regions bordering the river valley. Damming has also been important for averting floods in Iraq, to which the Tigris has historically been notoriously prone following April melting of snow in the Turkish mountains. Mosul Dam is the largest dam in Iraq. Recent Turkish damming of the river has been the subject of some controversy, for both its environmental effects within Turkey and its potential to reduce the flow of water downstream. Water from both rivers is used as a means of pressure during conflicts. In 2014 a major breakthrough in developing consensus between multiple stakeholder representatives of Iraq and Turkey on a Plan of Action for promoting exchange and calibration of data and standards pertaining to Tigris river flows was achieved. The consensus, known as the 'Geneva Consensus On Tigris River', was reached at a meeting organized in Geneva by the think tank Strategic Foresight Group. In February 2016, the United States Embassy in Iraq as well as the Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi issued warnings that Mosul Dam could collapse. The United States warned people to evacuate the floodplain of the Tigris because between 500,000 and 1.5 million people were at risk of drowning due to flash flood if the dam collapses, and that the major Iraqi cities of Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad were at risk. Religion and mythology In Sumerian mythology, the Tigris was created by the god Enki, who filled the river with flowing water.

In this atmosphere, Harrison had initially been reluctant to present his new compositions to the group.

Along with the change in networks and the transition to color, Tim Considine (who had earlier worked with Fred MacMurray on The Shaggy Dog), playing eldest son Mike, had chosen not to renew his contract due to a clash with executive producer Don Fedderson over Considine's wish to direct but not co-star in the series. (Considine did, however, direct one of the last black-and-white episodes for ABC.) In an August 1989 interview on the Pat Sajak Show, he explained that he was also devoted to car racing, which his contract forbade. His character was written out, along with Meredith MacRae, who had played his fiancée Sally, in a wedding episode that was the premiere of the 1965–1966 season on CBS. After this episode, Mike is mentioned briefly in only four succeeding episodes (including the one in which the family adopts Ernie) and is never seen again, even at Robbie's or Steve's weddings. (Steve explains briefly in one of these episodes that he has another son who 'lives away from home'.) In the episode 'Steve and the Huntress' (first aired January 27, 1966), Mike is specifically mentioned as teaching at a college. MacRae joined Petticoat Junction the following year, the last of three actresses to play Billie Jo Bradley. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> While the three sons were always central to the storyline, several major changes took place by the late 1960s. In the spring of 1967, the series' ratings began to sag, and it finished its seventh season in 31st place in the Nielsen ratings. It was decided that the 1967–1968 season would bring the program not only a new time slot but also new storylines to spice up the ratings. In the fall of 1967, CBS moved My Three Sons to Saturday at 8:30 pm ET. In the season premiere episode, 'Moving Day', the Douglas family and Uncle Charley relocate from the fictional Midwestern town of Bryant Park to Los Angeles, California. Robbie (Don Grady) marries his girlfriend Katie Miller. Katie is played by Tina Cole, who had appeared in different roles on three previous episodes: 'House For Sale' from the fourth season (February 13, 1964), 'The Coffee House Set' from the fifth season (November 19, 1964), and 'Robbie and the Little Stranger' from the sixth season (February 17, 1966). At the end of the 1967–1968 season, the ratings had improved from the previous year with the series placing at 24th in the Nielsens. The following season, the newlyweds discover that Katie is pregnant and she gives birth to triplets named Robert, Steven, and Charles. Originally played by sets of uncredited twins, the boys were later played uncredited by Guy, Gunnar, and Garth Swanson; and in the last two seasons by Michael, Daniel, and Joseph Todd. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> My Three Sons moved to CBS for the 1965-66 season.

","<p><b>Source 1:</b> My Three Sons moved to the CBS television network for the 1965–1966 season after ABC declined to underwrite the expense of producing the program in color. Along with the change in networks and the transition to color, Tim Considine (who had earlier worked with Fred MacMurray on The Shaggy Dog), playing eldest son Mike, had chosen not to renew his contract due to a clash with executive producer Don Fedderson over Considine's wish to direct but not co-star in the series. (Considine did, however, direct one of the last black-and-white episodes for ABC.) In an August 1989 interview on the Pat Sajak Show, he explained that he was also devoted to car racing, which his contract forbade. His character was written out, along with Meredith MacRae, who had played his fiancée Sally, in a wedding episode that was the premiere of the 1965–1966 season on CBS. After this episode, Mike is mentioned briefly in only four succeeding episodes (including the one in which the family adopts Ernie) and is never seen again, even at Robbie's or Steve's weddings. (Steve explains briefly in one of these episodes that he has another son who 'lives away from home'.) In the episode 'Steve and the Huntress' (first aired January 27, 1966), Mike is specifically mentioned as teaching at a college.

Explain to a third-grader: when did the romanticism period start and end,ETA3G,"""The consensus is that Romanticism peaked from 1800 until 1850.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Romanticist movement had a particular fondness for the Middle Ages, which to them represented an era of chivalry, heroism, and a more organic relationship between humans and their environment. This idealization contrasted sharply with the values of their contemporary industrial society, which they considered alienating for its economic materialism and environmental degradation. The movement's illustration of the Middle Ages was a key theme in debates, with allegations that Romanticist portrayals often overlooked the downsides of medieval life. The consensus is that Romanticism peaked from 1800 until 1850. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Romanticism was a complex movement, with a variety of viewpoints that permeated Western civilization across the globe. The movement and its opposing ideologies mutually shaped each other as time went on. After its end, Romantic thought and art exerted a sweeping influence on art and music, speculative fiction, philosophy, politics, and environmentalism that has endured into the present day. The movement is the reference for the modern notion of 'romanticization' and the act of 'romanticizing' something. Overview Timeline For most of the Western world, Romanticism was at its peak from approximately 1800 to 1850. The first Romantic ideas arose from an earlier German Counter-Enlightenment movement called Sturm und Drang (German: 'Storm and Stress'). This movement directly criticized the Enlightenment's position that humans can fully comprehend the world through rationality alone, suggesting that intuition and emotion are key components of insight and understanding. Published in 1774, 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe began to shape the Romanticist movement and its ideals. The events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also direct influences on the movement; many early Romantics throughout Europe sympathized with the ideals and achievements of French revolutionaries. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as the glorification of the past and nature, preferring the medieval over the classical. Romanticism was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, and the prevailing ideology of the Age of Enlightenment, especially the scientific rationalization of Nature. The movement's ideals were embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature; it also had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences. Romanticism had a significant and complex effect on politics: Romantic thinking influenced conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and nationalism. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. Margaret Drabble described it in literature as taking place 'roughly between 1770 and 1848', and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, M. H. Abrams placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics. Others have proposed 1780–1830. In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; musical Romanticism, for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the Four Last Songs of Richard Strauss are described stylistically as 'Late Romantic' and were composed in 1946–48. However, in most fields the Romantic period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier. The early period of the Romantic era was a time of war, with the French Revolution (1789–1799) followed by the Napoleonic Wars until 1815. These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism. The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795 and 1805 had, in the words of one of their number, Alfred de Vigny, been 'conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums'. According to Jacques Barzun, there were three generations of Romantic artists. The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.

Overview Timeline For most of the Western world, Romanticism was at its peak from approximately 1800 to 1850. The first Romantic ideas arose from an earlier German Counter-Enlightenment movement called Sturm und Drang (German: 'Storm and Stress'). This movement directly criticized the Enlightenment's position that humans can fully comprehend the world through rationality alone, suggesting that intuition and emotion are key components of insight and understanding. Published in 1774, 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe began to shape the Romanticist movement and its ideals. The events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also direct influences on the movement; many early Romantics throughout Europe sympathized with the ideals and achievements of French revolutionaries. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as the glorification of the past and nature, preferring the medieval over the classical. Romanticism was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, and the prevailing ideology of the Age of Enlightenment, especially the scientific rationalization of Nature. The movement's ideals were embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature; it also had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences. Romanticism had a significant and complex effect on politics: Romantic thinking influenced conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and nationalism. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. Margaret Drabble described it in literature as taking place 'roughly between 1770 and 1848', and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, M. H. Abrams placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics. Others have proposed 1780–1830. In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; musical Romanticism, for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the Four Last Songs of Richard Strauss are described stylistically as 'Late Romantic' and were composed in 1946–48. However, in most fields the Romantic period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier. The early period of the Romantic era was a time of war, with the French Revolution (1789–1799) followed by the Napoleonic Wars until 1815. These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism. The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795 and 1805 had, in the words of one of their number, Alfred de Vigny, been 'conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums'. According to Jacques Barzun, there were three generations of Romantic artists. The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.

Explain to a third-grader: when did they start adding zinc to pennies,ETA3G,"""In an effort to thwart a melt off of pennies in 1982, the United States Mint made half of the pennies out of solid copper and the other half out of copper plated zinc.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The cent, the United States of America one-cent coin (symbol: ¢), often called the 'penny', is a unit of currency equaling one one-hundredth of a United States of America dollar. It has been the lowest face-value physical unit of U.S. currency since the abolition of the half-cent in 1857 (the abstract mill, which has never been minted, equal to a tenth of a cent, continues to see limited use in the fields of taxation and finance). The first U.S. cent was produced in 1787, and the cent has been issued primarily as a copper or copper-plated coin throughout its history. Due to inflation, pennies have lost virtually all their purchasing power and are often viewed as an expensive burden to businesses, banks, government (especially mints) and the public in general. The penny is issued in its current form as the Lincoln cent, with its obverse featuring the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909, the centennial of his birth. From 1959 (the sesquicentennial of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial. Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln's 200th birthday and a new, 'permanent' reverse – the Union Shield – was introduced in 2010. The coin is 0.75 inches (19.05 mm) in diameter and 0.0598 inches (1.52 mm) in thickness. The current copper-plated zinc cent issued since 1982 weighs 2.5 grams, while the previous 95% copper cent still found in circulation weighed 3.11 g (see further below). In 1943, at the peak of World War II, zinc-coated steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper. A few copper cents from 1943 were produced from 1942 planchets remaining in the bins. Similarly, some 1944 steel cents have been confirmed. From 1944 to 1946, salvaged ammunition shells made their way into the minting process, and it was not uncommon to see coins featuring streaks of brass or having a considerably darker finish than other issues. During the early 1970s, the price of copper rose to the point where the cent contained almost one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternative metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and over 1.5 million samples of the 1974 aluminum cent were struck before ultimately being rejected. The cent's composition was changed in 1982 because the value of the copper in the coin started to rise above one cent. Some 1982 cents used the 97.5% zinc composition, while others used the 95% copper composition. With the exception of 2009 bicentennial cents minted specifically for collectors, United States cents minted after 1982 have been zinc with copper plating. The bronze and copper cents can be distinguished from the newer zinc cents by dropping the coins on a solid surface, or by flipping them in the air with your thumb. The predominantly zinc coins make a lower-pitched 'clunk' when hitting the surface, and make no sound when flipped in the air; while the copper coins produce a higher-pitched ringing sound. In addition, a full 50-cent roll of pre-1982/3 coins weighs 5.4 oz (150 g) compared to a post-1982–83 roll which weighs 4.4 oz (120 g). Designs The Lincoln cent is the current one-cent coin of the U.S. It was adopted in 1909 (which would have been Lincoln's 100th birthday), replacing the Indian Head cent. Its reverse was changed in 1959 from a wheat-stalks design to a design which includes the Lincoln Memorial (to commemorate Lincoln's sesquicentennial) and was replaced again in 2009 with four new designs to commemorate Lincoln's bicentennial. There are more one-cent coins produced than any other denomination, which makes the Lincoln cent a familiar item. In its lifespan, this coin has weathered both world wars, one of which temporarily changed its composition as part of the war effort. The obverse design is the longest produced for any circulating American coin. History A collection of Lincoln cents from 1941 to 1974. Nearly complete set in a folder. Also features two error coins.

Fortunately, the price of copper dropped and production continued. Unfortunately, the increasing price of copper in the early 1980s forced The United States Mint to change the composition of the penny permanently. This was to prevent a melt off of pennies. It has been the past experience in the United States that when the melt value of a coin exceeds its face value, people will melt the coins in order to sell the raw metal and make a profit. In an effort to thwart a melt off of pennies in 1982, the United States Mint made half of the pennies out of solid copper and the other half out of copper plated zinc. Although it is illegal to melt pennies and sell the raw metal, people still pull the solid copper pennies out of circulation in order to save them for their copper value.

The drawings are from An Essay on Coinage by Samuel Thompson. Although published in Ireland in 1783, the drawings show methods and machinery similar to those at the Mint. Screw presses fitted with a lower and upper die stamped the coin designs. They were operated by one to three men, depending on the size of the press. Smaller screw presses operated by one man were also used as cutting presses. In March of 1793 the Mint delivered its first circulating coins: 11,178 copper cents. Silver coin production started the following year and gold coinage began in 1795. Coining was slow; it's possible that each press could only produce a couple dozen coins per minute. The Mint couldn't produce the quantities of coins needed for circulation. Congress allowed certain foreign coins, in circulation since the colonial days, to continue as legal tender. The Switch to Steam Power </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Copper coins, such as the penny, started as pure copper, but rising copper prices led to changes in composition. In 1857, the Mint added nickel to the copper, but switched to tin and zinc in 1864. For the year 1943, pennies became zinc-coated steel because copper was essential to the war effort during World War II. But the Mint also struck a limited number of copper pennies. In 1962 tin was eliminated, and in 1982 the penny became primarily zinc with only 2.5% copper. Silver coins (half dime, dime, quarter, half dollar, dollar) originally consisted of a fineness of .8924, changing to .900 in 1837. In 1866, the new five-cent coin became the first to eliminate silver with a new composition of copper and nickel. It gained the name 'nickel' from its composition. In 1965, the dime and quarter followed, and in 1971, none of the circulating coins contained silver. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Most of our coins are metal sandwiches. The outside layers are three-quarters copper and one-quarter nickel, and the 'filling' is solid copper. Pennies are made of zinc coated with copper.

America's first one-cent piece, called the 'large cent,' was first struck in 1793, one year after the Mint opened. It was so big that it was hard to use, but it wasn't replaced by a smaller penny until 1857, more than 50 years later. George Washington was our first President – but not the first President on a circulating coin.... In 1909, President Lincoln appeared on a one-cent coin and became the first real person—as well as the first American president—to have his face appear on a regular-issue American coin. We used to trade gold, silver, and copper.... A 1792 law directed American money to be made of gold, silver and copper. Gold was used in the $10, $5, and $2.50 pieces. The dollar, half dollar, quarter, dime, and half dime were composed of silver. The cent and half cent were made of copper. How much was in that first batch?... The Mint produced its first circulating coins—all $111.78 worth of them—in March 1793. That first batch consisted of 11,178 copper cents. Soon after, the Mint began issuing gold and silver coins as well. Which Revolutionary War hero also helped make coins?... Besides being quite the skilled horseman and informant, Paul Revere was a silversmith and a contributor to our nation's coinage. Revere's metals company once supplied the Mint with rolled copper for the production of early cents.

There are more one-cent coins produced than any other denomination, which makes the Lincoln cent a familiar item.

Fortunately, the price of copper dropped and production continued. Unfortunately, the increasing price of copper in the early 1980s forced The United States Mint to change the composition of the penny permanently. This was to prevent a melt off of pennies. It has been the past experience in the United States that when the melt value of a coin exceeds its face value, people will melt the coins in order to sell the raw metal and make a profit. In an effort to thwart a melt off of pennies in 1982, the United States Mint made half of the pennies out of solid copper and the other half out of copper plated zinc. Although it is illegal to melt pennies and sell the raw metal, people still pull the solid copper pennies out of circulation in order to save them for their copper value.

Explain to a third-grader: when did they start adding zinc to pennies,ETA3G,"""In 1943, at the peak of World War II, zinc-coated steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper."" And ""In an effort to thwart a melt off of pennies in 1982, the United States Mint made half of the pennies out of solid copper and the other half out of copper plated zinc.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The cent, the United States of America one-cent coin (symbol: ¢), often called the 'penny', is a unit of currency equaling one one-hundredth of a United States of America dollar. It has been the lowest face-value physical unit of U.S. currency since the abolition of the half-cent in 1857 (the abstract mill, which has never been minted, equal to a tenth of a cent, continues to see limited use in the fields of taxation and finance). The first U.S. cent was produced in 1787, and the cent has been issued primarily as a copper or copper-plated coin throughout its history. Due to inflation, pennies have lost virtually all their purchasing power and are often viewed as an expensive burden to businesses, banks, government (especially mints) and the public in general. The penny is issued in its current form as the Lincoln cent, with its obverse featuring the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909, the centennial of his birth. From 1959 (the sesquicentennial of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial. Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln's 200th birthday and a new, 'permanent' reverse – the Union Shield – was introduced in 2010. The coin is 0.75 inches (19.05 mm) in diameter and 0.0598 inches (1.52 mm) in thickness. The current copper-plated zinc cent issued since 1982 weighs 2.5 grams, while the previous 95% copper cent still found in circulation weighed 3.11 g (see further below). In 1943, at the peak of World War II, zinc-coated steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper. A few copper cents from 1943 were produced from 1942 planchets remaining in the bins. Similarly, some 1944 steel cents have been confirmed. From 1944 to 1946, salvaged ammunition shells made their way into the minting process, and it was not uncommon to see coins featuring streaks of brass or having a considerably darker finish than other issues. During the early 1970s, the price of copper rose to the point where the cent contained almost one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternative metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and over 1.5 million samples of the 1974 aluminum cent were struck before ultimately being rejected. The cent's composition was changed in 1982 because the value of the copper in the coin started to rise above one cent. Some 1982 cents used the 97.5% zinc composition, while others used the 95% copper composition. With the exception of 2009 bicentennial cents minted specifically for collectors, United States cents minted after 1982 have been zinc with copper plating. The bronze and copper cents can be distinguished from the newer zinc cents by dropping the coins on a solid surface, or by flipping them in the air with your thumb. The predominantly zinc coins make a lower-pitched 'clunk' when hitting the surface, and make no sound when flipped in the air; while the copper coins produce a higher-pitched ringing sound. In addition, a full 50-cent roll of pre-1982/3 coins weighs 5.4 oz (150 g) compared to a post-1982–83 roll which weighs 4.4 oz (120 g). Designs The Lincoln cent is the current one-cent coin of the U.S. It was adopted in 1909 (which would have been Lincoln's 100th birthday), replacing the Indian Head cent.

Total body water in healthy adults is about 50–60% (range 45 to 75%) of total body weight; women and the obese typically have a lower percentage than lean men. Extracellular fluid makes up about one-third of body fluid, the remaining two-thirds is intracellular fluid within cells. The main component of the extracellular fluid is the interstitial fluid that surrounds cells. Extracellular fluid is the internal environment of all multicellular animals, and in those animals with a blood circulatory system, a proportion of this fluid is blood plasma.

The remaining small portion of the ECF includes the transcellular fluid (about 2.5%). The ECF can also be seen as having two components – plasma and lymph as a delivery system, and interstitial fluid for water and solute exchange with the cells. The extracellular fluid, in particular the interstitial fluid, constitutes the body's internal environment that bathes all of the cells in the body. The ECF composition is therefore crucial for their normal functions, and is maintained by a number of homeostatic mechanisms involving negative feedback.

But their book became famous as a book of children's stories anyway.[3] The title of the story is properly translated as 'Little Red Cap' even though it is usually known in English as 'Little Red Riding Hood'.[4] In this German picture-book, Red Riding Hood has poured a glass of beer for her Grandmother. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> In these early versions of the story, Red Riding Hood escapes on her own. She uses her own intelligence and her own courage. The Brothers Grimm and other later authors added male heroes who save Red Riding Hood.[5][8] Charles Perrault[change | change source] The story was first written and published in a book from 1697 by the French writer Charles Perrault. The name of the book, in English, is Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals: Tales of Mother Goose. The story is called The Little Red Cap (Le Petit Chaperon Rouge).[9] Perrault's version of the tale is the original printed version, but it is likely based on an older oral tradition. It is uncertain if Perrault knew a folk tale from the south of France about a girl who cleverly escapes a werewolf occupying her grandmother's bed.[10] Perrault wanted to make a strong point about wise and foolish behaviour. He wanted to show that a beautiful young woman was in danger of having men with bad morals try to trick her into wrong behaviour.[5] In Perrault's story the girl is eaten and there is no happy ending.[11] Other versions[change | change source] The story has been changed many times in the centuries following its publication. It is a little different from the way that the Brothers Grimm tell it.[12] In their version, a huntsman slays the child-devouring wolf. He then frees the heroine from the animal's stomach. An English illustration from the 1920s In some modern versions of the story, especially versions for very young children, the grandmother does not die.

Little Red Riding Hood is thought to have originated in the 17th century. According to Hannah Newton, author of The Sick Child in Early Modern England, 1580–1720, in 17th century England, almost one-third of young people died before they were 15 years old. And 'Rather than shielding their offspring from these foreboding facts, parents encouraged their children to think about their own mortality.' (source) Indeed, in tale after tale, death or the possibility of death makes a recurring appearance. Little Red Riding Hood is an instructive tale that warns about threats to one's own mortality. Do not talk to strangers — or you may die. Beware of wolves — or you may die. Similarly, with The Gingerbread Man. Do not unthinkingly place your trust in strangers, even if they appear to be trying to help you — or you may die. Death was a significant and real threat, so many of these stories provided instruction as to how to avoid death. </p>",2025-11-20 15:39:28-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Explain to a third-grader: who wrote the original little red riding hood story,ETA3G,"""The most famous version of the story is the one written by the Brothers Grimm in the 19th century.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Little Red Riding Hood – Adapted from the Brothers Grimm by Gennady Spirin Of all of the versions that I could get my hands on, this one stays truest to the original Grimm version, down to her red cap rather than cloak. Little Red's mother sends her off with the reminder to 'mind your manners and do not leave the path for any reason.' The wolf is larger than life, fancily dressed. and he fiercely attacks Little Red's grandmother. Upon hearing the wolf's loud snores after his grand meal, the hunters manage to save Little Red and her grandmother and Little Red learns to never speak to strangers and always listen to her mother. Little Red Riding Hood – The Brother's Grimm, Illustrated by Bernadette Watts </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The story has varied considerably in different versions over the centuries, translations, and as the subject of numerous modern adaptations. Other names for the story are 'Little Red Cap' or simply 'Red Riding Hood'. It is number 333 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system for folktales. Plot Original version 'Little Red Riding Hood' as illustrated in a 1927 story anthology The story centers around a girl named Little Red Riding Hood, after the red hooded cape that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation). In the Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to several likely pre-17th century versions from various European countries. Some of these are significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by French peasants in the 10th century and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster Egbert of Liège. A fifteenth-century collection of folklore described an anecdote about a woman whose husband was a werewolf though it bares little resemblance to Perrault's text. In Italy, Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century, where a number of versions exist, including La finta nonna (The False Grandmother), written among others by Italo Calvino in the Italian Folktales collection. It has also been called 'The Story of Grandmother'. It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. 'Grandaunt Tiger'). </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Apart from the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual. Some are listed below. Natural cycles Folklorists and cultural anthropologists, such as P. Saintyves and Edward Burnett Tylor, saw 'Little Red Riding Hood' in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles. Her red hood could represent the bright sun which is ultimately swallowed by the terrible night (the wolf), and the variations in which she is cut out of the wolf's belly represent the dawn. In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and Sköll, the wolf in Norse mythology that will swallow the personified Sun at Ragnarök, or Fenrir. Alternatively, the tale could be about the season of spring or the month of May, escaping the winter.

And why they are effectively 'sportswashing' their abysmal human rights records. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The IOC failed to punish Chinese leaders for breaking their empty Olympic promises — and in 2015 awarded Beijing the 2022 Winter Games. Since then, President Xi Jinping's government has arrested journalists, women's rights activists and lawyers; dismantled freedoms in Hong Kong; and committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, including mass detentions, torture, sexual abuse and cultural persecution of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. Crimes against humanity are among the gravest human rights abuses under international law, making the Chinese government the wrong host for an event the IOC claims will 'celebrate humanity.' The IOC has uttered not a word about these abuses. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> After the cauldron was lit by legendary boxer and activist Muhammad Ali, beach volleyball, mountain biking, lightweight rowing and women's football, along with the first women-only sport, softball, made their Olympic debuts.

Unfortunately, this historic Games was marked by tragedy when a terrorist bomb exploded in the Centennial Olympic Park, killing two people and injuring 110 more. 2002 Winter Olympics: Salt Lake City, Utah The most recent Olympics to be held in the United States was in 2002 when Salt Lake City, Utah, hosted the Winter Games. The Salt Lake City Olympics was a historic one for the Black community. American athlete Vonetta Flowers became the first Black athlete to take home a winter gold medal in women's bobsleigh and Canadian ice hockey player Jarome Iginla followed as the first Black male winner. 2028 Summer Olympics: Los Angeles, California </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Another legacy structure from the 2008 Games, the National Aquatics Center is best known for being the venue where Michael Phelps won his record eight gold medals.

After 16 days and 109 events, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics officially ended Sunday with the traditional closing ceremony. A small, but enthusiastic, group of spectators sat in the stands at Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium during the bitterly cold night in the host city. Some did the wave and cheerfully waved the Chinese flag while waiting for the night's festivities to start.

Present-day distribution of marsupials Introduced Native Marsupials are a diverse group of mammals belonging to the infraclass Marsupialia. They are natively found in Australasia, Wallacea, and the Americas. One of the defining features of marsupials is their unique reproductive strategy, where the young are born in a relatively undeveloped state and then nurtured within a pouch on their mother's abdomen. Living marsupials encompass a wide range of species, including kangaroos, koalas, opossums, Tasmanian devils, wombats, wallabies, and bandicoots, among others. Marsupials constitute a clade stemming from the last common ancestor of extant metatherians, which encompasses all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals. This evolutionary split between placentals and marsupials occurred at least 125 million years ago, possibly dating back over 160 million years to the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous period. Presently, close to 70% of the 334 extant species of marsupials are concentrated on the Australian continent, including mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and nearby islands. The remaining 30% are distributed across the Americas, primarily in South America, with thirteen species in Central America and a single species, the Virginia opossum, inhabiting North America north of Mexico. Marsupials range in size from a few grams in the long-tailed planigale, to several tonnes in the extinct Diprotodon. The word marsupial comes from marsupium, the technical term for the abdominal pouch. It, in turn, is borrowed from the Latin marsupium and ultimately from the ancient Greek μάρσιππος mársippos, meaning 'pouch'. Anatomy Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) Marsupials have the typical characteristics of mammals—e.g., mammary glands, three middle ear bones, (and ears that usually have tragi, varying in hearing thresholds) and true hair. There are, however, striking differences as well as a number of anatomical features that separate them from eutherians. Most female marsupials have a front pouch, which contains multiple teats for the sustenance of their young. Marsupials also have other common structural features. Ossified patellae are absent in most modern marsupials (though a small number of exceptions are reported) and epipubic bones are present. Marsupials (and monotremes) also lack a gross communication (corpus callosum) between the right and left brain hemispheres. Skull and teeth Marsupials exhibit distinct cranial features compared to placental mammals. Generally, their skulls are relatively small and compact. Notably, they possess frontal holes known as foramen lacrimale situated at the front of the orbit.

Explain to a third-grader: where was the hindenburg scheduled to fly and how many passengers were on it,ETA3G,"""Filled with hydrogen, it caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> The Hindenburg disaster was an airship accident that occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, U.S. The LZ 129 Hindenburg (Luftschiff Zeppelin #129; Registration: D-LZ 129) was a German commercial passenger-carrying rigid airship, the lead ship of the Hindenburg class, the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume. It was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH) and operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei). It was named after Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who was president of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. Filled with hydrogen, it caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst. The accident caused 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen) among the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), and an additional fatality on the ground. The disaster was the subject of newsreel coverage, photographs and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. A variety of theories have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The publicity shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era. Flight Background The Hindenburg made ten trips to the United States in 1936. After opening its 1937 season by completing a single round-trip passage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in late March, the Hindenburg departed from Frankfurt, Germany, on the evening of May 3, on the first of ten round trips between Europe and the United States that were scheduled for its second year of commercial service. American Airlines had contracted with the operators of the Hindenburg to shuttle passengers from Lakehurst to Newark for connections to airplane flights. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Hindenburg had a duralumin structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads along its length, with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship's outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater's skins. In 1931 the Zeppelin Company purchased 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) of duralumin salvaged from the wreckage of the October 1930 crash of the British airship R101. Dining room Lounge, with the world map painted on the wall Hindenburg's </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Four years after construction began in 1932, Hindenburg made its maiden test flight from the Zeppelin dockyards at Friedrichshafen on March 4, 1936, with 87 passengers and crew aboard. These included the Zeppelin Company chairman, Dr. Hugo Eckener, as commander, former World War I Zeppelin commander Lt. Col. Joachim Breithaupt representing the German Air Ministry, the Zeppelin Company's eight airship captains, 47 other crew members, and 30 dockyard employees who flew as passengers. Harold G. Dick was the only non-Luftschiffbau representative aboard. Although the name Hindenburg had been quietly selected by Eckener over a year earlier, only the airship's formal registration number (D-LZ129) and the five Olympic rings (promoting the 1936 Summer Olympics to be held in Berlin that August) were displayed on the hull during its trial flights. As the airship passed over Munich on its second trial flight the next afternoon, the city's Lord Mayor, Karl Fiehler, asked Eckener by radio the LZ129's name, to which he replied 'Hindenburg'. On March 23, Hindenburg made its first passenger and mail flight, carrying 80 reporters from Friedrichshafen to Löwenthal. The ship flew over Lake Constance with Graf Zeppelin. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> On October 8, 1936, Hindenburg made a 10.5 hour flight (the 'Millionaires Flight') over New England carrying 72 wealthy and influential passengers including financier and future U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winthrop W. Aldrich, his 28-year-old nephew Nelson Rockefeller, who became the Governor of New York and, later, Vice President of the United States, various German and American government officials and military officers, as well as key figures in the aviation industry, including Juan Trippe, founder and Chief Executive of Pan American Airways, and World War I flying ace Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, president of Eastern Airlines. The ship arrived at Boston by noon and returned to Lakehurst at 5:22 pm before making its final transatlantic flight of the season back to Frankfurt. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Hindenburg also had an experimental aircraft hook-on trapeze similar to the one on the U.S. Navy Goodyear–Zeppelin built airships Akron and Macon. This was intended to allow customs officials to be flown out to Hindenburg to process passengers before landing and to retrieve mail from the ship for early delivery. Experimental hook-ons and takeoffs, piloted by Ernst Udet, were attempted on March 11 and April 27, 1937, but were not very successful, owing to turbulence around the hook-up trapeze. The loss of the ship ended all prospects of further testing. Final flight: May 3–6, 1937 Main article: Hindenburg disaster After making the first South American flight of the 1937 season in late March, Hindenburg left Frankfurt for Lakehurst on the evening of 3 May, on its first scheduled round trip between Europe and North America that season. Although strong headwinds slowed the crossing, the flight had otherwise proceeded routinely as it approached for a landing three days later. Hindenburg's arrival on 6 May was delayed for several hours to avoid a line of thunderstorms passing over Lakehurst, but around 7:00 pm the airship was cleared for its final approach to the Naval Air Station, which it made at an altitude of 200 m (660 ft) with Captain Max Pruss in command. At 7:21 pm a pair of landing lines were dropped from the nose of the ship and were grabbed hold of by ground handlers. Four minutes later, at 7:25 pm Hindenburg burst into flames and dropped to the ground in a little over half a minute. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crew aboard, 13 passengers and 22 crew died, as well as one member of the ground crew, a total of 36 lives lost. Herbert Morrison's commentary of the incident became a classic of audio history. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> On May 6, 1937, the rigid German airship Hindenburg arrived at its Lakehurst, NJ, Naval Air Station destination after departing Frankfurt, Germany 3 days earlier. A crowded landing field of newspaper and radio journalists, film and still camera people, family, friends, and ground crew waited for the airship despite arriving hours behind schedule. As the Hindenburg prepared to dock with its mooring mast, it suddenly burst into flames forcing passengers and crew to jump from windows to escape the inferno. In seconds, the airship was completely destroyed and 36 people were dead. The disaster was immortalized as the first major aviation accident captured by photographs, sound recordings, and motion picture film. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH built the rigid passenger airship Hindenburg (LZ129) between 1931 and 1936 at its facility in Friedrichshafen, Germany.

It was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH) and operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei). It was named after Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who was president of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. Filled with hydrogen, it caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst. The accident caused 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen) among the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), and an additional fatality on the ground. The disaster was the subject of newsreel coverage, photographs and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. A variety of theories have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The publicity shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era. Flight Background The Hindenburg made ten trips to the United States in 1936. After opening its 1937 season by completing a single round-trip passage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in late March, the Hindenburg departed from Frankfurt, Germany, on the evening of May 3, on the first of ten round trips between Europe and the United States that were scheduled for its second year of commercial service. American Airlines had contracted with the operators of the Hindenburg to shuttle passengers from Lakehurst to Newark for connections to airplane flights. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Hindenburg had a duralumin structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads along its length, with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship's outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater's skins. In 1931 the Zeppelin Company purchased 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) of duralumin salvaged from the wreckage of the October 1930 crash of the British airship R101.

These included the Zeppelin Company chairman, Dr. Hugo Eckener, as commander, former World War I Zeppelin commander Lt. Col. Joachim Breithaupt representing the German Air Ministry, the Zeppelin Company's eight airship captains, 47 other crew members, and 30 dockyard employees who flew as passengers. Harold G.

Although the name Hindenburg had been quietly selected by Eckener over a year earlier, only the airship's formal registration number (D-LZ129) and the five Olympic rings (promoting the 1936 Summer Olympics to be held in Berlin that August) were displayed on the hull during its trial flights. As the airship passed over Munich on its second trial flight the next afternoon, the city's Lord Mayor, Karl Fiehler, asked Eckener by radio the LZ129's name, to which he replied 'Hindenburg'.

This was intended to allow customs officials to be flown out to Hindenburg to process passengers before landing and to retrieve mail from the ship for early delivery. Experimental hook-ons and takeoffs, piloted by Ernst Udet, were attempted on March 11 and April 27, 1937, but were not very successful, owing to turbulence around the hook-up trapeze. The loss of the ship ended all prospects of further testing. Final flight: May 3–6, 1937 Main article: Hindenburg disaster After making the first South American flight of the 1937 season in late March, Hindenburg left Frankfurt for Lakehurst on the evening of 3 May, on its first scheduled round trip between Europe and North America that season. Although strong headwinds slowed the crossing, the flight had otherwise proceeded routinely as it approached for a landing three days later. Hindenburg's arrival on 6 May was delayed for several hours to avoid a line of thunderstorms passing over Lakehurst, but around 7:00 pm the airship was cleared for its final approach to the Naval Air Station, which it made at an altitude of 200 m (660 ft) with Captain Max Pruss in command. At 7:21 pm a pair of landing lines were dropped from the nose of the ship and were grabbed hold of by ground handlers. Four minutes later, at 7:25 pm Hindenburg burst into flames and dropped to the ground in a little over half a minute.

Though the finale shifted from the battlefield, the events were, if anything, far more seismic, with game-changing revelations and huge moves from every corner of the realm that established some very clear new conflicts going into season 7. Just look at all that happened in those 69 minutes: Dany set sail for Westeros, Dorne joined forces with both Dany and the Tyrells, Arya returned to Westeros and crossed a major name off her list, Jon became King in the North, and Cersei blew up her enemies and then claimed the Iron Throne for herself.

This is actually pretty cool and suitably epic, though I do wonder how the Dothraki suddenly all look like expert sailors. Also, I didn't notice it the first time I watched because I was wondering how Varys teleported back so quickly, but some of the ships have the Dornish sun on their sails, so it's not just Varys who got back inexplicably quickly; it's a whole fleet of ships that teleported in. The dragons still look cool, and I guess we're in for a bunch of epic battles going forward with a pared down cast and basically nothing left for the show to do but have all-out war. The real question, though, is how are they going to squeeze in more brothel scenes now? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Miscellaneous Thoughts That fabric on Margaery's dress is incredible.

This is actually pretty cool and suitably epic, though I do wonder how the Dothraki suddenly all look like expert sailors. Also, I didn't notice it the first time I watched because I was wondering how Varys teleported back so quickly, but some of the ships have the Dornish sun on their sails, so it's not just Varys who got back inexplicably quickly; it's a whole fleet of ships that teleported in. The dragons still look cool, and I guess we're in for a bunch of epic battles going forward with a pared down cast and basically nothing left for the show to do but have all-out war. The real question, though, is how are they going to squeeze in more brothel scenes now? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Miscellaneous Thoughts That fabric on Margaery's dress is incredible. I love how Pycelle actually tries to fight those kids off, so we got to see an old dude punch a couple of little kids in the face. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> For a show that boasts some of the best music on television, somehow Game of Thrones managed to up the ante even more in the Season 6 finale. Right from the first scene, and right up until the last, just about every bit was simply gorgeous. An almost mournful piano greets us in the High Sept. Later, during Cersei's coronation, the urgent rise and fall of strings, dark and moody. The episode deserves awards based on its music alone. Update: Here's that opening piano number. Feast your ears! Of course, it was during the trial of Loras Tyrell that I first noticed just how striking the score was, so we'll follow our ears, through the city streets and up the steps, pitter patter, to the High Sept. We'll begin in...

Explain to a third-grader: the removal of temperature in fire fighting method is known as,ETA3G,"""Using water is one common method to extinguish a fire""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Hot zones, which can be detected with a gloved hand, for example by touching a door before opening it; Soot on windows, which usually means that combustion is incomplete, and thus, a lack of air in the room; Smoke pulsing in and out around a door frame, as if the fire were breathing, which usually also means a lack of air to support combustion. Spraying water on the ceiling in short pulses of a diffused spray (e.g., a cone with an opening angle of 60°) can be undertaken to test the heat of smoke: If the temperature is moderate, the water falls down in drops with a sound like rain; if the temperature is high, the water vaporizes with a hiss—the sign of a potentially extremely dangerous impending flashover. Ideally, part of reconnaissance is consulting a plan for the building that provides information about structures, firefighter hazards, and in some cases the most appropriate strategies and tactics for fighting a fire in that context. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Using water is one common method to extinguish a fire. Water extinguishes a fire by cooling, which removes heat because of water's ability to absorb massive amounts of heat as it converts to water vapor. Without heat, the fuel cannot keep the oxidizer from reducing the fuel in order to sustain the fire. Water also extinguishes a fire by smothering it. When water is heated to its boiling point, it converts to water vapor. When this conversion takes place, it dilutes the oxygen in the air above the fire, thus removing one of the elements that the fire requires to burn. This can also be done with foam. Another way to extinguish a fire is fuel removal. This can be accomplished by stopping the flow of liquid or gaseous fuel, by removing solid fuel in the path of a fire, or by allowing the fire to burn until all the fuel is consumed, at which point the fire will self-extinguish. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> One common way to extinguish a fire is to spray it with water. The water has two roles: It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire, and this vapor displaces the oxygen (the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water, at 1,000 °F (538 °C) it expands over 4,000 times). This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent, and it dies out. The vaporization of water also absorbs heat; it thereby cools the smoke, air, walls, and objects that could act as further fuel, and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow, which is by 'jumping' to nearby heat/fuel sources to start new fires, which then combine. Water extinguishment is thus a combination of 'asphyxia' (cutting off the oxygen supply) and cooling. The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia, but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area. For outdoor fires, the seat of the fire is sprayed with a straight spray: the cooling effect immediately follows the 'asphyxia' caused by vaporization and reduces the further amount of water required. This is because water droplets, upon forming in to water mist, increase their surface area by a large magnitude, greatly increasing the endothermic cooling effect and robbing the fire of oxygen. A straight spray is used so the water arrives massively to the seat of the fire before it vaporizes. A strong spray may also have a mechanical effect; it can disperse the combustible product and thus prevent the fire from starting again. Spray is always aimed at a surface or an object. For this reason, the strategy is sometimes called a two-dimensional or 2D attack. Until the 1970s, fires were usually attacked while they declined, using the same strategy as for open air fires. Now fires are attacked in their development phase because firefighters arrive sooner at the site of a fire and because of changes in building construction. The increasing use of thermal insulation confines the heat, and modern materials, especially polymers, produce much more heat than do traditional materials like wood, plaster, stone, and bricks. Under these conditions, there is a greater risk of backdraft and flashover. Directly spraying the seat of the fire in enclosed areas can have unfortunate consequences: the force of water pushes air in front of it, which supplies the fire with extra oxygen before the water. The most important issue is not combating the flames, but controlling the fire; for example, cooling the smoke so that it cannot spread and start fires further away, and endanger the lives of people, including the firefighters. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> cools the smoke which is then less likely to start a fire when it moves away. As gas cools it becomes denser (Charles's law); thus, it also reduces the mobility of the smoke and avoids a 'backfire' of water vapor. Also, the diffuse spray creates an inert 'water vapor sky', which prevents 'roll-over' (rolls of flames on the ceiling created by hot burning gases). Only short pulses of water need to be sprayed, otherwise the spraying modifies the equilibrium, and the gases mix instead of remaining stratified: the hot gases (initially at the ceiling) move around the room, and the temperature rises at the ground, which is dangerous for firefighters. An alternative is to cool all the atmosphere by spraying the whole atmosphere as if drawing letters in the air ('penciling'). </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> In such cases, it is necessary to asphyxiate the fire. This can be done in a variety of ways. Chemical products which react with the fuel can be used to stop the combustion. A layer of water-based fire retardant foam can be applied by the fire hose in order to separate the oxygen in the air from the fuel. carbon dioxide, halon, or sodium bicarbonate can be used. In the case of very small fires and in the absence of other extinguishing agents, covering the flame with a fire blanket can eliminate oxygen flow to the fire. A simple and usually effective way to put out a fire in a stove-top pan is to put a lid on the pan and leave it there. Tactical ventilation or isolation of the fire One of the main risks of a fire is the smoke; because, it carries heat and poisonous gases, and obscures vision. In the case of a fire in a closed location (building), the following two different strategies may be used: isolation of the fire or ventilation. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> A carbon dioxide extinguisher or a fire blanket can be used to remove oxygen from the area around the fire. The carbon dioxide extinguisher pulls oxygen away from the fire and replaces it with non-flammable, denser-than-air carbon dioxide. Fire blankets create a barrier around the fire to keep it from getting extra oxygen. Another method of drawing away oxygen would be closing doors during an evacuation of a building. This stops a new supply of oxygen from entering. Heat Heat automatically comes to mind when you think about fire. One of the best ways to weaken and ultimately put out a fire is to reduce its heat. A good example of this would be to blow out the flame of a candle. The candle stops burning when the heat is removed from it by the swiftly moving air. Heat not only increases the likelihood that a fire will start but also helps keep one going by eliminating moisture from fuel sources and warming the surroundings, making it easier for the fire to spread. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> Cooling with water is one of the most typical ways of putting out a fire. The fuel is cooled until it produces insufficient vapor to ignite. The drop in temperature is achieved by applying enough water to create a negative heat balance. Burning will stop if the rate at which heat is produced by combustion is lower than the rate at which heat is lost from the burning substance. The fire may eventually go out if the pace at which heat is lost from it exceeds the rate at which heat is produced. Due to its high thermal capacity, water is an effective cooling agent. This makes it the fire extinguishing chemical that is by far the most extensively used, and it is readily available in enormous amounts. Starving In certain instances, putting out a fire only requires removing the fuel source. There are several ways to do this, including stopping the flow of liquid, removing solid fuel from the fire's path, or letting the fire burn until all the fuel is gone. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Stopping combustion requires depriving the fire of one or more sides of the fire triangle, or by stopping the chemical chain reaction that sustains combustion—and that's how standard fire extinguishing work. It's important to use the right type of agent to extinguish the fire, so we have created an overview of how the most common types of agents work to disrupt the fire triangle/tetrahedron. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and inert gases put out Class B and C fires by removing oxygen from the fire triangle. While inert gases will also put out Class A fires, CO2 can be used for surface Class A fires only. Water-based systems put out Class A fires by removing heat from the fire triangle. Dry powders are available in a few different types, with different applications appropriate for Class A, B, or C fires, work by applying a thin layer of material to separate the fuel from surrounding oxygen, interrupting the chemical chain reaction that keeps a fire going. </p>",2025-11-20 15:44:17-08:00,False,Response is valid.

(2014-present)Websitebeatsbydre.com Beats Electronics LLC (also known as Beats by Dr. Dre, or simply Beats by Dre) is an American consumer audio products manufacturer headquartered in Culver City, California. The company was founded in 2006 by music producer Dr. Dre and record company executive Jimmy Iovine. Since 2014, it has been an Apple subsidiary. The subsidiary's product line is primarily focused on headphones and speakers. The company's original product line was manufactured in partnership with the AV equipment company Monster Cable Products. Following the end of its contract with the company, Beats took further development of its products in-house. In 2014, the company expanded into the online music market with the launch of a subscription-based streaming service, Beats Music. In 2011, NPD Group reported that Beats' market share was 64% in the U.S. for headphones priced higher than $100, and the brand was valued at $1 billion in September 2013. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Beats was established in 2006 by music producer Dr. Dre and record company executive Jimmy Iovine.[citation needed] Iovine perceived two key problems in the music industry: the impact of piracy on music sales and the substandard audio quality provided by Apple's plastic earbuds. Iovine recalled that Dre said to him: 'Man, it's one thing that people steal my music. It's another thing to destroy the feeling of what I've worked on.' Iovine sought the opinions of musicians with 'great taste', such as M.I.A., Pharrell Williams, will.i.am, and Gwen Stefani during the early developmental stage. Beats initially partnered with inventor Noel Lee and his company Monster Cable, an audio and video component manufacturer based in Brisbane, California, to manufacture and develop the first Beats-branded products, and debuted its first product, Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones, on July 25, 2008. Jimmy Iovine and David Guetta </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> In October 2012, Beats unveiled its first two self-developed products, 'Beats Executive' headphones and 'Beats Pill' wireless speakers—Iovine believed that the company would now have to 'control [its] own destiny' in order to continue its growth. Iovine also commented on how other headphone makers had attempted to emulate Beats' celebrity endorsement business model (including Monster themselves, who unveiled Earth, Wind and Fire and Miles Davis-themed headphones at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show), stating that 'some of our competitors are cheap engineers who have never been to a recording studio. You can't just stick someone's name on a headphone that doesn't know anything about sound.' Following the decision to transform Beats into an autonomous entity, the company's revenues reached the $1 billion mark, according to Iovine. HTC sale and Beats Music Logo for Beats Music </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Changing the way we listen to music, then and now. Beats headphones: A sonic revolution In 2006, famed hip-hop producer Dr. Dre felt listening audiences all deserved the same high-quality sound that he experienced  in the studio. So he partnered with industry mogul Jimmy Iovine to create Beats by Dre. Their goal was simple: create headphones that help people hear all the music. Achieving their goal meant creating electronics that could bring the experience and emotion of hearing music in a professional recording studio to the headphones used by everyday music fans. And it worked. Just as Dre imagined,  Beats Electronics has become known for its unparalleled audio quality, as well as its supreme style. In 2014, Apple acquired the brand, elevating Beats' tech capabilities even further. Over the years Beats has evolved and expanded its product line to cater to the diverse needs of many listening audiences. Here's a wrap-up of Beats' sonic journey. Beats by Dr. Dre Studio: Redefining audio luxury. July 2008—Beats headphones took the world by storm with the release of Beats by Dr. Dre Studio, the company's first product. These over-ear headphones offered a blend of bass and precision that set a benchmark for audio quality. The headphones quickly became known for their comfort and noise isolation. Updated versions of these original Beats headphones are available through Verizon and include Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones and Beats Studio3 Wireless Over-Ear Headphones. Beats by Dr. Dre Executive: Elevated sophistication. October 2012—Building on the success of its inaugural line, Beats introduced the Executive headphones. These wireless Beats headphones catered more to music professionals and discerning audiophiles. With their sleek aluminum design, noise-canceling technology and impressive battery life, they became the go-to choice for those who demanded both performance and style. Beats Pill: A portable speaker in a capsule. October 2012—The Beats Pill was the brand's first, non-headset-related product release. This sleek, easily transportable speaker had a capsule-based design with a curved appearance and used Bluetooth to connect to other devices.

In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 33 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017. In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS, while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004. Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (42), a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored. Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by the Guinness World Records. Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions. As of March 2023,[update] Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million. After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by 'mutual agreement'. On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as 'La Décima' (Spanish: 'The Tenth,' [la ˈðeθima]). Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals. After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, 'If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, 'We must start again from zero.' After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season. In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals. Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012. Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals, several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015. Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as 'La Duodécima'. The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season. Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season. On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy. In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's 'need for change' as his rationale for departing. Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history, and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage. Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Real Madrid has had the most success in the European Cup, winning the trophy for a record fifteen times. Real was the winner of the inaugural edition of the tournament and remains the only club to win the trophy five times in a row (the first five editions).

Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season. On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy. In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's 'need for change' as his rationale for departing. Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history, and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage. Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Real Madrid has had the most success in the European Cup, winning the trophy for a record fifteen times.

Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by the Guinness World Records. Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions. As of March 2023,[update] Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million. After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by 'mutual agreement'. On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as 'La Décima' (Spanish: 'The Tenth,' [la ˈðeθima]). Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals. After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, 'If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, 'We must start again from zero.' After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season. In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals. Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012. Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals, several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015. Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as 'La Duodécima'. The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season. Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.

It takes place in a different universe as the original title, and centers around Amalie, a member of an anti-witch organization, who secretly enlists the help of Chelka - a witch inhabiting the body of her younger sister Milm - to uncover a conspiracy within the organization and save the world of Kevala from disaster, with the assistance of the mysterious Hundred Knight. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the art and music, but criticized the game's story and characters, repetitive combat, and lack of innovation compared to its predecessor. Gameplay The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 is an action role-playing game with a top-down isometric view. Players fight their way through a variety of levels as Hundred Knight, a magical creature that can be equipped with five types of weapons: swords, hammers, staffs, lances, and spears. Each weapon type differs in attack range, speed, and motion. By changing the order of use, players create many different combos. Plot The world of Kevala is corrupted by the Witch Disease, an illness developed in children under age 10. Its cause is unknown. A third eye appears on the forehead of those infected with the Witch Disease, and when the eye opens they awaken as a witch. A girl named Amalie lives in a remote village after she lost her parents to a witch. Her younger sister Milm is the only family she has left. One day, Milm suddenly disappears and Amalie eagerly searches for her. When she is about to give up, Milm shows up again, covered in mud and with the witch's eye on her forehead. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 was first revealed in May 2015 through a short video in which Nippon Ichi Software confirmed that the game was in development. In October 2016, director Kenta Asano told Dengeki PlayStation that the PlayStation 4 was chosen as platform for the game because The Witch and the Hundred Knight Revival, an enhanced port of the original game for the system, was well received. A Winter 2017 release was announced at the same time. Later that month, the February 23 release date was revealed. The game was released in North America and Europe in March 2018. Reception ReceptionAggregate scoreAggregatorScoreMetacritic61/100Review scoresPublicationScoreEurogamer6/10Famitsu33/40IGN6.3/10RPGFan45/100 The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 received a 33/40 score in issue 1472 of Famitsu upon its Japanese release. Commercially, the game was not as successful in Japan as its predecessor. According to Media Create, only 13,421 physical copies of the game were sold during the week of release, compared to 49,209 copies in the week of launch of the first game for PlayStation 3 in 2013. The game saw similar mixed reviews to its predecessor upon its Western release, with an aggregate score of 61 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 24 reviews. Antonio Savino of Eurogamer Italia rated the game 6/10, saying that while the gameplay and customization were 'engaging', the narration style combined with the game's repetitive levels makes the game 'too boring' and 'not very satisfying'. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 is a game that does function well, and some people who enjoy NIS America's line of antihero-led adventures may find themselves enjoying it. There are certainly some interesting systems in place, as Battle Tochkas, Facets and the Third Eye can make some of the more challenging boss battles or fights against large groups feel like skillful altercations. I also found myself really liking both Hundred Knight and Amalie. The problem is, it is not good at incentivizing gameplay. I should want to like and save Milm, but I can not due to Chelka's appearance and Milm's paper doll personality. The loot was not enough to make grinding attactive, and the world does not feel worth exploring.

A girl named Amalie lives in a small village and in a state of panic is searching for her younger sister named Milm who has disappeared. Milm shows up with clear signs of catching the Witch's disease and Amalie and Milm are both exiled from the Village and Amalie is in a desperate state to save her younger sister. Soon after the initial opening of the game you take control of the Hundred Knight and begin your adventure while becoming familiar with the game by doing some short tutorials. These are pretty short and simple and by the end I had pretty much become accustomed to the controls; there is also little difference to the first game so if you have experience with the original then the controls will likely be second nature. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 seems to be Nippon Ichi Software's (NIS) version of Diablo if Diablo was created by a Japanese company. Since it's release in Asia around a year ago, I've been waiting for this to come to us here in the West as I'm a massive fan of NIS and the whole top-down action-RPG style. Truth be told, I have the original game but I never found time to complete it so I really wanted to see how this game stacks up against the original and see what new mechanics it brings. Now, thanks to NIS America, I get to play an interesting story, a unique yet slightly clunky combat system and some of the funniest cutscenes I've seen in a while. The story is pretty good with a lot of comedic moments! The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 is the story of two sisters, Amalie and Milm. One day Milm, the youngest of the sisters, goes out into the forest on her own in order to search for a mana flower, as she loves them and wanted to get one of her own. Upon returning, many hours later, her sister Amalie discovers that Milm has the mark of the witch upon her forehead. This mark appears to be a slanted slice right into her scalp! Behind said gash lies a third eye – the eye of a witch, which once opened grants the powers and abilities of an evil witch-being to the owner. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 is so Japanese – it mixes the Diablo format of combat and loot-gathering with many Visual Novel style NPC interactions throughout the game. The combat portion of the game is really smooth and fluent, with the opportunity for many different combos and alternative attacks. As the game has RPG elements within it as well, as you progress through the game, you will obtain skill points that you can use to unlock and upgrade new abilities. These abilities can be mapped to various button combinations on the controller and swapped around whenever you return back to the base. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 puts you in the shoes of the Hundred Knight, a strange little creature who is brought to life by the Witch Chelka. Chelka has taken over the body of a young girl named Milm, who just so happens to be the younger sister of a girl named Amelie – a Witch hunter. Naturally, chaos ensues which sees the characters head out on a journey full of twists and turns as they look to rid Milm of the Witch's presence. The story plays a pivotal role throughout, and there are a heck of a lot of conversations to get through. It's entertaining enough and certainly embraces its silly side (what would you expect from NIS America?), though it can be a little bit guilty of dragging on at times. At least there're some great visuals on display throughout these cutscenes and there's some good voice work on show too, so those who like getting invested into a quirky little tale will be pleased with what's on offer. </p>",2025-11-20 21:48:24-08:00,False,Response is valid.
Explain to a third-grader: what information is displayed in clear text from the ftp header,ETA3G,"""FTP login uses normal username and password scheme for granting access""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> (HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a completed operation. Curl writes all cookies from its in-memory cookie storage to the given file at the end of operations. Even if no cookies are known, a file is created so that it removes any formerly existing cookies from the file. The file uses the Netscape cookie file format. If you set the filename to a single minus, '-', the cookies are written to stdout. The file specified with -c, --cookie-jar is only used for output. No cookies are read from the file. To read cookies, use the -b, --cookie option. Both options can specify the same file. This command line option activates the cookie engine that makes curl record and use cookies. The -b, --cookie option also activates it. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Specifies which DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server to use to resolve hostnames, instead of using the default name resolver mechanism. The URL must be HTTPS. Some SSL options that you set for your transfer also applies to DoH since the name lookups take place over SSL. However, the certificate verification settings are not inherited but are controlled separately via --doh-insecure and --doh-cert-status. This option is unset if an empty string '' is used as the URL. (Added in 7.85.0) If --doh-url is provided several times, the last set value is used. Example: curl --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com See also --doh-insecure. Added in 7.62.0. -D, --dump-header &lt;filename&gt; (HTTP FTP) Write the received protocol headers to the specified file. If no headers are received, the use of this option creates an empty file. When used in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered being 'headers' and thus are saved there. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> (HTTP) Use an alternative target (path) instead of using the path as provided in the URL. Particularly useful when wanting to issue HTTP requests without leading slash or other data that does not follow the regular URL pattern, like 'OPTIONS *'. curl passes on the verbatim string you give it its the request without any filter or other safe guards. That includes white space and control characters. If --request-target is provided several times, the last set value is used. Example: curl --request-target '*' -X OPTIONS https://example.com See also -X, --request. Added in 7.55.0. --resolve &lt;[+]host:port:addr[,addr]...&gt; </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Output HTTP headers from the most recent request by using %header{name} where name is the case insensitive name of the header (without the trailing colon). The header contents are exactly as sent over the network, with leading and trailing whitespace trimmed (added in 7.84.0). Select a specific target destination file to write the output to, by using %output{name} (added in curl 8.3.0) where name is the full filename. The output following that instruction is then written to that file. More than one %output{} instruction can be specified in the same write-out argument. If the filename cannot be created, curl leaves the output destination to the one used prior to the %output{} instruction. Use %output{&gt;&gt;name} to append data to an existing file. This output is done independently of if the file transfer was successful or not. If the specified action or output specified with this option fails in any way, it does not make curl return a (different) error. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> more... vte The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a plain-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The first FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems. Many dedicated FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been incorporated into productivity applications such as HTML editors and file managers. An FTP client used to be commonly integrated in web browsers, where file servers are browsed with the URI prefix 'ftp://'. In 2021, FTP support was dropped by Google Chrome and Firefox, two major web browser vendors, due to it being superseded by the more secure SFTP and FTPS; although neither of them have implemented the newer protocols. History of FTP servers </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> FTP may run in active or passive mode, which determines how the data connection is established. (This sense of 'mode' is different from that of the MODE command in the FTP protocol.) In active mode, the client starts listening for incoming data connections from the server on port M. It sends the FTP command PORT M to inform the server on which port it is listening. The server then initiates a data channel to the client from its port 20, the FTP server data port. In situations where the client is behind a firewall and unable to accept incoming TCP connections, passive mode may be used. In this mode, the client uses the control connection to send a PASV command to the server and then receives a server IP address and server port number from the server, which the client then uses to open a data connection from an arbitrary client port to the server IP address and server port number received. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> FTP login uses normal username and password scheme for granting access. The username is sent to the server using the USER command, and the password is sent using the PASS command. This sequence is unencrypted 'on the wire', so may be vulnerable to a network sniffing attack. If the information provided by the client is accepted by the server, the server will send a greeting to the client and the session will commence. If the server supports it, users may log in without providing login credentials, but the same server may authorize only limited access for such sessions. Anonymous FTP </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> For a long time, most common web browsers were able to retrieve files hosted on FTP servers, although not all of them had support for protocol extensions such as FTPS. When an FTP—rather than an HTTP—URL is supplied, the accessible contents on the remote server are presented in a manner that is similar to that used for other web content. Google Chrome removed FTP support entirely in Chrome 88, also affecting other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge. Firefox 88 disabled FTP support by default, with Firefox 90 dropping support entirely. FireFTP is a discontinued browser extension that was designed as a full-featured FTP client to be run within Firefox, but when Firefox dropped support for FTP the extension developer recommended using Waterfox. Some browsers, such as the text-based Lynx, still support FTP. Syntax FTP URL syntax is described in RFC 1738, taking the form: ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/[url-path] (the bracketed parts are optional). For example, the URL ftp://public.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt represents the file myfile.txt from the directory mydirectory on the server public.ftp-servers.example.com as an FTP resource. The URL ftp://user001:secretpassword@private.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt adds a specification of the username and password that must be used to access this resource. More details on specifying a username and password may be found in the browsers' documentation (e.g., Firefox and Internet Explorer). By default, most web browsers use passive (PASV) mode, which more easily traverses end-user firewalls. Some variation has existed in how different browsers treat path resolution in cases where there is a non-root home directory for a user.

When I listened to this gospel-pop classic for the first time in absolute yonks, I was dragged off on a wave of nostalgia. I struggled to make any notes. It was the biggest Proustian rush I've experienced yet, as we delve further into the chart-toppers of my childhood. I Wanna Be the Only One, by Eternal ft. BeBe Winans (their 1st and only #1s) 1 week, from 25th May – 1st June 1997 </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Eternal were probably the biggest British girl group in the first half of the 1990s. The only British girl group of the time, really, until the Spice Girls came along and opened the floodgates for the final years of the decade. They were a sort of British answer to En Vogue, two sisters and two others. Louise Nurding had left in 1995 to start a middling solo career, and to become one of the original WAGs by marrying Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp. This was their 11th Top 10 hit since 1993, and they would only have one more before splitting in 1999. Fair to say, although they had some good pop singles, they peaked with this – a fitting record to become their only chart-topper. 'I Wanna Be the Only One' was the 2nd most played song on British radio for the year, meaning that plenty of people surely got sick of it. One of my key memories of the record is hearing it in a car park while eating an ice-cream, presumably sometime in May or June 1997, just at the moment I was getting interested in the charts (I believe that this was Track 1 on 'Now 37'). Soon after that I would start faithfully writing the Top 40 down every week, trying to keep up with the live radio countdown in those pre-internet days. It's not an exaggeration to say that if it hadn't been for songs like this grabbing my attention at that formative age, I might not be writing this blog now.

Eternal bounced mildly around the Top 5 for a few years, making records I remember a great deal less well or fondly than 'My Lovin'' or 'Free Your Mind'. When Louise Nurding left the group to strike out solo, she did exactly the same. So 'I Wanna Be The Only One' at Number One felt like a reward for patient service, in line with the BRIT Awards Nominations Eternal kept racking up. But for once the public get a group right: this is Eternal's most likeable moment, with collaboration bringing out the best in them. I can't bluff and pretend I know anything about the history of gospel in the 80s and 90s, but clearly the Winans family are a major force in it, and BeBe Winans came to this record with a dozen years' experience duetting with his sister – mixing it up with female voices is his speciality, and his interplay with the group here is terrific. 'I Wanna Be The Only One' is purring along before he gets there – the first verse setting up the shape of the song, with a solo voice cradled by those soft 'yeah yeah yeah yeah' backing pulses. But Winans wakes everyone up, sidling into the song like a televangelist – 'Now you deserve a mansion / You can have the best in life' – and as soon as he arrives Eternal relax and start to enjoy themselves. Winans' presence makes the song a nonsense as a narrative – who's meant to be soothing who anymore? Where's this pain that's being erased? (BeBe Winans certainly doesn't have an ounce of it). But that's fine – his swaggering entrance is just a signal to appreciate the song as pure collaboration, to enjoy the heaped key changes, the vamps, the ecstatic group pile-on at the end. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Eternal feat.

The Paraguay's drainage basin, about 1,095,000 square kilometres (423,000 sq mi), covers a vast area that includes major portions of Argentina, southern Brazil, parts of Bolivia, and most of the country of Paraguay. Unlike many of the other great rivers of the Rio de la Plata Basin, the Paraguay has not been dammed for hydroelectric power generation; for this reason it is navigable for a considerable distance, second only to the Amazon River in terms of navigable length on the continent. This makes it an important shipping and trade corridor, providing a much-needed link to the Atlantic Ocean for the otherwise landlocked nations of Paraguay and Bolivia. It serves such important cities as Asunción and Concepción in Paraguay and Formosa in Argentina. The river is also a source of commerce in the form of fishing, and provides irrigation for agriculture along its route. As such it provides a way of life for a number of poor fishermen who live along its banks and make the majority of their income selling fish in local markets, as well as supplying a major source of sustenance for their families. This has created issues in large cities such as Asunción, where poverty-stricken farmers from the country's interior have populated the river's banks in search of an easier lifestyle. Seasonal flooding of the river's banks sometimes forces many thousands of displaced residents to seek temporary shelter until the waters recede from their homes. The Paraguayan military has been forced to dedicate land on one of its reserves in the capital to emergency housing for these displaced citizens. The river is a tourist attraction for its beauty. History The original inhabitants of the upper Paraguay River were the Guarani peoples. The Paraguay River was explored in the 16th century by Sebastian Cabot, who at that time became the first recorded European to discover both the Paraná and Paraguay rivers.

It was elected by the 'Provincial Assembly'. Following India's independence from the British rule in 1947, its members served as the nation's first Parliament as the 'Provisional Parliament of India'. It was conceived and created by V. K. Krishna Menon, who first outlined its necessity in 1933 and enshrined it as a Congress demand. The Indian National Congress held its session at Lucknow in April 1936 presided by Jawaharlal Nehru. The official demand for Constituent Assembly was raised and Government of India Act, 1935 was rejected as it imposed the Constitution which was against the will of the Indians. C. Rajagopalachari voiced the demand for a Constituent Assembly on 15 November 1939 based on adult franchise, and was accepted by the British in August 1940. On 8 August 1940, a statement was made by Viceroy Lord Linlithgow about the expansion of the Governor-General's Executive Council and the establishment of a War Advisory Council. This offer, known as the August Offer, included giving full weight to minority opinions and allowing Indians to draft their own constitution. Under the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, elections were held for the first time for the Constituent Assembly. The Constitution of India was drafted by the Constituent Assembly, and it was implemented under the Cabinet Mission Plan on 16 May 1946. The members of the Constituent Assembly were elected by the provincial assemblies by a single, transferable-vote system of proportional representation. The total membership of the Constituent Assembly was 389 of which 292 were representatives of the provinces, 93 represented the princely states and four were from the chief commissioner provinces of Delhi, Ajmer-Merwara, Coorg and British Baluchistan. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> As a result of the partition, under the Mountbatten plan, a separate Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was established on 3 June 1947.

Adapted for NBC by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons, the show depicts the everyday work lives of office employees at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, and aired from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, with a total of nine seasons consisting of 201 episodes. The show was co-produced by Daniels' Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions (later Shine America), in association with Universal Television. The original executive producers were Daniels, Gervais, Merchant, Howard Klein and Ben Silverman, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The Office received moderately positive reviews from critics (except for the pilot episode which received mixed reviews) during its short first season, but the following seasons, particularly Carell's performance, received significant acclaim from television critics as the show's characters, content, structure, and tone diverged considerably from the original British series. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards including a Peabody Award in 2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for Outstanding Comedy Series, in 2006. The eighth season was criticized for a decline in quality, with Carell's departure in season seven seen as a contributing factor. However, the ninth and final season ended the series with a generally positive response. The series finale, which originally aired on May 16, 2013, was viewed by an estimated 5.7 million viewers and garnered critical acclaim. In 2016, Rolling Stone named The Office one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time. Greg Daniels developed the British Office series for American television and served as the showrunner for the first four seasons of the series. He then left the position when he co-created the comedy series Parks and Recreation with fellow Office writer Michael Schur and divided his time between both series. Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta were named the showrunners for the fifth season. Celotta left the series after the sixth season and Lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons. He left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential Dwight Schrute spin-off, The Farm, which was eventually passed on by NBC. Daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season. Other executive producers include cast members B. J. Novak and Mindy Kaling. Kaling, Novak, Daniels, Lieberstein and Schur made up the original team of writers. Kaling, Novak, and Lieberstein also served multiple roles on the series, as they played regular characters on the show, as well as wrote, directed, and produced episodes. Credited with twenty-four episodes, Kaling is the most prolific writer among the staff. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British series, are credited as executive producers and wrote both pilot and the third-season episode 'The Convict'. Merchant later directed the episode 'Customer Survey', while Gervais appeared in the episodes 'The Seminar' and 'Search Committee', reprising his role as David Brent from the British series. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> When it came to choosing the theme music for The Office, producer Greg Daniels had several tracks he was thinking of using: existing songs including 'Better Things' by The Kinks, 'Float On' by Modest Mouse, and 'Mr. Blue Sky' by Electric Light Orchestra, and several original pieces artists contributed to the producers via a cattle call. Daniels decided that the cast would vote on what song to use and gave them four of the choices. Most of them wanted 'Mr. Blue Sky', but that option turned out to be invalid as it was already used in the drama series LAX (2004–2005). Thus, the final choice was an original track written by Jay Ferguson and performed by The Scrantones. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> For many viewers, The Office is also what made Steve Carell a star. Before he starred in comedies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Anchorman, Carell was Michael Scott on The Office. The show, which is also known as one of the first series to popularize the mockumentary-style comedy, has also been nominated for dozens of Emmys and won Outstanding Comedy Series in 2006. While it's critical and commercial success was a plug, we're also sure that The Office cast salary wasn't bad either. Find out how much six of the main cast members made when the show was on air ahead. Steve Carell Image: Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $80 million Salary: $175,000 per episode It's no secret that Carell was the breakout star from The Office. After the show's first season in 2003, Carell booked roles in blockbuster films like Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Evan Almighty. While he's a household name now, Carell, who played Dunder Mifflin Regional Manager Michael Scott, didn't have the same star-level salary in season 1 of The Office. It's reported that the actor made $87,000 per episode for seasons 1 and 2 before a raise to $175,000 per episode for season 3. It's unclear what Carell made for the other six seasons, but even if he did still have that $175,000 per episode rate, he would've raked in around $3.5 million each season, which is more than a lot of other hit shows out there. Celebrity Net Worth reports that he's worth $80 million. John Krasinski Image: Chris Haston/Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $30 million Salary: $100,000 per episode </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Fischer played Dunder Mifflin receptionist Pam Beesly. According to Cheat Sheet, Fischer was also included in the $20,000 per episode pay scale for the series' first three seasons. By season 4, her salary was raised to $100,000 per episode, which would've paid her close to $2.8 million per season by The Office's end. While on The Office, Fischer starred in films like Blades of Glory and Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. According to Celebrity Net Worth, she's worth $16 million. Rainn Wilson Image: Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $14 million Salary: $100,000 per episode </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Angela Kinsey, known for her role as Angela Martin, has a net worth of $8 million and has continued to work on other projects. The lovable secretary Pam Beesly, played by Jenna Fischer, has a net worth of $12 million and has appeared in other comedies alongside The Office. The ninth and final season of The Office ended in 2013, but fans would continue to stream the show on Netflix for years, making the comedy one of the most-watched shows on the streaming platform. It would later move to Peacock, the streaming service for NBCUniversal - and once again, fans just kept binging the sensation. It's safe to say, The Office is a beloved piece of programming, and that is certainly reflected in its stars' bank accounts. Over the years, most of the main cast members from The Office have continued to work and grow their net worths since the show. Steve Carell, for one, is now an Oscar-nominated movie star, and went on to act in hits like The Morning Show and Space Force. John Krasinski, meanwhile, has become a renowned director (hello, A Quiet Place) and action hero in Jack Ryan. As for fellow show alums Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, they've continued to capitalize on the show, shifting their focus to podcasting, through their Office-themed podcast, Office Ladies. Related Fans Were Not Surprised By 'Secrets' In An Unaired The Office Episode An unaired episode with an interesting plot for Kevin Malone surprised no one when Brian Baumgartner revealed the details. There is no doubt that The Office has made the cast members millionaires, but just how much money is each actor from the show really worth, today? Whose net worth is the highest? Take a look below and see which cast members of the widely popular show earn the most money. Updated November 2023: 'The Office' remains one of the most popular shows of all time. However, with the hit series leaving Netflix, fans of the series had to either watch the show syndicated on cable or subscribe to Peacock. But regardless of where 'The Office' can be seen, it is clear by the resumes of its stars that it launched the careers of just about all the actors. And with all the stars currently involved in television and filmmaking, it appears that their careers will continue to boost their net worths well into the future. 10 Angela Kinsey Net Worth: $8 Million via Instar Character on The Office: Angela Martin </p>",2025-11-20 15:12:02-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Find out how much six of the main cast members made when the show was on air ahead. Steve Carell Image: Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $80 million Salary: $175,000 per episode It's no secret that Carell was the breakout star from The Office. After the show's first season in 2003, Carell booked roles in blockbuster films like Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Evan Almighty. While he's a household name now, Carell, who played Dunder Mifflin Regional Manager Michael Scott, didn't have the same star-level salary in season 1 of The Office. It's reported that the actor made $87,000 per episode for seasons 1 and 2 before a raise to $175,000 per episode for season 3. It's unclear what Carell made for the other six seasons, but even if he did still have that $175,000 per episode rate, he would've raked in around $3.5 million each season, which is more than a lot of other hit shows out there. Celebrity Net Worth reports that he's worth $80 million. John Krasinski Image: Chris Haston/Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $30 million Salary: $100,000 per episode </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Fischer played Dunder Mifflin receptionist Pam Beesly. According to Cheat Sheet, Fischer was also included in the $20,000 per episode pay scale for the series' first three seasons. By season 4, her salary was raised to $100,000 per episode, which would've paid her close to $2.8 million per season by The Office's end. While on The Office, Fischer starred in films like Blades of Glory and Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. According to Celebrity Net Worth, she's worth $16 million. Rainn Wilson Image: Nbc-Tv/Kobal/Shutterstock. Net worth: $14 million Salary: $100,000 per episode </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Angela Kinsey, known for her role as Angela Martin, has a net worth of $8 million and has continued to work on other projects. The lovable secretary Pam Beesly, played by Jenna Fischer, has a net worth of $12 million and has appeared in other comedies alongside The Office. The ninth and final season of The Office ended in 2013, but fans would continue to stream the show on Netflix for years, making the comedy one of the most-watched shows on the streaming platform. It would later move to Peacock, the streaming service for NBCUniversal - and once again, fans just kept binging the sensation. It's safe to say, The Office is a beloved piece of programming, and that is certainly reflected in its stars' bank accounts. Over the years, most of the main cast members from The Office have continued to work and grow their net worths since the show. Steve Carell, for one, is now an Oscar-nominated movie star, and went on to act in hits like The Morning Show and Space Force. John Krasinski, meanwhile, has become a renowned director (hello, A Quiet Place) and action hero in Jack Ryan. As for fellow show alums Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, they've continued to capitalize on the show, shifting their focus to podcasting, through their Office-themed podcast, Office Ladies. Related Fans Were Not Surprised By 'Secrets' In An Unaired The Office Episode An unaired episode with an interesting plot for Kevin Malone surprised no one when Brian Baumgartner revealed the details. There is no doubt that The Office has made the cast members millionaires, but just how much money is each actor from the show really worth, today? Whose net worth is the highest? Take a look below and see which cast members of the widely popular show earn the most money. Updated November 2023: 'The Office' remains one of the most popular shows of all time. However, with the hit series leaving Netflix, fans of the series had to either watch the show syndicated on cable or subscribe to Peacock. But regardless of where 'The Office' can be seen, it is clear by the resumes of its stars that it launched the careers of just about all the actors. And with all the stars currently involved in television and filmmaking, it appears that their careers will continue to boost their net worths well into the future. 10 Angela Kinsey Net Worth: $8 Million via Instar Character on The Office: Angela Martin </p>",2025-11-21 04:46:19-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Explain to a third-grader: who makes history the leader or the mass movement,ETA3G,"""In making history the masses have traversed a course of gradually developing from being unaware to being aware""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Hoffer states that mass movements begin with a widespread 'desire for change' from discontented people who place their locus of control outside their power and who also have no confidence in existing culture or traditions. Feeling their lives are 'irredeemably spoiled' and believing there is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual, true believers seek 'self-renunciation'. Thus, such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives in a larger collective. Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts. While mass movements are usually some blend of nationalist, political and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: 'All mass movements are competitive' and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and 'all mass movements are interchangeable'. As examples of the interchangeable nature of mass movements, Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for the same type of angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals. Part 2. The Potential Converts </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Mass movements demand a 'total surrender of a distinct self'. One identifies the most as 'a member of a certain tribe or family,' whether religious, political, revolutionary, or nationalist. Every important part of the true believer's persona and life must ultimately come from their identification with the larger community; even when alone, the true believer must never feel isolated and unwatched. Hoffer identifies this communal sensibility as the reappearance of a 'primitive state of being' common among pre-modern cultures. Mass movements also use play-acting and spectacle designed to make the individual feel overwhelmed and awed by their membership in the tribe, as with the massive ceremonial parades and speeches of the Nazis. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Fanaticism is encouraged in mass movements. Hoffer argues that 'the fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure' and thus uses uncompromising action and personal sacrifice to give meaning to his life. Part 4. Beginning and End Hoffer identifies three main personality types as the leaders of mass movements, 'men of words', 'fanatics', and 'practical men of action'. No person falls exclusively into one category, and their predominant quality may shift over time. Mass movements begin with 'men of words' or 'fault-finding intellectuals' such as clergy, journalists, academics, and students who condemn the established social order (such as Trotsky, Mohammed, and Lenin). The men of words feel unjustly excluded from or mocked and oppressed by the existing powers in society, and they relentlessly criticize or denigrate present institutions. Invariably speaking out in the name of disadvantaged commoners, the man of words is actually motivated by a deep personal grievance. The man of words relentlessly attempts to 'discredit the prevailing creeds' and creates a 'hunger for faith' which is then fed by 'doctrines and slogans of the new faith'. A cadre of devotees gradually develops around the man of words, leading to the next stage in a mass movement. Eventually, the fanatic takes over leadership of the mass movement from the man of words.

Explain to a third-grader: who makes history the leader or the mass movement,ETA3G,"""Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Hoffer states that mass movements begin with a widespread 'desire for change' from discontented people who place their locus of control outside their power and who also have no confidence in existing culture or traditions. Feeling their lives are 'irredeemably spoiled' and believing there is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual, true believers seek 'self-renunciation'. Thus, such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives in a larger collective. Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts. While mass movements are usually some blend of nationalist, political and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: 'All mass movements are competitive' and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and 'all mass movements are interchangeable'. As examples of the interchangeable nature of mass movements, Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for the same type of angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals. Part 2. The Potential Converts </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Mass movements demand a 'total surrender of a distinct self'. One identifies the most as 'a member of a certain tribe or family,' whether religious, political, revolutionary, or nationalist. Every important part of the true believer's persona and life must ultimately come from their identification with the larger community; even when alone, the true believer must never feel isolated and unwatched. Hoffer identifies this communal sensibility as the reappearance of a 'primitive state of being' common among pre-modern cultures. Mass movements also use play-acting and spectacle designed to make the individual feel overwhelmed and awed by their membership in the tribe, as with the massive ceremonial parades and speeches of the Nazis. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Fanaticism is encouraged in mass movements. Hoffer argues that 'the fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure' and thus uses uncompromising action and personal sacrifice to give meaning to his life. Part 4. Beginning and End Hoffer identifies three main personality types as the leaders of mass movements, 'men of words', 'fanatics', and 'practical men of action'. No person falls exclusively into one category, and their predominant quality may shift over time. Mass movements begin with 'men of words' or 'fault-finding intellectuals' such as clergy, journalists, academics, and students who condemn the established social order (such as Trotsky, Mohammed, and Lenin). The men of words feel unjustly excluded from or mocked and oppressed by the existing powers in society, and they relentlessly criticize or denigrate present institutions. Invariably speaking out in the name of disadvantaged commoners, the man of words is actually motivated by a deep personal grievance. The man of words relentlessly attempts to 'discredit the prevailing creeds' and creates a 'hunger for faith' which is then fed by 'doctrines and slogans of the new faith'. A cadre of devotees gradually develops around the man of words, leading to the next stage in a mass movement. Eventually, the fanatic takes over leadership of the mass movement from the man of words. While the 'creative man of words' finds satisfaction in his literature, philosophy or art, the 'noncreative man of words' feels unrecognized or stifled and thus veers into an extremism against the social order. Though the man of words and the fanatic share a discontent with the world, the fanatic is distinguished by his viciousness and urge to destroy.

Highlights from Season 8 include Pamela Adlon learning the identity of her maternal grandfather; and Rebecca Hall learning of her maternal grandfather's African American background, which he had kept hidden (a discovery that inspired Hall's directorial film debut, 'Passing').

Explain to a third-grader: who commissioned the first christmas card in 1943,ETA3G,"""The Christmas card that holds the world record as the most expensive ever sold was a card produced in 1843 by J. C. Horsley and commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> A Christmas card is a greeting card sent as part of the traditional celebration of Christmas in order to convey between people a range of sentiments related to Christmastide and the holiday season. Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including some non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads 'wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year'. There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer, Christmas song lyrics or Biblical verse; others focus on the general holiday season with an all-inclusive 'Season's greetings'. The first modern Christmas card was by John Calcott Horsley. A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves. History The world's first commercially produced Christmas card, designed by John Callcott Horsley for Henry Cole in 1843 Children looking at Christmas cards in New York 1910 Christmas card by Louis Prang, showing a group of anthropomorphized frogs parading with banner and band. The first known Christmas card was sent by Michael Maier to James I of England and his son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1611. It was discovered in 1979 by Adam McLean in the Scottish Record Office. It was hand-made and incorporated Rosicrucian imagery, with the words of the greeting – 'A greeting on the birthday of the Sacred King, to the most worshipful and energetic lord and most eminent James, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Defender of the true faith, with a gesture of joyful celebration of the Birthday of the Lord, in most joyand fortune, we enter into the new auspicious year 1612' – being laid out to form a rose. The first commercially available card was commissioned by Sir Henry Cole and designed by John Callcott Horsley in London 1843. The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor. Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each. Early British cards rarely showed winter or religious themes, instead favoring flowers, fairies and other fanciful designs that reminded the recipient of the approach of spring. Humorous and sentimental images of children and animals were popular, as were increasingly elaborate shapes, decorations and materials. At Christmas 1873, the lithograph firm Prang and Mayer began creating greeting cards for the popular market in Britain. The firm began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874, thus becoming the first printer to offer cards in America. Its owner, Louis Prang, is sometimes called the 'father of the American Christmas card.' By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the chromolithography process of printmaking. However, the popularity of his cards led to cheap imitations that eventually drove him from the market. The advent of the postcard spelled the end for elaborate Victorian-style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day, including Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card. The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand Hallmark Cards was established in 1913 by Joyce Hall with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards. The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of World War I increased demand for cards to send to soldiers. The World Wars brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic 'studio cards' with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of Victorian and Edwardian cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004. Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters – especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone. Some card manufacturers now provide E-cards. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period. In mostly non-religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are called New Year Cards; they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols. Official Christmas cards President Johnson's 1967 White House Christmas card 'Official' Christmas cards began with Queen Victoria in the 1840s. The British royal family's cards are generally portraits reflecting significant personal events of the year. There is a long-standing custom for the American President and First Lady to send White House Christmas Cards each holiday season. The practice originated with President Calvin Coolidge, who was the first president to issue a written statement of peaceful tidings during the holidays in 1927. President Herbert Hoover was the first to give Christmas notes to the White House staff, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to utilize the card format (rather than the previously used notes or a written statement) that most closely resembles the Christmas cards of today. In 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first official White House card. The cards usually depict White House scenes as rendered by prominent American artists. The number of recipients has snowballed over the decades, from just 2,000 in 1961 to 1.4 million in 2005. Commercial Christmas cards Tucker Corporation Christmas Card, 1947 Many organizations produce special Christmas cards as a fundraising tool. The most famous of these enterprises is probably the UNICEF Christmas card program, launched in 1949, which selects artwork from internationally known artists for card reproduction. The UK-based Charities Advisory Trust used to give out an annual 'Scrooge Award' to the cards that return the smallest percentage to the charities they claim to support although it is not universally well received by the Christmas card producers. The RSPB produced the first ever charity Christmas card in 1898, selling 4,500 that year  Christmas stamps and stickers Santa Coming Down the Chimney Many countries produce official Christmas stamps, which may be brightly coloured and depict some aspect of Christmas tradition or a Nativity scene. Small decorative stickers are also made to seal the back of envelopes, typically showing a trinket or some symbol of Christmas. From the beginning, Christmas cards have been avidly collected. Queen Mary amassed a large collection that is now housed in the British Museum. The University College London's Slade School of Fine Art houses a collection of handmade Christmas Cards from alumni such as Paula Rego and Richard Hamilton and are displayed at events over the Christmas season, when members of the public can make their own Christmas cards in the Strang Print Room. Specimens from the 'golden age' of printing (1840s–1890s) are especially prized and bring in large sums at auctions. In December 2005, one of Horsley's original cards sold for nearly £9,000. Collectors may focus on particular images like Santa Claus, poets, or printing techniques. The Christmas card that holds the world record as the most expensive ever sold was a card produced in 1843 by J. C. Horsley and commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole. The card, one of the world's first, was sold in 2001 by UK auctioneers Henry Aldridge to an anonymous bidder for a record breaking £22,250. </p>",2025-11-20 15:06:26-08:00,False,Response is valid.

The advent of the postcard spelled the end for elaborate Victorian-style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day, including Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card. The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand Hallmark Cards was established in 1913 by Joyce Hall with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards. The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of World War I increased demand for cards to send to soldiers. The World Wars brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic 'studio cards' with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of Victorian and Edwardian cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004. Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters – especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone. Some card manufacturers now provide E-cards. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period. In mostly non-religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are called New Year Cards; they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols. Official Christmas cards President Johnson's 1967 White House Christmas card 'Official' Christmas cards began with Queen Victoria in the 1840s. The British royal family's cards are generally portraits reflecting significant personal events of the year. There is a long-standing custom for the American President and First Lady to send White House Christmas Cards each holiday season. The practice originated with President Calvin Coolidge, who was the first president to issue a written statement of peaceful tidings during the holidays in 1927. President Herbert Hoover was the first to give Christmas notes to the White House staff, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to utilize the card format (rather than the previously used notes or a written statement) that most closely resembles the Christmas cards of today. In 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first official White House card. The cards usually depict White House scenes as rendered by prominent American artists. The number of recipients has snowballed over the decades, from just 2,000 in 1961 to 1.4 million in 2005. Commercial Christmas cards Tucker Corporation Christmas Card, 1947 Many organizations produce special Christmas cards as a fundraising tool. The most famous of these enterprises is probably the UNICEF Christmas card program, launched in 1949, which selects artwork from internationally known artists for card reproduction. The UK-based Charities Advisory Trust used to give out an annual 'Scrooge Award' to the cards that return the smallest percentage to the charities they claim to support although it is not universally well received by the Christmas card producers. The RSPB produced the first ever charity Christmas card in 1898, selling 4,500 that year  Christmas stamps and stickers Santa Coming Down the Chimney Many countries produce official Christmas stamps, which may be brightly coloured and depict some aspect of Christmas tradition or a Nativity scene. Small decorative stickers are also made to seal the back of envelopes, typically showing a trinket or some symbol of Christmas. From the beginning, Christmas cards have been avidly collected. Queen Mary amassed a large collection that is now housed in the British Museum. The University College London's Slade School of Fine Art houses a collection of handmade Christmas Cards from alumni such as Paula Rego and Richard Hamilton and are displayed at events over the Christmas season, when members of the public can make their own Christmas cards in the Strang Print Room. Specimens from the 'golden age' of printing (1840s–1890s) are especially prized and bring in large sums at auctions. In December 2005, one of Horsley's original cards sold for nearly £9,000. Collectors may focus on particular images like Santa Claus, poets, or printing techniques. The Christmas card that holds the world record as the most expensive ever sold was a card produced in 1843 by J. C. Horsley and commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole. The card, one of the world's first, was sold in 2001 by UK auctioneers Henry Aldridge to an anonymous bidder for a record breaking £22,250. </p>",2025-11-21 04:55:03-08:00,False,Response is valid.

At the start of the war, the French colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers, compared with 2 million in the British colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on their native allies. Two years into the war, in 1756, Great Britain declared war on France, beginning the worldwide Seven Years' War.

The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois, Catawba, and Cherokee tribes, and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy member tribes Abenaki and Mi'kmaq, and the Algonquin, Lenape, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Shawnee, and Wyandot (Huron) tribes. Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from the Province of Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north. It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River called the Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne at the location that later became Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

An early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July, 1754. The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with the Indians, since the allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding.

Here are 10 facts about the French and Indian War, a conflict that is often regarded as a spark that led to the American Revolution. Fact #1: It was part of a global warThe French and Indian War refers to the North American theater of the overarching global war known as the Seven Years' War in Europe. The French and Indian War was fought between Great Britain and France and their colonists, as well as Native American tribes. They fought over territories and expansion throughout North America.Fact #2: George Washington essentially set off the war in North America In 1754, Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, a 22 year old commander of British forces set off with his men towards the coveted Ohio River Valley to assist in building a fort. A small French company of soldiers led by Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville departed French Fort Duquesne to scout intelligence about British movements. When young Washington became aware of the French movement, he set out with his party to meet them, and ambushed them near Great Meadows in Pennsylvania. When the two sides met, Washington ordered his troops to fire, igniting a battle that resulted in the death of Ensign de Jumonville and 9 other French soldiers. After this battle, the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington moved his men into the Great Meadows, an open field, and crudely constructed Fort Necessity as a base. A few weeks later, French forces surrounded the British at Fort Necessity, forcing George Washington to surrender and unknowingly, due to poor translation, sign a document admitting to the assassination of Ensign de Jumonville. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Though often remembered as a frontier colonial war, the French and Indian War was in fact just one theater in a larger global war known as the Seven Years' War. The French and Indian War represented a clash of empires, people, and cultures, as international interests clashed over the future of the continent of North America.The entire global conflict erupted over a power struggle in the Ohio Valley between the British, the French, and the Native Americans. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish, Dutch, British, and French pioneers explored and colonized different parts of North America. The Spanish settled in the Southern and Western parts of the continent, the French in the Northern parts, the Dutch in the Northeast part, and the British on the eastern seaboard. As European explorers encountered American Indians on the continent, conflict often arose. The Europeans and Indians went through numerous periods of peace and warfare. As the various European colonists moved into different areas of the continent, it often brought them into conflict with each other. While the nations fought wars on the European continent, similar warfare broke out in the various colonies as they each struggled for supremacy of the North American continent. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The French and Indian War (1754-1763) is the name given to the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), a global conflict involving the major powers of Europe. Though war was not formally declared until 1756, armed conflict began in 1754 as disputes over land claims in the Ohio Valley lead to a series of frontier battles between the French and British. Both received support from various Native American tribes, though the outnumbered French became far more dependent on these allies as the war progressed. The French saw a number of early victories, most notably over George Washington and Edward Braddock in Western Pennsylvania. Washington quickly became a central figure in the conflict, maturing during his tenure in the Virginia militia from an inexperienced young major to the commander in chief of the colony's regiment. Washington's involvement during the war's early stages provided the future President with invaluable military experience while also gaining him positive notoriety that helped to launch his future political career. The tide turned in favor of the British in 1757 when King George II appointed Secretary of State William Pitt to commander of wartime operations.  Pitt believed that securing victories in North America would ensure Britain's global success, and reinvigorated the war effort by reorganizing military leadership and strengthening the Crown's relationship with its colonists in America. British assaults on strategic outposts such as Ticonderoga, Niagara, and Quebec in 1759, followed by the successful siege of Montreal in September of 1760, prompted the French surrender. Though Britain's victory in the French and Indian War expelled France from North America and secured massive territorial gains for the empire, subsequent Crown policies concerning taxation and westward expansion resulted in widespread colonial discontent. The conflict and its aftermath produced substantial ideological divisions between Britain and her North American colonies that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of the American Revolution. The French and Indian War was one of many French-British conflicts fought during the Second Hundred Years' War (1689-1815), a historical era that included King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's War (1702-1713) and King George's War (1744-1748). The struggle for control over North America that developed into the French and Indian War materialized in the mid-eighteenth century due to a dispute over French land claims in North America. Between 1700 and 1750, the colonial populations of Canada and Louisiana increased significantly, forcing expansion into the Ohio River Valley region. As settlement in this area and the Lower Mississippi Valley increased, New France increased her agricultural output and invested heavily in Louisiana's sugar economy. During this period, the French strengthened military ties and existing trade relationships with numerous Indian societies, sparking competition with the British for Indigenous allies. By 1749, population growth in the East and a desire for landed wealth from colonial elites prompted the Virginia House of Burgesses to issue large grants of territory in the West to private land companies, such as the Ohio Company. However, competing claims from the French challenged the Ohio Company's plan for future sale of these lands, prompting the colony of Virginia to initiate efforts toward halting the construction of French forts in western Pennsylvania and removing these rivals from the region. In late October of 1753, twenty-one-year-old George Washington, a major in the Virginia Militia, volunteered to deliver a message to the French on behalf of the colony's governor, Robert Dinwiddie. The ultimatum ordered that the French halt construction on Fort LeBoeuf in Western Pennsylvania and evacuate lands in the Ohio Valley, or else face an armed attack. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> The Seven Years' War pitted the alliance of Britain, Prussia and Hanover against the alliance of France, Austria, Sweden, Saxony, Russia, and eventually Spain. The war was driven by the commercial and imperial rivalry between Britain and France, and by the antagonism between Prussia (allied to Britain) and Austria (allied to France). In Europe, Britain sent troops to help its ally, Prussia, which was surrounded by its enemies. However, the main British war aim was to destroy France as a commercial rival, and they therefore focused on attacking the French navy and colonies overseas. France was committed to fighting in Europe to defend its ally, Austria. It therefore had few resources to spare for its colonies.

After this battle, the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington moved his men into the Great Meadows, an open field, and crudely constructed Fort Necessity as a base. A few weeks later, French forces surrounded the British at Fort Necessity, forcing George Washington to surrender and unknowingly, due to poor translation, sign a document admitting to the assassination of Ensign de Jumonville. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Though often remembered as a frontier colonial war, the French and Indian War was in fact just one theater in a larger global war known as the Seven Years' War. The French and Indian War represented a clash of empires, people, and cultures, as international interests clashed over the future of the continent of North America.The entire global conflict erupted over a power struggle in the Ohio Valley between the British, the French, and the Native Americans. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish, Dutch, British, and French pioneers explored and colonized different parts of North America. The Spanish settled in the Southern and Western parts of the continent, the French in the Northern parts, the Dutch in the Northeast part, and the British on the eastern seaboard. As European explorers encountered American Indians on the continent, conflict often arose. The Europeans and Indians went through numerous periods of peace and warfare. As the various European colonists moved into different areas of the continent, it often brought them into conflict with each other. While the nations fought wars on the European continent, similar warfare broke out in the various colonies as they each struggled for supremacy of the North American continent. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The French and Indian War (1754-1763) is the name given to the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), a global conflict involving the major powers of Europe. Though war was not formally declared until 1756, armed conflict began in 1754 as disputes over land claims in the Ohio Valley lead to a series of frontier battles between the French and British. Both received support from various Native American tribes, though the outnumbered French became far more dependent on these allies as the war progressed. The French saw a number of early victories, most notably over George Washington and Edward Braddock in Western Pennsylvania. Washington quickly became a central figure in the conflict, maturing during his tenure in the Virginia militia from an inexperienced young major to the commander in chief of the colony's regiment. Washington's involvement during the war's early stages provided the future President with invaluable military experience while also gaining him positive notoriety that helped to launch his future political career. The tide turned in favor of the British in 1757 when King George II appointed Secretary of State William Pitt to commander of wartime operations.  Pitt believed that securing victories in North America would ensure Britain's global success, and reinvigorated the war effort by reorganizing military leadership and strengthening the Crown's relationship with its colonists in America. British assaults on strategic outposts such as Ticonderoga, Niagara, and Quebec in 1759, followed by the successful siege of Montreal in September of 1760, prompted the French surrender. Though Britain's victory in the French and Indian War expelled France from North America and secured massive territorial gains for the empire, subsequent Crown policies concerning taxation and westward expansion resulted in widespread colonial discontent. The conflict and its aftermath produced substantial ideological divisions between Britain and her North American colonies that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of the American Revolution. The French and Indian War was one of many French-British conflicts fought during the Second Hundred Years' War (1689-1815), a historical era that included King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's War (1702-1713) and King George's War (1744-1748). The struggle for control over North America that developed into the French and Indian War materialized in the mid-eighteenth century due to a dispute over French land claims in North America. Between 1700 and 1750, the colonial populations of Canada and Louisiana increased significantly, forcing expansion into the Ohio River Valley region. As settlement in this area and the Lower Mississippi Valley increased, New France increased her agricultural output and invested heavily in Louisiana's sugar economy. During this period, the French strengthened military ties and existing trade relationships with numerous Indian societies, sparking competition with the British for Indigenous allies. By 1749, population growth in the East and a desire for landed wealth from colonial elites prompted the Virginia House of Burgesses to issue large grants of territory in the West to private land companies, such as the Ohio Company. However, competing claims from the French challenged the Ohio Company's plan for future sale of these lands, prompting the colony of Virginia to initiate efforts toward halting the construction of French forts in western Pennsylvania and removing these rivals from the region. In late October of 1753, twenty-one-year-old George Washington, a major in the Virginia Militia, volunteered to deliver a message to the French on behalf of the colony's governor, Robert Dinwiddie. The ultimatum ordered that the French halt construction on Fort LeBoeuf in Western Pennsylvania and evacuate lands in the Ohio Valley, or else face an armed attack. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> The Seven Years' War pitted the alliance of Britain, Prussia and Hanover against the alliance of France, Austria, Sweden, Saxony, Russia, and eventually Spain. The war was driven by the commercial and imperial rivalry between Britain and France, and by the antagonism between Prussia (allied to Britain) and Austria (allied to France). In Europe, Britain sent troops to help its ally, Prussia, which was surrounded by its enemies. However, the main British war aim was to destroy France as a commercial rival, and they therefore focused on attacking the French navy and colonies overseas. France was committed to fighting in Europe to defend its ally, Austria. It therefore had few resources to spare for its colonies.

Miller, played by Nicolas Cage, is a buffalo hunter who convinces an idealistic Harvard student named Will Andrews (Fred Hechinger) to fund an expedition from Kansas to Colorado to take down a massive herd. They're joined by a skinner (Jeremy Bobb) and a cook (Xander Berkeley). The group's planned trip ultimately becomes a test of endurance as Miller's obsession with killing more animals, to make more money from their hides, keeps them at camp so long that winter rolls in, trapping them—and hundreds of buffalo they'd already slaughtered.1 Year of 5280 for just $19.95 $12.That's only $1 per issue!Subscribe Today » Before heading to the theater, here are five things you should know about the film. University of Denver Professor John Williams wrote the book on which the movie is based. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> In the early 19th century, somewhere between 30 and 50 million bison roamed the Great Plains. (Though the U.S. brethren of this species are called American bison, they're often referred to as buffalo.) Then bison hides became a popular fashion item, and the animals were hunted to near extinction by frontiersmen eager to make a buck—until the wares fell out of fashion. By 1902, less than 100 wild bison remained. This threatened the livelihood of Indigenous tribes who relied on the animals for sustenance, warmth, and ceremonial purposes. Careful viewers will note that the 1874 expedition is to Colorado—although Colorado didn't become a state until 1876. Director Gabe Polsky wrote the first draft of the screenplay in a Basalt library. 'I've been going to Colorado since I was a kid,' Polsky says. 'It's restorative. It's epic. And just part of my soul.' Though he's better known for his documentaries—including In Search of Greatness and Red Army—Polsky, 44, says his personal history with the Centennial State is what drew him to Williams' story. 'When I read the book, this idea of the character Will going out and trying to learn about the land and the country and find purpose and meaning, I kind of related to that,' he says. The movie takes place in Colorado but wasn't filmed in the Centennial State. A still from the new Butcher's Crossing movie, starring Nicolas Cage. Photo by MIchael C.B. Stevens Astute filmgoers will notice that the movie's setting is most definitely not Colorado. The grasses, the peaks, the grandeur—none are quite right. That's because Butcher's Crossing was filmed in Montana, on Blackfeet Nation land with animals from the tribe's Blackfeet Buffalo Program, which maintains a herd of about 600 animals. Though they're noticeably absent from the screen (and the book), tribal members helped herd the animals for filming and also educated the actors on how to properly skin them. Polsky says it was this direct access to buffalo that motivated his decision to film in Montana, along with the state's financial incentives. The bison are making a comeback thanks to tribal efforts. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Where was The Crossing filmed?

The film is stunning from start to finish, a director and cinematographer which has an eye for visuals and puts the nature above everything else except for the actors of course. The West is dirty, muddy and overall an accurate depiction of the Old West.In 1874, Will Andrews, the naive son of a pastor, has dropped out of Harvard and travels to Butcher's Crossing, a tiny frontier town in Kansas built on the buffalo hide trade. Where he joins a team of buffalo hunters on a journey that puts his life and sanity at risk.What's so interesting about this film is the setting and how it delves into the characters psyche, it's a character study of sorts which shows the horrible nature of men and how they shot buffalo for sport. Nicholas Cage portrays the leader of the group, a terrific performance. The skinner, Fred Schneider, is portrayed by Jeremy Bobb and his character is probably the most well written one. He has this small amount of toxic masculinity and is a flawed character but when it comes to nature and animals, he's good. Xander Berkley's character serves no real purpose, making up for scenes which could easily be cut, only purpose he got is the role he got at the camp. My criticism is of the pacing, although I liked it I'm quite sure most will find it off putting. Also some of the writing, dialogue for example is often too modern but works, but also the writing of Nicolas Cage's character Miller, as the writing takes a nose dive for his character after half the film. I've read how some critics find the film's direction to be unfocused and it's noticeable in the second half. I still think the film is good, with Nicolas Cage doing a terrific job as well as the rest of the cast, along with the cinematography never disappointing. With a good message and themes, about masculinity and a warning about what happens when people fail to tread lightly in the natural world, both as a consequence of nature and themselves. Leo Birenberg composed the film and it has a great score.Bear in mind if you watch this film, Butcher's Crossing is flawed around the edges but mostly a good if not a great film. I just wish the second half was as great as the first half, which is not, it becomes a bit strange. Scenes which go hand in hand with the story, the psyche of these men and especially that of Will Andrews. Butcher's Crossing is a hard watch and not much really happens, nor does the characters get fleshed out. Yet, with the low budget that it got and how it uses real buffaloes along with shooting on-location, this film is a great good drama. </p>",2025-11-20 15:25:32-08:00,False,Response is valid.

To complete and correct this report, any feedback, info, or images that you may have are more than welcome, thank you! </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> I've never read Butcher's Crossing, the novel, but I own it. So my review is solely for the film and not the adaptation. I think the cinematography and the production design were the film's highlights. The film is stunning from start to finish, a director and cinematographer which has an eye for visuals and puts the nature above everything else except for the actors of course. The West is dirty, muddy and overall an accurate depiction of the Old West.In 1874, Will Andrews, the naive son of a pastor, has dropped out of Harvard and travels to Butcher's Crossing, a tiny frontier town in Kansas built on the buffalo hide trade. Where he joins a team of buffalo hunters on a journey that puts his life and sanity at risk.What's so interesting about this film is the setting and how it delves into the characters psyche, it's a character study of sorts which shows the horrible nature of men and how they shot buffalo for sport. Nicholas Cage portrays the leader of the group, a terrific performance. The skinner, Fred Schneider, is portrayed by Jeremy Bobb and his character is probably the most well written one. He has this small amount of toxic masculinity and is a flawed character but when it comes to nature and animals, he's good. Xander Berkley's character serves no real purpose, making up for scenes which could easily be cut, only purpose he got is the role he got at the camp. My criticism is of the pacing, although I liked it I'm quite sure most will find it off putting. Also some of the writing, dialogue for example is often too modern but works, but also the writing of Nicolas Cage's character Miller, as the writing takes a nose dive for his character after half the film. I've read how some critics find the film's direction to be unfocused and it's noticeable in the second half. I still think the film is good, with Nicolas Cage doing a terrific job as well as the rest of the cast, along with the cinematography never disappointing. With a good message and themes, about masculinity and a warning about what happens when people fail to tread lightly in the natural world, both as a consequence of nature and themselves. Leo Birenberg composed the film and it has a great score.Bear in mind if you watch this film, Butcher's Crossing is flawed around the edges but mostly a good if not a great film. I just wish the second half was as great as the first half, which is not, it becomes a bit strange. Scenes which go hand in hand with the story, the psyche of these men and especially that of Will Andrews. Butcher's Crossing is a hard watch and not much really happens, nor does the characters get fleshed out. Yet, with the low budget that it got and how it uses real buffaloes along with shooting on-location, this film is a great good drama. </p>",2025-11-21 07:38:31-08:00,False,Response is valid.
Explain to a third-grader: where can oxygen be found in the world,ETA3G,"""Oxygen first appeared in the Earth's atmosphere around 2 billion years ago, accumulating from the photosynthesis of blue-green algae.

There they're exposed to wild, daily temperature swings, and high ultraviolet light conditions. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> It's important to remember that although the ocean produces at least 50% of the oxygen on Earth, roughly the same amount is consumed by marine life. Like animals on land, marine animals use oxygen to breathe, and both plants and animals use oxygen for cellular respiration. Oxygen is also consumed when dead plants and animals decay in the ocean. There is also oxygen in the atmosphere which has accumulated over hundreds of millions of years. As land animals, most of the oxygen humans breathe comes from this source. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Oxygen atoms are very reactive, and are incorporated into many common chemical compounds, such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur oxides (SO2 and SO3), and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2). About 21% of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen. This hasn't always been the case, though. Early in our planet's history, the atmosphere had almost no oxygen. Microbes that produce their food via photosynthesis generate oxygen as a by-product. Oxygen from photosynthetic microbes eventually built up in the atmosphere, drastically changing our planet's environment and the history of life in the process. Oxygen plays a critical role in respiration, the energy-producing chemistry that drives the metabolisms of most living things. We humans, along with many other creatures, need oxygen in the air we breathe to stay alive. Oxygen is generated during photosynthesis by plants and many types of microbes. Plants both use oxygen (during respiration) and produce it (via photosynthesis). </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The present-day distribution of oxygen in the internal deep ocean is thus determined by a complicated and not fully understood interplay of water circulation and bio­logical productivity, which leads to oxygen consumption in the ocean's interior. Extensive measurements have shown that the highest oxygen concentrations are found at high latitudes, where the ocean is cold, especially well-mixed and ventilated. The mid-latitudes, by contrast, especially on the western coasts of the continents, are characterized by marked oxygen-deficient zones. The oxygen supply here is very weak due to the sluggish water circulation, and this is further compounded by ­elevated oxygen consumption due to high biological productivity. This leads to a situation where the oxygen is almost completely depleted in the depth range between 100 and 1000 metres.

Much of the oxygen loss is concentrated in the upper 1000m where species richness and abundance is highest. Even slight overall reductions in the levels of oxygen dissolved in the oceans can induce oxygen stress in marine organisms by depriving them of an adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level (termed hypoxia). The loss of oxygen in the ocean has two major causes: Ocean warming-driven deoxygenation: Warmer ocean water holds less oxygen and is more buoyant than cooler water. This leads to reduced mixing of oxygenated water near the surface with deeper waters, which naturally contain less oxygen. Warmer water also raises oxygen demand from living organisms. As a result, less oxygen is available for marine life. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Virtually all the ocean's food provisioning ecosystem services for humans require oxygen to support organism growth and production. Oxygen is necessary to sustain the life of all the fishes and invertebrates, and deoxygenation is already causing measurable declines of fish species. Some of the ocean's most productive biomes, supporting one fifth of the world's wild marine fish harvest, are formed by ocean currents that bring nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor water to coasts that line the eastern edges of the world's ocean basins. As naturally oxygen-poor systems, these areas are particularly vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation, and such effects may ripple out and affect hundreds of millions of people. Degraded habitats caused by climate change-driven hypoxia and increased algal blooms may lead to reduced catches for fisheries and possible collapse of regional stocks. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> Oxygen first appeared in the Earth's atmosphere around 2 billion years ago, accumulating from the photosynthesis of blue-green algae.

Financial management is the process of attaining goals through careful financial planning, by efficiently controlling, organising, and reviewing the financial resources at disposal. Since these resources are limited and conditions in the finance world constantly change, effective financial management is what guides businesses and individuals toward success. In this blog, let's take a look at the various objectives of financial management, and understand why achieving these financial management goals is vital for any business or individual to thrive. Goals of Financial Management At its core, the primary objective of financial management is to optimise financial resources for the betterment of an individual or an organisation, emphasizing effective financial planning. To achieve this large goal, one has to break it down into smaller goals so it can be made more attainable and easier to manage. Let's explore the goals of financial management in detail. 1. Profit Maximization </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> What Is Strategic Financial Management? Strategic financial management means not only managing a company's finances but managing them with the intention to succeed—that is, to attain the company's long-term goals and objectives and maximize shareholder value over time. Key Takeaways Strategic financial management is about creating profits for the business over the long run.It seeks to maximize return on investment for stakeholders.This differs from tactical management, which looks to seize near-term opportunities.A financial plan is strategic and focuses on long-term gain. Strategic financial planning varies by company, industry, and sector. Understanding Strategic Financial Management Strategic financial management is about creating profit for the business and ensuring an acceptable return on investment (ROI). Financial management is accomplished through business financial plans, setting up financial controls, and financial decision-making. Before a company can manage itself strategically, it first needs to define its objectives precisely, identify and quantify its available and potential resources, and devise a specific plan to use its finances and other capital resources toward achieving its goals. Strategic management also involves understanding and properly controlling, allocating, and obtaining a company's assets and liabilities, including monitoring operational financing items like expenditures, revenues, accounts receivable and payable, cash flow, and profitability. Strategic financial management encompasses furthermore involves continuous evaluating, planning, and adjusting to keep the company focused and on track toward long-term goals. When a company is managing strategically, it deals with short-term issues on an ad hoc basis in ways that do not derail its long-term vision. Strategic financial management includes assessing and managing a company's capital structure, the mix of debt and equity finance employed, to ensure a company's long-term solvency. Strategic Versus Tactical Financial Management The term 'strategic' refers to financial management practices that are focused on long-term success, as opposed to 'tactical' management decisions, which relate to short-term positioning. If a company is being strategic instead of tactical, it makes financial decisions based on what it thinks would achieve results ultimately—that is, in the future—which implies that to realize those results, a firm sometimes must tolerate losses in the present. 'Strategic' management focuses on long-term success and 'tactical' management relates to short-term positioning. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> A company will apply strategic financial management throughout its organizational operations, which involves designing elements that will maximize the firm's financial resources and use them efficiently. Here a firm needs to be creative, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to strategic management, and each company will devise elements that reflect its own particular needs and goals. However, some of the more common elements of strategic financial management could include the following. Planning Define objectives precisely.Identify and quantify available and potential resources.Write a specific business financial plan. Budgeting Help the company function with financial efficiency, and reduce waste.Identify areas that incur the most operating costs, or exceed the budgeted cost.Ensure sufficient liquidity to cover operating expenses without tapping external resources.Uncover areas where a firm may invest earnings to achieve goals more effectively. Managing and Assessing Risk </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Having a long-term focus helps a company maintain its goals, even as short-term rough patches or opportunities come and go. As a result, strategic management helps keep a firm profitable and stable by sticking to its long-run plan. Strategic management not only sets company targets but sets guidelines for achieving those objectives even as challenges appear along the way. What Is the Scope of Strategic Financial Management? Strategic management can encompass all aspects of a firm's long-term objectives. Financial management often plays a key role in this, which involves cost reduction, risk management, and budgeting. What Is the Ultimate Objective of Strategic Financial Management? The goal of strategic financial management is to ensure that long-term goals are properly planned for and ultimately met. Open a New Bank Account Advertiser Disclosure × </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> A value creation mindset means that senior managers are fully aware that their ultimate financial objective is maximizing value; that they have clear rules for deciding when other objectives (such as employment or environmental goals) outweigh this imperative; and that they have a solid analytical understanding of which performance variables drive the value of the company. They must know, for instance, whether more value is created by increasing revenue growth or by improving margins, and they must ensure that their strategy focuses resources and attention on the right option. Management processes and systems encourage managers and employees to behave in a way that maximizes the value of the organization. Planning, target setting, performance measurement, and incentive systems are working effectively when the communication that surrounds them is tightly linked to value creation. The value mindset The first step in VBM is embracing value maximization as the ultimate financial objective for a company. Traditional financial performance measures, such as earnings or earnings growth, are not always good proxies for value creation. To focus more directly on creating value, companies should set goals in terms of discounted cash flow value, the most direct measure of value creation. Such targets also need to be translated into shorter-term, more objective financial performance targets. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> Objectives must also be tailored to the different levels within an organization. For the head of a business unit, the objective may be explicit value creation measured in financial terms. A functional manager's goals could be expressed in terms of customer service, market share, product quality, or productivity. A manufacturing manager might focus on cost per unit, cycle time, or defect rate. In product development, the issues might be the time it takes to develop a new product, the number of products developed, and their performance compared with the competition. Even within the realm of financial goals, managers are often confronted with many choices: boosting earnings per share, maximizing the price/earnings ratio or the market-to-book ratio, and increasing the return on assets, to name a few. We strongly believe that value is the only correct criterion of performance. </p>",2025-11-20 15:40:42-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Financial management is the process of attaining goals through careful financial planning, by efficiently controlling, organising, and reviewing the financial resources at disposal. Since these resources are limited and conditions in the finance world constantly change, effective financial management is what guides businesses and individuals toward success. In this blog, let's take a look at the various objectives of financial management, and understand why achieving these financial management goals is vital for any business or individual to thrive. Goals of Financial Management At its core, the primary objective of financial management is to optimise financial resources for the betterment of an individual or an organisation, emphasizing effective financial planning. To achieve this large goal, one has to break it down into smaller goals so it can be made more attainable and easier to manage. Let's explore the goals of financial management in detail. 1. Profit Maximization </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> What Is Strategic Financial Management? Strategic financial management means not only managing a company's finances but managing them with the intention to succeed—that is, to attain the company's long-term goals and objectives and maximize shareholder value over time. Key Takeaways Strategic financial management is about creating profits for the business over the long run.It seeks to maximize return on investment for stakeholders.This differs from tactical management, which looks to seize near-term opportunities.A financial plan is strategic and focuses on long-term gain. Strategic financial planning varies by company, industry, and sector. Understanding Strategic Financial Management Strategic financial management is about creating profit for the business and ensuring an acceptable return on investment (ROI). Financial management is accomplished through business financial plans, setting up financial controls, and financial decision-making. Before a company can manage itself strategically, it first needs to define its objectives precisely, identify and quantify its available and potential resources, and devise a specific plan to use its finances and other capital resources toward achieving its goals. Strategic management also involves understanding and properly controlling, allocating, and obtaining a company's assets and liabilities, including monitoring operational financing items like expenditures, revenues, accounts receivable and payable, cash flow, and profitability. Strategic financial management encompasses furthermore involves continuous evaluating, planning, and adjusting to keep the company focused and on track toward long-term goals. When a company is managing strategically, it deals with short-term issues on an ad hoc basis in ways that do not derail its long-term vision. Strategic financial management includes assessing and managing a company's capital structure, the mix of debt and equity finance employed, to ensure a company's long-term solvency. Strategic Versus Tactical Financial Management The term 'strategic' refers to financial management practices that are focused on long-term success, as opposed to 'tactical' management decisions, which relate to short-term positioning. If a company is being strategic instead of tactical, it makes financial decisions based on what it thinks would achieve results ultimately—that is, in the future—which implies that to realize those results, a firm sometimes must tolerate losses in the present. 'Strategic' management focuses on long-term success and 'tactical' management relates to short-term positioning. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> A company will apply strategic financial management throughout its organizational operations, which involves designing elements that will maximize the firm's financial resources and use them efficiently. Here a firm needs to be creative, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to strategic management, and each company will devise elements that reflect its own particular needs and goals. However, some of the more common elements of strategic financial management could include the following. Planning Define objectives precisely.Identify and quantify available and potential resources.Write a specific business financial plan. Budgeting Help the company function with financial efficiency, and reduce waste.Identify areas that incur the most operating costs, or exceed the budgeted cost.Ensure sufficient liquidity to cover operating expenses without tapping external resources.Uncover areas where a firm may invest earnings to achieve goals more effectively.

As a result, strategic management helps keep a firm profitable and stable by sticking to its long-run plan. Strategic management not only sets company targets but sets guidelines for achieving those objectives even as challenges appear along the way. What Is the Scope of Strategic Financial Management? Strategic management can encompass all aspects of a firm's long-term objectives. Financial management often plays a key role in this, which involves cost reduction, risk management, and budgeting.

The value mindset The first step in VBM is embracing value maximization as the ultimate financial objective for a company. Traditional financial performance measures, such as earnings or earnings growth, are not always good proxies for value creation.

Explain to a third-grader: what dna changes produce the delta f508 mutation,ETA3G,"""The commonest polymorphism is the seven thymidine (7T) variant and the delta F508 mutation occurs exclusively on the 9T variant""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Over one thousand different mutant alleles of CFTR have been described. Any mutation that prevents CFTR from sufficiently transporting ions can lead to cystic fibrosis (CF). Worldwide, the most common CFTR allele among CF patients is called ΔF508 (delta-F508 or PHE508DEL), which is a deletion of three nucleotides that eliminates a phenylalanine (F) from position 508 of the 1480 amino acid wild-type protein. Mutation ΔF508 causes CFTR to be folded improperly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preventing CFTR from reaching the cell membrane. The allele ΔF508 accounts for approximately 70% of CF cases in North America, with ~1/25 people of European descent being carriers. The high frequency of the ΔF508 allele around the world has led to speculation that it may confer some selective advantage to heterozygotes, perhaps by reducing dehydration during cholera epidemics or by reducing susceptibility to certain pathogens that bind to epithelial membranes, although little data has been uncovered to support these hypotheses. However, recent mining of health data and genetic data from over 19,000 CFTR mutant allele heterozygotes suggests that heterozygotes exhibit an increased incidence of a variety of conditions including infertility, pancreatitis, diabetes, short stature, failure to thrive, constipation and scoliosis (Miller et al., 2020). </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> The most common mutation worldwide is delta F508, which occurs in 75% of patients with CF in the UK. A three base-pair deletion in exon 10 of the CFTR gene results in the omission of phenylalanine (one of the bricks) at position 508 in the 1480 amino acid chain. A mutant CFTR protein which cannot be folded into its proper shape is produced. The quality control mechanisms within the cell destroy this abnormal protein before it can reach the cell surface where its major normal function is to act as a channel through which chloride ions can pass in and out of the cell. In other ethnic groups the range of mutations are different e.g. in Ashkenazi Jews delta F508 accounts for 27% and W1282X for 51% of the mutations (Kalman et al, 1994). Mode of inheritance and risk of passing on the CF gene </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The commonest polymorphism is the seven thymidine (7T) variant and the delta F508 mutation occurs exclusively on the 9T variant. This variation may be important in some CFTR mutations e.g. R117H. The presence of R117H/delta F508 on a background of 5T is associated with an elevated sweat test and clinical CF. R117H in association with 7T may result in normal, borderline or elevated sweat values and a variable clinical presentation (Kiesewetter et al, 1993; Rave-Harel et al, 1997; Massie et al, 2001; Peckham et al, 2006). Genotyping </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The CFTR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at position q31.2 [9]. To date, over 1,900 sequence variations in the CFTR gene have been reported [10], although a detailed understanding of how CFTR mutations impact channel dysfunction is limited to a only a few of these [11]. This implies a relatively small list of well-defined CFTR mutations known to be CF disease causing, whereas the functional consequence of various rare sequence variations remains unknown or has been shown not to be CF disease causing [12]. The majority of identified CFTR gene mutations fall into one of six classes that account for ∼80% of all CF patients [9]. Of the &gt;1,900 CFTR mutations that have been identified so far, approximately only 20 mutations have a frequency &gt;0.1% [9]. In fact, notwithstanding the common F508del variant, only four CFTR mutations have a frequency &gt;0.1%: G551D, W1282X, G542X and N1303K, having a worldwide prevalence of around 1–3% each [9, 11]. F508del is the most common mutation with an allelic frequency of around 90% worldwide [13]. Mutation classification Class I and II CFTR mutations are typically characterised by a reduction in the quantity of expressed CFTR protein (fig. 1). Class I mutations can result from nonsense and frame-shift mutations, as well as mRNA splicing defects [14]. For example, G542X is a nonsense or stop mutation, where introduction of a premature termination codon (or stop codon) results in premature cessation of translation and production of truncated CFTR protein. Class II mutations, including F508del, have folding or maturation defects, which can result in premature CFTR degradation (fig. 1) [9]. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The most common mutation causing CF is a three-base pair deletion in the position of delta F508 (dF508), but there are now over 1800 mutations identified in the CFTR gene. The identification of increased immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in the blood of infants with CF has made neonatal screening for CF possible. Trypsinogen is one of the secretory products of the pancreas making its level in the blood a specific marker of pancreatic function. Detection of high levels of IRT in the newborn period place the infant at risk for CF.  Although there is no cure, newborns screened for cystic fibrosis can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment, which can: Improve growth Improve lung function Reduce hospital stays Add years to life </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The three mutations we studied affect approximately 1.5% of individuals with CF and do not disrupt the classical canonical splicing regions [20], rather they cause CF by creating strong alternative splice sites which result in formation of pseudoexons or extend existing exons in CFTR. The first mutation, c.1679+1634A&gt;G, creates a very strong splice acceptor in intron 12 of CFTR with 99% of transcripts containing a 49bp pseudoexon with an in-frame TAA stop codon in the pseudoexon causing premature termination of the CFTR protein [21], and is classified as a severe CF-causing mutation. The second, c.3140-26A&gt;G, creates a splice acceptor site 26 bp before exon 20 and therefore extends this exon by 25bp [22]. The resultant frameshift leads to premature termination of CFTR at a TGA stop codon. Whilst c.3140-26A&gt;G disrupts 95% of CFTR transcripts, the production of ~5% normal transcripts is thought to explain the milder CF phenotype observed in individuals with this mutation. The final mutation, c.3718-2477C&gt;T, creates a splice donor deep within intron 22 and leads to inclusion of an 84 bp pseudoexon (which contains an in-frame TAA stop codon) into the mRNA [23]. For individuals with c.3718-2477C&gt;T, the 10th most common CF allele [5], a wide range of aberrant splicing has been reported, with a strong correlation between the level of mis-splicing and severity of disease [24–26]. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The common delta F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interferes with the biosynthetic folding of nascent CFTR polypeptides, leading to their retention and rapid degradation in an intracellular compartment proximal to the Golgi apparatus. Neither the pathway by which wild-type CFTR folds nor the mechanism by which the Phe508 deletion interferes with this process is well understood. We have investigated the effect of glycerol, a polyhydric alcohol known to stabilize protein conformation, on the folding of CFTR and delta F508 in vivo. Incubation of transient and stable delta F508 transfectants with 10% glycerol induced a significant accumulation of delta F508 protein bearing complex N-linked oligosaccharides, indicative of their transit to a compartment distal to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This accumulation was accompanied by an increase in mean whole cell cAMP activated chloride conductance, suggesting that the glycerol-rescued delta F508 polypeptides form functional plasma membrane CFTR channels. These effects were dose- and time-dependent and fully reversible. Glycerol treatment also stabilized immature (core-glycosylated) delta F508 and CFTR molecules that are normally degraded rapidly. These effects of glycerol were not due to a general disruption of ER quality control processes but appeared to correlate with the degree of temperature sensitivity of specific CFTR mutations. These data suggest a model in which glycerol serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and subsequent release from the ER quality control apparatus. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Not only is there heterogeneity in the mutations causing Cystic Fibrosis, but the pathogenetic mechanisms also vary. Deletion of phenylalanine-508 appears to cause disease by abrogating normal biosynthetic processing and thereby resulting in retention and degradation of the mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations, such as the relatively common G551D mutation [4], appear to be normally processed and, therefore, must cause disease through some other mechanism. G551D mutation, which is within the first nucleotide-binding fold of the CFTR, is the third most common CF mutation, with a worldwide frequency of 3.1% among CF chromosomes [5]. Several mutations result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced [6]. </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> The most common CF mutation, F508del, is primarily considered to be a processing mutation. The F508del mutation removes a single amino acid from the CFTR protein. Without this building block, the CFTR protein cannot stay in the correct 3-D shape. The cell recognizes that the protein isn't the right shape and disposes of it. The drug combination Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) works by enabling CFTR protein with an F508del mutation to fold in a more correct shape, and then activates the protein to allow more chloride to pass through. Although this drug combination is not a perfect fix, it helps the mutant CFTR protein to move some chloride. This movement of chloride reduces the symptoms of CF. Watch the webcast (starting at 3:02) to learn more about CF protein processing mutations and how drugs such as CFTR modulators can help a person with one of these mutations. </p>",2025-11-20 15:14:57-08:00,False,Response is valid.

These data suggest a model in which glycerol serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and subsequent release from the ER quality control apparatus. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Not only is there heterogeneity in the mutations causing Cystic Fibrosis, but the pathogenetic mechanisms also vary. Deletion of phenylalanine-508 appears to cause disease by abrogating normal biosynthetic processing and thereby resulting in retention and degradation of the mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations, such as the relatively common G551D mutation [4], appear to be normally processed and, therefore, must cause disease through some other mechanism. G551D mutation, which is within the first nucleotide-binding fold of the CFTR, is the third most common CF mutation, with a worldwide frequency of 3.1% among CF chromosomes [5]. Several mutations result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced [6]. </p><p><b>Source 9:</b> The most common CF mutation, F508del, is primarily considered to be a processing mutation. The F508del mutation removes a single amino acid from the CFTR protein. Without this building block, the CFTR protein cannot stay in the correct 3-D shape. The cell recognizes that the protein isn't the right shape and disposes of it. The drug combination Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) works by enabling CFTR protein with an F508del mutation to fold in a more correct shape, and then activates the protein to allow more chloride to pass through. Although this drug combination is not a perfect fix, it helps the mutant CFTR protein to move some chloride. This movement of chloride reduces the symptoms of CF. Watch the webcast (starting at 3:02) to learn more about CF protein processing mutations and how drugs such as CFTR modulators can help a person with one of these mutations. </p>",2025-11-22 05:28:40-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Valentine & Moores 1970 were probably the first to recognise a Precambrian supercontinent, which they named 'Pangaea I.' It was renamed 'Rodinia' by McMenamin & McMenamin 1990 who also were the first to produce a reconstruction and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent. Rodinia formed at c. 1.23 Ga by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent, Columbia, assembled by global-scale 2.0–1.8 Ga collisional events. Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic with its continental fragments reassembled to form Pannotia 633–573 Ma. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known about the configuration and geodynamic history of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the Earth's crust but not to their longitude, which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed. The extreme cooling of the global climate around 717–635 Ma (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes.

Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the late Proterozoic and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent 'Paleopangaea' supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 Ma and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 Ma. This latter solution predicts that break-up was confined to the Ediacaran period and produced the dramatic environmental changes that characterised the transition between the Precambrian and Phanerozoic. However, this theory has been widely criticized, as incorrect applications of paleomagnetic data have been pointed out. Breakup In 2009 UNESCO's International Geoscience Programme project 440, named 'Rodinia Assembly and Breakup,' concluded that Rodinia broke up in four stages between 825 and 550 Ma: The breakup was initiated by a superplume around 825–800 Ma whose influence—such as crustal arching, intense bimodal magmatism, and accumulation of thick rift-type sedimentary successions—has been recorded in South Australia, South China, Tarim, Kalahari, India, and the Arabian-Nubian Craton.

The formation of Pangaea had significant impacts on Earth's climate and biota: It created vast deserts in the center of the continent due to its distance from the ocean, while coastal areas experienced humid climates.

Geologists proposed the concept of Pannotia in the early 1990s based on geological and paleomagnetic evidence. Pannotia was at the South Pole, and a global ocean, which had surrounded the earlier Rodinia, enclosed the landmass, which is how it first formed. The supercontinent consisted of present-day South America, Arabia, Antarctica, Australia, and parts of Asia. The breakup of Pannotia contributed to the formation of new oceans, such as the Iapetus Ocean and the Proto-Tethys Ocean.

John Goodge, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Rodinia was another supercontinent that existed approximately 1.1 billion years ago during the Neoproterozoic era. It was another potential precursor to the better-known Pangea. The continent formed through collisions between smaller land masses, eventually covering almost one-third of the planet's surface. It was one of the first Precambrian supercontinents identified and was named Pangaea I at first. The vast landmass altered ocean currents, leading to changes in sea level and weather patterns. The continent also provided new habitats for early life forms, allowing for diversification and evolution.

The formation of Pangaea had significant impacts on Earth's climate and biota: It created vast deserts in the center of the continent due to its distance from the ocean, while coastal areas experienced humid climates.

Geologists proposed the concept of Pannotia in the early 1990s based on geological and paleomagnetic evidence. Pannotia was at the South Pole, and a global ocean, which had surrounded the earlier Rodinia, enclosed the landmass, which is how it first formed. The supercontinent consisted of present-day South America, Arabia, Antarctica, Australia, and parts of Asia. The breakup of Pannotia contributed to the formation of new oceans, such as the Iapetus Ocean and the Proto-Tethys Ocean.

John Goodge, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Rodinia was another supercontinent that existed approximately 1.1 billion years ago during the Neoproterozoic era. It was another potential precursor to the better-known Pangea. The continent formed through collisions between smaller land masses, eventually covering almost one-third of the planet's surface. It was one of the first Precambrian supercontinents identified and was named Pangaea I at first. The vast landmass altered ocean currents, leading to changes in sea level and weather patterns.

Explain to a third-grader: what is the difference between pangea and rodinia,ETA3G,"""Pangaea was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, approximately 336 million years ago.""""Rodinia, a Russian term for 'motherland,' was the next older supercontinent; it came together about 1 billion years ago and rifted apart about 750 million years ago.""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> Rodinia (from the Russian родина, rodina, meaning 'motherland, birthplace') was a Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic supercontinent that assembled 1.26–0.90 billion years ago (Ga) and broke up 750–633 million years ago (Ma). Valentine & Moores 1970 were probably the first to recognise a Precambrian supercontinent, which they named 'Pangaea I.' It was renamed 'Rodinia' by McMenamin & McMenamin 1990 who also were the first to produce a reconstruction and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent. Rodinia formed at c. 1.23 Ga by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent, Columbia, assembled by global-scale 2.0–1.8 Ga collisional events. Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic with its continental fragments reassembled to form Pannotia 633–573 Ma. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known about the configuration and geodynamic history of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the Earth's crust but not to their longitude, which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed. The extreme cooling of the global climate around 717–635 Ma (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes. Geodynamics Paleogeographic reconstructions Rodinia at 900 Ma. 'Consensus' reconstruction of Li et al. 2008. The idea that a supercontinent existed in the early Neoproterozoic arose in the 1970s, when geologists determined that orogens of this age exist on virtually all cratons.[failed verification] Examples are the Grenville orogeny in North America and the Dalslandian orogeny in Europe. Since then, many alternative reconstructions have been proposed for the configuration of the cratons in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different cratons. Though the configuration of the core cratons in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data. Life timelineThis box: Most reconstructions show Rodinia's core formed by the North American Craton (the later paleocontinent of Laurentia), surrounded in the southeast with the East European Craton (the later paleocontinent of Baltica), the Amazonian Craton and the West African Craton; in the south with the Río de la Plata and São Francisco cratons; in the southwest with the Congo and Kalahari cratons; and in the northeast with Australia, India and eastern Antarctica. The positions of Siberia and North and South China north of the North American craton differ strongly depending on the reconstruction: SWEAT-Configuration (Southwest US-East Antarctica craton): Antarctica is southwest of Laurentia, and Australia is north of Antarctica. AUSWUS-Configuration (Australia-western US): Australia is west of Laurentia. AUSMEX-Configuration (Australia-Mexico): Australia is at the location of current day Mexico relative to Laurentia. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> According to J.D.A. Piper, Rodinia is one of two models for the configuration and history of the continental crust in the latter part of Precambrian times. The other is Paleopangea, Piper's own concept. Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the late Proterozoic and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent 'Paleopangaea' supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 Ma and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 Ma. This latter solution predicts that break-up was confined to the Ediacaran period and produced the dramatic environmental changes that characterised the transition between the Precambrian and Phanerozoic. However, this theory has been widely criticized, as incorrect applications of paleomagnetic data have been pointed out. Breakup In 2009 UNESCO's International Geoscience Programme project 440, named 'Rodinia Assembly and Breakup,' concluded that Rodinia broke up in four stages between 825 and 550 Ma: The breakup was initiated by a superplume around 825–800 Ma whose influence—such as crustal arching, intense bimodal magmatism, and accumulation of thick rift-type sedimentary successions—has been recorded in South Australia, South China, Tarim, Kalahari, India, and the Arabian-Nubian Craton. Rifting progressed in the same cratons 800–750 Ma and spread into Laurentia and perhaps Siberia. India (including Madagascar) and the Congo–São Francisco Craton were either detached from Rodinia during this period or simply never were part of the supercontinent. As the central part of Rodinia reached the Equator around 750–700 Ma, a new pulse of magmatism and rifting continued the disassembly in western Kalahari, West Australia, South China, Tarim, and most margins of Laurentia. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Rodinia, a Russian term for 'motherland,' was the next older supercontinent; it came together about 1 billion years ago and rifted apart about 750 million years ago. Its existence is well agreed upon, but its configuration has been controversial for more than two decades. The scientists noticed that the Tasmanian Rocky Cape Group and Grand Canyon's Unkar Group have uncanny bed-by-bed similarity. Credit: University of New Mexico 'We started this work by looking at Mesoproterozoic (~1 billion years old) sedimentary rocks in Tasmania, a small island off southeast Australia,' said Mulder. 'These rocks had puzzled us for a long time because they didn't look a lot like the nearby Mesoproterozoic rocks in Australia. We wanted to know where the ancient sedimentary rocks in Tasmania were sourced from so we analysed sand-sized grains of the mineral zircon, which makes up a small proportion of the sedimentary rocks.' </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Pangaea was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, approximately 336 million years ago.

It began trading stock as a publicly held company on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The first stock split occurred in May 1971 for $47 per share. By this time, Wal-Mart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As the company moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125 stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of $340.3 million. Wal-Mart logo from 1981 to 1992 In the 1980s, Wal-Mart briefly experimented with a precursor to the Supercenter, the Hyper-Mart. Four stores combined features of discount stores, supermarkets, pharmacies, video arcades, and other amenities. Wal-Mart continued to grow rapidly, and by the company's 25th anniversary in 1987, there were 1,198 Wal-Mart stores with sales of $15.9 billion and 200,000 associates. One reason for Wal-Mart's success between 1980 and 2000 is believed to be its contiguous pattern of expansion over time, building new distribution centers in a hub and spoke framework within driving distance of existing Supercenters. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> While it was the third-largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart was more profitable than rivals Kmart and Sears by the late 1980s. By 1990, it became the largest U.S. retailer by revenue. Prior to the summer of 1990, Wal-Mart had no presence on the West Coast or in the Northeast (except for a single Sam's Club in New Jersey which opened in November 1989), but in July and October that year, it opened its first stores in California and Pennsylvania, respectively. By the mid-1990s, it was the most powerful retailer in the U.S. and expanded into Mexico in 1991 and Canada in 1994. Wal-Mart stores opened throughout the rest of the U.S., with Vermont being the last state to get a store in 1995. The company also opened stores outside North America, entering South America in 1995 with stores in Argentina and Brazil; and Europe in July 1999, buying Asda in the United Kingdom for US$10 billion. In 1997, Wal-Mart was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In 1998, Wal-Mart introduced the Neighborhood Market concept with three stores in Arkansas. By 2005, estimates indicate that the company controlled about 20 percent of the retail grocery and consumables business. In 2000, H. Lee Scott became Wal-Mart's president and CEO as the company's sales increased to $165 billion. In 2002, it was listed for the first time as America's largest corporation on the Fortune 500 list, with revenues of $219.8 billion and profits of $6.7 billion. It has remained there every year except 2006, 2009, and 2012. In 2005, Wal-Mart reported US$312.4 billion in sales, more than 6,200 facilities around the world—including 3,800 stores in the United States and 2,800 elsewhere, employing more than 1.6 million associates. Its U.S. presence grew so rapidly that only small pockets of the country remained more than 60 miles (97 kilometers) from the nearest store. </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Walmart is headquartered in the Walmart Home Office complex in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company's business model is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at low prices. Doug McMillon became Walmart's CEO on February 1, 2014. He has also worked as the head of Sam's Club and Walmart International. The company refers to its employees as 'associates'. All Walmart stores in the U.S. and Canada also have designated 'greeters' at the entrance, a practice pioneered by Sam Walton and later imitated by other retailers. Greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> In the beginning, Walmart founder Sam Walton knew what it would take to get products on the shelves of his store at low prices. In fact, he was known for purchasing bulk merchandise on his own and having it transported directly to his stores for resale. Talk about taking the initiative. Over time, however, as the company began to grow and demands for products increased, Walmart had to develop a better system for stocking products on its shelves. In the 1980s, Walmart effectively cut out the middleman and began dealing with manufacturers rather than distributors (read our article on the differences between manufacturing vs. distribution for more) directly so that it could cut costs and more efficiently manage and overcome supply chain issues and challenges. All while keeping 'everyday low prices'. In short, Walmart went straight to the source and offered guaranteed, consistent business to vendors themselves in exchange for low, wholesale prices. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> Walmart is a multinational giant corporation that operates retail stores in the form of hypermarkets. It was founded in 1962 by Sam Walton. Today the company has more than 10,000 stores and clubs in 24 countries. The Walton family controls the company. The billionaires of the Walton family include Jim Walton, Alice Walton, S. Robson Walton, Lukas Walton, Ann Walton Kroenke, Nancy Walton Laurie and Christy Walton. Walmart's Marketing strategy makes it successful in the competitive retail business. The competition in the retail business is immense, and many companies have failed to survive in this business. Walmart's marketing strategy has also helped the company to face the onslaught of the e-commerce giant Amazon. The way Walmart is run is stable because of its management procedures. The Walmart Marketing Mix is why the big store has been so successful.

Personal jurisdiction is the requirement that a given court have power over the defendant, based on minimum contacts with the forum. Subject-matter jurisdiction is the requirement that a given court have power to hear the specific kind of claim that is brought to that court. While litigating parties may waive personal jurisdiction, they cannot waive subject-matter jurisdiction. In federal court, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is considered a favored defense and may be raised at any point in the litigation process, even if the parties had previously argued that subject-matter jurisdiction existed. In fact, the court may dismiss a case sua sponte (on its own) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1). General and Limited Jurisdiction </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> The two primary sources of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts are diversity jurisdiction and federal question jurisdiction. Diversity jurisdiction generally permits individuals to bring claims in federal court where the claim exceeds $75,000 and the parties are citizens of different states. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. So, if a citizen of New York sues a citizen of California for more than $75,000, a federal court would have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear that claim. Under federal question jurisdiction, a litigant—regardless of the value of the claim—may bring a claim in federal court if it arises under federal law, including the U.S. Constitution. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Federal question jurisdiction requires that the federal element appears on the face of a well-plead complaint, is a substantial component of the complainant's claim, and is of significant federal interest. Federal question subject-matter jurisdiction is frequently derived from federal statutes granting a cause of action to parties who have suffered a particular injury. Furthermore, it is important to note that 28 U.S.C. § 1367 provides for supplemental jurisdiction in federal courts. Supplemental jurisdiction allows a federal court to adjudicate a claim over which it does not have independent subject-matter jurisdiction, on the basis that the claim is related to a claim over which the federal court does have independent jurisdiction. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Because the question of whether a tribal court can exercise civil jurisdiction is a question of federal law,(5) and the Supreme Court has recognized that Congress has plenary authority(6) over Indian affairs, Congress has enacted legislation which vests tribal courts with jurisdiction in certain cases, and deprives them of jurisdiction in others. Examples of delegated tribal court civil jurisdiction include: 1) exclusive jurisdiction to foreclose mortgages held by a private lender on Indian trust land, see 25 U.S.C. 483A; 2) exclusive jurisdiction over child custody proceedings involving Indian children residing in Indian country and concurrent jurisdiction over those proceedings when the child resides off under the Indian Child Welfare Act, see 25 U.S.C.1911; 3) concurrent jurisdiction, with state governments, to regulate liquor distribution within Indian country and resulting tribal court authority to enforce regulations, see City of Timber Lake v.

Explain to a third-grader: deep water fishing boat with many baited hooks,ETA3G,"""On deep water trips, I tell my fishing buddies to bring three outfits: one 40-pound outfit and two 50-pound outfits—and all with braid backing and short 50- to 75-foot monofilament top shots""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> With rod in hand, I allow the fish to swim freely a few more seconds. Then, with a subtle 'click,' I close the bail, put the reel in gear and stop the fugitive before it strips me of both line and bait. The fish hits the tight line like a dog reaching the end of its leash, bending my rod into a deep arch. The resistance pushes the circle hook through the fish's jaw, and the battle begins. Three minutes later, I land a fat 5-pound 'Mack' — not huge, but a terrific way to kick off this outing. Karen Krueger proudly displays her first Lake Granby lake trout. Photo by Jerry Neal/CPW. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> When I can find them, I prefer small, 4- to 6-inch minnows or chubs. My favorite technique is to fish these whole, threading a size 5/0 or 6/0 snelled saltwater circle hook through the minnow's body from head to tail (see photo slideshow below). Once the hook is threaded, I attach the snell (loop end) of the hook to the main line with a snap swivel. The benefit of fishing with whole minnows is that they cast well and sink to the bottom without adding lead weight to the line. This allows the minnow to move naturally in the current, closely mimicking a dead baitfish. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column. This can be at the surface or at the bottom. Lines can also be set by means of an anchor, or left to drift. Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line. This can lead to many deaths of different marine species (see bycatch). Longliners – fishing vessels rigged for longlining – commonly target swordfish, tuna, halibut, sablefish and many other species. In some unstable fisheries, such as the Patagonian toothfish, fishermen may be limited to as few as 25 hooks per line. In contrast, commercial longliners in certain robust fisheries of the Bering Sea and North Pacific generally run over 2,500 hand-baited hooks on a single series of connected lines many miles in length. Longlines can be set to hang near the surface (pelagic longline) to catch fish such as tuna and swordfish or along the sea floor (demersal longline) for groundfish such as halibut or cod. Longliners fishing for sablefish, also referred to as black cod, occasionally set gear on the sea floor at depths exceeding 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) using relatively simple equipment. Longlines with traps attached rather than hooks can be used for crab fishing in deep waters. Longline fishing is prone to the incidental catching and killing of dolphins, seabirds, sea turtles, and sharks, but less so than deep sea trawling. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Slowly circling the corner of the ridge, I started seeing clouds of bait right off the bottom. As soon as the bait marks ended, I marked our first yellowtail on the sounder and quickly put the throttle in reverse and bumped the boat back five yards. I then hit the MOB (man overboard button) and grabbed my jig outfit. My friends had already reached bottom by the time I was at the rail, and eight cranks off the bottom the first blue/white Salas 6x was stopped in its tracks–'Fish on!' After a short pause, the heavy tail beat and bend of the rod confirmed we found what we were looking for–big wintertime yellows.

Sure, you can occasionally land a big one on light tackle, but if you really want to land these deep water fish leave your light tackle at home. I don't recommend fishing anything less than 30-pound test line if you want to land a couple fish. The fishing techniques are very basic–you will be either fishing the yo-yo jigs (more on this later) or a dropper loop rig with a live mackerel or sardine.

Then, with a subtle 'click,' I close the bail, put the reel in gear and stop the fugitive before it strips me of both line and bait. The fish hits the tight line like a dog reaching the end of its leash, bending my rod into a deep arch. The resistance pushes the circle hook through the fish's jaw, and the battle begins. Three minutes later, I land a fat 5-pound 'Mack' — not huge, but a terrific way to kick off this outing. Karen Krueger proudly displays her first Lake Granby lake trout. Photo by Jerry Neal/CPW. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> When I can find them, I prefer small, 4- to 6-inch minnows or chubs. My favorite technique is to fish these whole, threading a size 5/0 or 6/0 snelled saltwater circle hook through the minnow's body from head to tail (see photo slideshow below). Once the hook is threaded, I attach the snell (loop end) of the hook to the main line with a snap swivel. The benefit of fishing with whole minnows is that they cast well and sink to the bottom without adding lead weight to the line. This allows the minnow to move naturally in the current, closely mimicking a dead baitfish. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column. This can be at the surface or at the bottom. Lines can also be set by means of an anchor, or left to drift. Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line. This can lead to many deaths of different marine species (see bycatch). Longliners – fishing vessels rigged for longlining – commonly target swordfish, tuna, halibut, sablefish and many other species. In some unstable fisheries, such as the Patagonian toothfish, fishermen may be limited to as few as 25 hooks per line. In contrast, commercial longliners in certain robust fisheries of the Bering Sea and North Pacific generally run over 2,500 hand-baited hooks on a single series of connected lines many miles in length. Longlines can be set to hang near the surface (pelagic longline) to catch fish such as tuna and swordfish or along the sea floor (demersal longline) for groundfish such as halibut or cod. Longliners fishing for sablefish, also referred to as black cod, occasionally set gear on the sea floor at depths exceeding 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) using relatively simple equipment. Longlines with traps attached rather than hooks can be used for crab fishing in deep waters. Longline fishing is prone to the incidental catching and killing of dolphins, seabirds, sea turtles, and sharks, but less so than deep sea trawling. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Slowly circling the corner of the ridge, I started seeing clouds of bait right off the bottom. As soon as the bait marks ended, I marked our first yellowtail on the sounder and quickly put the throttle in reverse and bumped the boat back five yards. I then hit the MOB (man overboard button) and grabbed my jig outfit. My friends had already reached bottom by the time I was at the rail, and eight cranks off the bottom the first blue/white Salas 6x was stopped in its tracks–'Fish on!' After a short pause, the heavy tail beat and bend of the rod confirmed we found what we were looking for–big wintertime yellows. Do Your Homework </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> On deep water trips, I tell my fishing buddies to bring three outfits: one 40-pound outfit and two 50-pound outfits—and all with braid backing and short 50- to 75-foot monofilament top shots. Sure, you can occasionally land a big one on light tackle, but if you really want to land these deep water fish leave your light tackle at home. I don't recommend fishing anything less than 30-pound test line if you want to land a couple fish.

Once the tooth enamel has formed, dental fluorosis cannot develop (87). The mildest form of dental fluorosis is detectable only to the trained observer and is characterized by small opaque white flecks or spots on the enamel of the teeth. Moderate dental fluorosis is characterized by mottling and mild staining of the teeth, and severe dental fluorosis results in marked staining and pitting of the teeth. In its moderate to severe forms, dental fluorosis becomes a cosmetic concern when it affects the incisors and canines (front teeth). Dental fluorosis is a dose-dependent condition, with higher fluoride intakes being associated with more pronounced effects on the teeth. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Most toothpaste sold in the United States contains fluoride in the form of sodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate, most commonly at a level of 1,000 to 1,100 mg/L (about 1.3 mg in a quarter teaspoon, a typical amount of toothpaste used for one brushing) [3]. The amount of fluoride ingested from toothpaste depends on the amount used, the person's swallowing control, and how often the person uses toothpaste. Estimated typical amounts of fluoride ingested daily from toothpaste are 0.1 mg to 0.25 mg for infants and children age 0 to 5 years, 0.2 to 0.3 mg for children age 6 to 12 years, and 0.1 mg for adults [3].

Over time, that strength helps fight tooth decay that occurs during eating. While fluoride has proven benefits for dental health, there is such a thing as too much fluoride—particularly for children. One common problem associated with too much fluoride is fluorosis, a condition that causes a range of changes to the appearance of tooth enamel, from little white spots to brown stains or even a rough, sanded-away appearance on the tooth surface.

Fluoride works to control early dental caries in several ways. Fluoride concentrated in plaque and saliva inhibits the demineralization of sound enamel and enhances the remineralization (i.e., recovery) of demineralized enamel (12,13). As cariogenic bacteria metabolize carbohydrates and produce acid, fluoride is released from dental plaque in response to lowered pH at the tooth-plaque interface (14). The released fluoride and the fluoride present in saliva are then taken up, along with calcium and phosphate, by de-mineralized enamel to establish an improved enamel crystal structure. This improved structure is more acid resistant and contains more fluoride and less carbonate (12,15--19) (Figure 1). Fluoride is more readily taken up by demineralized enamel than by sound enamel (20).

Applying fluoride gel or other products containing a high concentration of fluoride to the teeth leaves a temporary layer of calcium fluoride-like material on the enamel surface. The fluoride in this material is released when the pH drops in the mouth in response to acid production and is available to remineralize enamel (29).

Based on the best-selling book series by L.J. Smith, The Vampire Diaries was developed for the small screen by Dawson's Creek creator Kevin Williamson with his long-time collaborator Julie Plec and premiered on The CW in 2009. Set in the picturesque, but paranormal town of Mystic Falls, the long-running series focused on the vampire love triangle between protagonists Elena (Nina Dobrev), Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) and his brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder), alongside the town's other human and not-so-human inhabitants. The Vampire Diaries spawned not one, but two spinoffs – The Originals and Legacies – and developed a loyal fan following over its eight seasons on the air. The show enjoyed a good run and its season 8 finale wrapped up most of its unresolved storylines nicely in an epic episode that featured some major character deaths and a few happy endings. Related: Preacher Finally Reveals How Cassidy Became A Vampire Despite its satisfying finale fans of the show still hope another season might be on the cards, but could The Vampire Diaries season 9 ever happen? The CW Canceled The Vampire Diaries In 2017 Just a few months after The CW renewed the show for its eighth season, showrunner Julie Plec announced The Vampire Diaries would end with season 8, feeling the show had come to a natural end. Fans may have been disappointed then, but the knowledge that season 8 would be the show's last allowed its makers to craft a final season that tied up loose ends and bid a proper farewell to its characters. The Vampire Diaries Season 9 Isn't Likely Star Ian Somerhalder has stated several times he feels The Vampire Diaries chapter of his career is closed and seeing as Nina Dobrev left the show in season 6 and only returned for the finale, it doesn't seem likely she'd be interested in filming a ninth season. More recently, Somerhalder appeared on Andy Cohen Live and seemed to lay the rumors to rest regarding his and Dobrev's return for a season 9. In his words: 'I have not heard anything about a season nine…I mean, like, what would happen? Stefan and Damon…Damon has, like, gray hair and…they have canes?... Listen, it ran a great course and now it's still living. That's what's so amazing. It's still living.' </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Based on the book series by L. J. Smith, the fan-favorite series aired from 2009 to 2017 and starred Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley, Candice King, Steven R. McQueen, Ian Somerhalder, Kat Graham, Zach Roerig, Michael Trevino and Matthew Davis. Throughout its reign on The CW, The Vampire Diaries' success spawned two spinoff series, The Originals and Legacies. While the original stars have since moved on from their time in the fictional supernatural town, is there any chance for some of them to return?

Based on the best-selling book series by L.J. Smith, The Vampire Diaries was developed for the small screen by Dawson's Creek creator Kevin Williamson with his long-time collaborator Julie Plec and premiered on The CW in 2009. Set in the picturesque, but paranormal town of Mystic Falls, the long-running series focused on the vampire love triangle between protagonists Elena (Nina Dobrev), Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) and his brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder), alongside the town's other human and not-so-human inhabitants. The Vampire Diaries spawned not one, but two spinoffs – The Originals and Legacies – and developed a loyal fan following over its eight seasons on the air. The show enjoyed a good run and its season 8 finale wrapped up most of its unresolved storylines nicely in an epic episode that featured some major character deaths and a few happy endings.

So, I can take almost all of this song literally. 'I have died every day waiting for you.' I waited, and waited, for six years to meet the love of my life, with a lot of judgment and disapproval from the people around me...it was incredibly difficult, but I knew what I wanted. There was no one else. Never anyone else, for either of us. Sounds hard to believe, I know, and I can't explain why other than that we just KNEW, somehow, that we were meant for each other. 'All along, I believed I would find you.' I did. He did, too. We always knew we would be together someday, whenever it was feasible. 'Time has brought your heart to me.' It really did. After all that waiting, the time was worth it. Every day, every month, every year. Worth everything for what I have now. Anyway, that's my sentiment take on this song. It's beautiful. Reminds me of my relationship. My relationship began online 9 years ago. He lived halfway across the world, and for many years, it was impossible for him to move here to be with me.

Think back to the first time you heard Aerosmith's 'Don't Want to Miss a Thing' or how you felt when Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' first played on the radio. These records not only represent an era of timeless hits, but also sparked a generation of unforgettable wedding music we all know and love. Today, romantic tracks have moved past the formula of soft ballads, and can now be heard in a variety of genres like indie, pop, and more upbeat R&B tunes. Regardless of the song's tempo, though, it's the lyrics that truly make a song memorable and worthy to be played on a couple's special day. Just look at the last 62 years of hits, and you'll find evidence of lyrics of love sprinkled throughout almost every wedding day celebration. </p><p><b>Source 8:</b> Quote by George R.R.

There was no one else. Never anyone else, for either of us. Sounds hard to believe, I know, and I can't explain why other than that we just KNEW, somehow, that we were meant for each other. 'All along, I believed I would find you.' I did. He did, too. We always knew we would be together someday, whenever it was feasible. 'Time has brought your heart to me.' It really did. After all that waiting, the time was worth it. Every day, every month, every year. Worth everything for what I have now. Anyway, that's my sentiment take on this song. It's beautiful. Reminds me of my relationship. My relationship began online 9 years ago. He lived halfway across the world, and for many years, it was impossible for him to move here to be with me. We carried on an online romance for 6 years before he finally came here so we could be together. It's been three years since then, and today we live together and love each other more than ever. </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> Despite countless classics that top the charts, there are several songs that get etched in history as romantic masterpieces.

Beloved readers, these structural differences may seem minor on paper, yet their impacts are deeply felt in the life and governance of each church.

How are Episcopal and Catholic views on social issues different? </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> The chair (cathedra) of the Bishop of Rome (Pope) of the Catholic Church in the Archbasilica of St. John in Lateran in Rome, Italy, represents his episcopal authority. An episcopal polity is a hierarchical form of church governance ('ecclesiastical polity') in which the chief local authorities are called bishops. The word 'bishop' here is derived via the British Latin and Vulgar Latin term *ebiscopus/*biscopus, from the Ancient Greek ἐπίσκοπος epískopos meaning 'overseer'. It is the structure used by many of the major Christian Churches and denominations, such as the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Anabaptist, Lutheran, and Anglican churches or denominations, and other churches founded independently from these lineages.[citation needed] Many Methodist denominations have a form of episcopal polity known as connexionalism. History Bishops are considered to derive their authority from an unbroken, personal apostolic succession from the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Bishops with such authority are said to represent the historical episcopate or historic episcopate. Churches with this type of government usually believe that the Church requires episcopal government as described in the New Testament (see 1 Timothy 3 and 2 Timothy 1). In some systems, bishops may be subject in limited ways to bishops holding a higher office (variously called archbishops, metropolitans, or patriarchs, depending upon the tradition). They also meet in councils or synods. These gatherings, subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops, usually make important decisions, though the synod or council may also be purely advisory. For much of the written history of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the Reformation. Many Protestant churches are now organized by either congregational or presbyterian church polities, both descended from the writings of John Calvin, a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the Catholic Church precipitated by The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther. However, some people have disputed the episcopal polity before the reformation, such as Aerius of Sebaste in the 4th century. Overview of episcopal churches The government of a bishop is typically symbolized by a cathedral church, such as the bishops's see at Chartres Cathedral. The definition of the word episcopal has variation among Christian traditions. There are subtle differences in governmental principles among episcopal churches at the present time. To some extent the separation of episcopal churches can be traced to these differences in ecclesiology, that is, their theological understanding of church and church governance. For some, 'episcopal churches' are churches that use a hierarchy of bishops who identify as being in an unbroken, personal apostolic succession. 'Episcopal' is also commonly used to distinguish between the various organizational structures of denominations. For instance, 'Presbyterian' (Greek: πρεσβύτερος, presbýteros) is used to describe a church governed by a hierarchy of assemblies of elected elders, referred to as presbyterian polity. Similarly, 'episcopal' is used to describe a church governed by bishops. Self-governed local congregations, governed neither by elders nor bishops, are usually described as 'congregational'. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The conciliar idea of episcopal government continues in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In Eastern Orthodoxy, all autocephalous primates are seen as collectively gathering around Christ, with other archbishops and bishops gathering around them, and so forth. There is no single primate with exclusive authority comparable to the Pope in Rome. However, the Patriarch of Constantinople (now Istanbul) is seen as the primus inter pares, the 'first among equals' of the autocephalous churches of Eastern Orthodoxy. Oriental Orthodox churches </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> Functionally, Anglican episcopal authority is expressed synodically, although individual provinces may accord their primate with more or less authority to act independently. Called variously 'synods', 'councils', or 'conventions', they meet under episcopal chairmanship. In many jurisdictions, conciliar resolutions that have been passed require episcopal assent or consent to take force. Seen in this way, Anglicans often speak of 'the bishop-in-synod' as the force and authority of episcopal governance. Such conciliar authority extends to the standard areas of doctrine, discipline, and worship, but in these regards is limited by Anglicanism's tradition of the limits of authority. Those limits are expressed in Article XXI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, ratified in 1571 (significantly, just as the Council of Trent was drawing to a close), which held that 'General Councils ... may err, and sometimes have erred ... wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture.' Hence, Anglican jurisdictions have traditionally been conservative in their approach to either innovative doctrinal development or in encompassing actions of the church as doctrinal (see lex orandi, lex credendi). Anglican synodical government, though varied in expression, is characteristically representative. Provinces of the Anglican Communion, their ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses are governed by councils consisting not only of bishops, but also representatives of the presbyterate and laity. There is no international juridical authority in Anglicanism, although the tradition's common experience of episcopacy, symbolised by the historical link with the See of Canterbury, along with a common and complex liturgical tradition, has provided a measure of unity. This has been reinforced by the Lambeth Conferences of Anglican Communion bishops, which first met in 1867. These conferences, though they propose and pass resolutions, are strictly consultative, and the intent of the resolutions is to provide guideposts for Anglican jurisdictions—not direction.

The House may also elect collegial members who are admitted with seat and voice, but no vote. Collegial members are bishops in the Anglican Communion who serve extra-provincial dioceses.

Provinces of the Anglican Communion, their ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses are governed by councils consisting not only of bishops, but also representatives of the presbyterate and laity. There is no international juridical authority in Anglicanism, although the tradition's common experience of episcopacy, symbolised by the historical link with the See of Canterbury, along with a common and complex liturgical tradition, has provided a measure of unity. This has been reinforced by the Lambeth Conferences of Anglican Communion bishops, which first met in 1867. These conferences, though they propose and pass resolutions, are strictly consultative, and the intent of the resolutions is to provide guideposts for Anglican jurisdictions—not direction. The Conferences also express the function of the episcopate to demonstrate the ecumenical and catholic nature of the church. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> The Episcopal Church is governed by a bicameral General Convention, which meets every three years, and by an Executive Council during interim years. The General Convention consists of the House of Bishops and the House of Deputies. The House of Bishops is composed of every bishop with jurisdiction (diocesan bishop), every bishop coadjutor, every suffragan bishop, every retired bishop, every bishop elected to an office created by General Convention, and every bishop who has resigned because of mission strategy – each of whom has a seat and vote. The House may also elect collegial members who are admitted with seat and voice, but no vote. Collegial members are bishops in the Anglican Communion who serve extra-provincial dioceses. The House of Deputies is composed of up to four lay and four clerical deputies from each of the jurisdictions, domestic and overseas, elected in the manner determined by each jurisdiction. </p>",2025-11-22 03:02:58-08:00,False,Response is valid.

Explain to a third-grader: where were the soviet missiles located in cuba,ETA3G,"""Specialists in missile construction, under the guise of machine operators and agricultural specialists, arrived in July""","<p><b>Source 1:</b> In May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles. Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a 'splendid first strike' capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union. The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> In early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro. The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp. The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a 'nuclear umbrella' for attacks upon the island. By May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans 'with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles'.: 29  The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on 4 July and Khrushchev on 7 July. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> Specialists in missile construction, under the guise of machine operators and agricultural specialists, arrived in July. A total of 43,000 foreign troops would ultimately be brought in. Chief Marshal of Artillery Sergei Biryuzov, Head of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that visited Cuba. He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees. The Soviet troops would arrive in Cuba heavily underprepared. They did not know that the tropical climate would render ineffective many of their weapons and much of their equipment. In the first few days of setting up the missiles, troops complained of fuse failures, excessive corrosion, overconsumption of oil, and generator blackouts. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> Missiles reported The missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US. The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles. Only five reports bothered the analysts. They described large trucks passing through towns at night that were carrying very long canvas-covered cylindrical objects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and maneuvering. Defensive missile transporters, it was believed, could make such turns without undue difficulty. The reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed. A U-2 reconnaissance photograph of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles, their transports and tents for fueling and maintenance Aerial confirmation </p><p><b>Source 5:</b> The Cuban Missile Crisis was solved in part by a secret agreement between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. The Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was known to only 9 US officials at the time of its creation in October 1963 and was first officially acknowledged at a conference in Moscow in January 1989 by Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin and Kennedy's speechwriter Theodore Sorensen. In his negotiations with Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed 'within a short time after this crisis was over'.: 222  Under an operation code-named Operation Pot Pie, the removal of the Jupiters from Italy and Turkey began on 1 April, and was completed by 24 April 1963. The initial plans were to recycle the missiles for use in other programs, but NASA and the USAF were not interested in retaining the missile hardware. The missile bodies were destroyed on site, while warheads, guidance packages, and launching equipment worth $14 million were returned to the United States. The dismantling operations were named Pot Pie I for Italy and Pot Pie II for Turkey by the United States Air Force. </p><p><b>Source 6:</b> After the failed U.S. attempt to overthrow the Castro regime in Cuba with the Bay of Pigs invasion, and while the Kennedy administration planned Operation Mongoose, in July 1962 Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev reached a secret agreement with Cuban premier Fidel Castro to place Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba to deter any future invasion attempt. Construction of several missile sites began in the late summer, but U.S. intelligence discovered evidence of a general Soviet arms build-up on Cuba, including Soviet IL–28 bombers, during routine surveillance flights, and on September 4, 1962, President Kennedy issued a public warning against the introduction of offensive weapons into Cuba. Despite the warning, on October 14 a U.S. U–2 aircraft took several pictures clearly showing sites for medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) under construction in Cuba. These images were processed and presented </p><p><b>Source 7:</b> In the early stages of the Cuban missile crisis, this photograph showed that the Soviet Union was amassing offensive ballistic missiles in Cuba.

The worldwide, catastrophic Flood of Noah's day would have destroyed the surface of the earth. If most of the sedimentary strata over the earth's surface (many thousands of feet thick in places) is the result of this global catastrophe as creationists believe, then we would have no idea where the Garden of Eden was originally located—the earth's surface totally changed as a result of the Flood. Not only this, but underneath the region where the present Tigris and Euphrates Rivers are located, there exists hundreds of feet of sedimentary strata—a significant amount of which is fossiliferous. Such fossil-bearing strata had to be laid down at the time of the Flood. </p><p><b>Source 2:</b> Fertile river valleys were cradles to four of the earliest civilizations: the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in South Asia, and the Yangtze and Yellow in China, explained Brown University geographer Laurence Smith.

Rivers also serve as borders in several African countries: Benin, Nigeria, Senegal, Mauritania, and Niger in West Africa; the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, and Mozambique in Central Africa; and Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Namibia in Southern Africa. In Europe, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Poland, Norway, Bosnia, Romania, and Ukraine are just some of the many countries with international border rivers. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The Tigris passes through historical cities like Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad. In ancient times, the Tigris nurtured the Assyrian Empire, with remnants like the relief of King Tiglath-Pileser. The Tigris is home to archaeological sites and ancient religious communities, including the Mandaeans, who use it for baptism. Today, the Tigris faces modern threats from geopolitical instability, dam projects, poor water management, and climate change, leading to concerns about its sustainability. Efforts to protect and preserve the river's legacy are ongoing, with local archaeologists and activists working to safeguard its future. Etymology Bedouin crossing the river Tigris with plunder (c. 1860) The Tigris is 1,750 km (1,090 mi) long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about 25 km (16 mi) southeast of the city of Elazığ and about 30 km (19 mi) from the headwaters of the Euphrates. The river then flows for 400 km (250 mi) through Southeastern Turkey before forming part of the Syria-Turkey border. This stretch of 44 km (27 mi) is the only part of the river that is located in Syria. Some of its affluences are Garzan, Anbarçayi, Batman, and the Great and the Little Zab. Close to its confluence with the Euphrates, the Tigris splits into several channels. First, the artificial Shatt al-Hayy branches off, to join the Euphrates near Nasiriyah. Second, the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir branch off to feed the Central Marshes. Further downstream, two other distributary channels branch off (the Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla), to feed the Hawizeh Marshes. The main channel continues southwards and is joined by the Al-Kassarah, which drains the Hawizeh Marshes. Finally, the Tigris joins the Euphrates near al-Qurnah to form the Shatt-al-Arab. According to Pliny and other ancient historians, the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris. Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, stands on the banks of the Tigris. The port city of Basra straddles the Shatt al-Arab. In ancient times, many of the great cities of Mesopotamia stood on or near the Tigris, drawing water from it to irrigate the civilization of the Sumerians. Notable Tigris-side cities included Nineveh, Ctesiphon, and Seleucia, while the city of Lagash was irrigated by the Tigris via a canal dug around 2900 B.C. Navigation The Tigris has long been an important transport route in a largely desert country. Shallow-draft vessels can go as far as Baghdad, but rafts have historically been needed for transport downstream from Mosul. Management and water quality Batman River The Tigris is heavily dammed in Iraq and Turkey to provide water for irrigating the arid and semi-desert regions bordering the river valley. Damming has also been important for averting floods in Iraq, to which the Tigris has historically been notoriously prone following April melting of snow in the Turkish mountains. Mosul Dam is the largest dam in Iraq. Recent Turkish damming of the river has been the subject of some controversy, for both its environmental effects within Turkey and its potential to reduce the flow of water downstream. Water from both rivers is used as a means of pressure during conflicts. In 2014 a major breakthrough in developing consensus between multiple stakeholder representatives of Iraq and Turkey on a Plan of Action for promoting exchange and calibration of data and standards pertaining to Tigris river flows was achieved. The consensus, known as the 'Geneva Consensus On Tigris River', was reached at a meeting organized in Geneva by the think tank Strategic Foresight Group. In February 2016, the United States Embassy in Iraq as well as the Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi issued warnings that Mosul Dam could collapse. The United States warned people to evacuate the floodplain of the Tigris because between 500,000 and 1.5 million people were at risk of drowning due to flash flood if the dam collapses, and that the major Iraqi cities of Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad were at risk. Religion and mythology In Sumerian mythology, the Tigris was created by the god Enki, who filled the river with flowing water. In Hittite and Hurrian mythology, Aranzah (or Aranzahas in the Hittite nominative form) is the Hurrian name of the Tigris River, which was deified. He was the son of Kumarbi and the brother of Teshub and Tašmišu, one of the three gods spat out of Kumarbi's mouth onto Mount Kanzuras. Later he colluded with Anu and the Teshub to destroy Kumarbi (The Kumarbi Cycle). The Tigris appears twice in the Old Testament. First, in the Book of Genesis, it is the third of the four rivers branching off the river issuing out of the Garden of Eden. The second mention is in the Book of Daniel, wherein Daniel states he received one of his visions 'when I was by that great river the Tigris'. </p>",2025-11-20 15:33:35-08:00,False,Response is valid.

At the same time, rivers have long been used to divide lands. After visiting multiple rivers around the world, Smith became fascinated by the concept of the waterways as political borders. However, he also was surprised to find that little quantitative research on river borders is available—and even less that makes use of modern geospatial mapping techniques. With the help of Sarah Popelka, a student at UCLA, he set out to change that. </p><p><b>Source 3:</b> North America (28 percent), Africa (26 percent), and Europe (21 percent) also have sizable percentages of borders defined by rivers. For North America, the Rio Grande, which separates Mexico and Texas, accounts for much of that. But the Pigeon River serves as the boundary between parts of Ontario and Minnesota; the Saint Lawrence divides Ontario and New York; and the Saint John River forms part of the boundary between New Brunswick and Maine. Rivers also serve as borders in several African countries: Benin, Nigeria, Senegal, Mauritania, and Niger in West Africa; the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, and Mozambique in Central Africa; and Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Namibia in Southern Africa. In Europe, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Poland, Norway, Bosnia, Romania, and Ukraine are just some of the many countries with international border rivers. </p><p><b>Source 4:</b> The Tigris passes through historical cities like Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad. In ancient times, the Tigris nurtured the Assyrian Empire, with remnants like the relief of King Tiglath-Pileser. The Tigris is home to archaeological sites and ancient religious communities, including the Mandaeans, who use it for baptism. Today, the Tigris faces modern threats from geopolitical instability, dam projects, poor water management, and climate change, leading to concerns about its sustainability. Efforts to protect and preserve the river's legacy are ongoing, with local archaeologists and activists working to safeguard its future. Etymology Bedouin crossing the river Tigris with plunder (c. 1860) The Tigris is 1,750 km (1,090 mi) long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about 25 km (16 mi) southeast of the city of Elazığ and about 30 km (19 mi) from the headwaters of the Euphrates. The river then flows for 400 km (250 mi) through Southeastern Turkey before forming part of the Syria-Turkey border. This stretch of 44 km (27 mi) is the only part of the river that is located in Syria. Some of its affluences are Garzan, Anbarçayi, Batman, and the Great and the Little Zab. Close to its confluence with the Euphrates, the Tigris splits into several channels. First, the artificial Shatt al-Hayy branches off, to join the Euphrates near Nasiriyah. Second, the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir branch off to feed the Central Marshes. Further downstream, two other distributary channels branch off (the Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla), to feed the Hawizeh Marshes. The main channel continues southwards and is joined by the Al-Kassarah, which drains the Hawizeh Marshes. Finally, the Tigris joins the Euphrates near al-Qurnah to form the Shatt-al-Arab. According to Pliny and other ancient historians, the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris. Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, stands on the banks of the Tigris. The port city of Basra straddles the Shatt al-Arab. In ancient times, many of the great cities of Mesopotamia stood on or near the Tigris, drawing water from it to irrigate the civilization of the Sumerians. Notable Tigris-side cities included Nineveh, Ctesiphon, and Seleucia, while the city of Lagash was irrigated by the Tigris via a canal dug around 2900 B.C. Navigation The Tigris has long been an important transport route in a largely desert country. Shallow-draft vessels can go as far as Baghdad, but rafts have historically been needed for transport downstream from Mosul. Management and water quality Batman River The Tigris is heavily dammed in Iraq and Turkey to provide water for irrigating the arid and semi-desert regions bordering the river valley. Damming has also been important for averting floods in Iraq, to which the Tigris has historically been notoriously prone following April melting of snow in the Turkish mountains. Mosul Dam is the largest dam in Iraq. Recent Turkish damming of the river has been the subject of some controversy, for both its environmental effects within Turkey and its potential to reduce the flow of water downstream. Water from both rivers is used as a means of pressure during conflicts. In 2014 a major breakthrough in developing consensus between multiple stakeholder representatives of Iraq and Turkey on a Plan of Action for promoting exchange and calibration of data and standards pertaining to Tigris river flows was achieved. The consensus, known as the 'Geneva Consensus On Tigris River', was reached at a meeting organized in Geneva by the think tank Strategic Foresight Group. In February 2016, the United States Embassy in Iraq as well as the Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi issued warnings that Mosul Dam could collapse. The United States warned people to evacuate the floodplain of the Tigris because between 500,000 and 1.5 million people were at risk of drowning due to flash flood if the dam collapses, and that the major Iraqi cities of Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad were at risk. Religion and mythology In Sumerian mythology, the Tigris was created by the god Enki, who filled the river with flowing water. In Hittite and Hurrian mythology, Aranzah (or Aranzahas in the Hittite nominative form) is the Hurrian name of the Tigris River, which was deified. He was the son of Kumarbi and the brother of Teshub and Tašmišu, one of the three gods spat out of Kumarbi's mouth onto Mount Kanzuras. Later he colluded with Anu and the Teshub to destroy Kumarbi (The Kumarbi Cycle). The Tigris appears twice in the Old Testament. First, in the Book of Genesis, it is the third of the four rivers branching off the river issuing out of the Garden of Eden. The second mention is in the Book of Daniel, wherein Daniel states he received one of his visions 'when I was by that great river the Tigris'. </p>",2025-11-22 02:55:21-08:00,False,Response is valid.
