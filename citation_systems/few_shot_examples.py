\nSub-questions: What's the life cycle of a frog?\
\nSources: \n\".S., Applied Ecology, Indiana University BloomingtonB.S., Biology and Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignLaura Klappenbach, M.S., is a science writer specializing in ecology, biology, and wildlife.Learn about ourEditorial ProcessUpdated on August 11, 2019The life cycle of a frog consists of three stages: egg, larva, and adult. As the frog grows, it moves through these stages in a process known as metamorphosis.\"\
\n\"But in a few species, parents remain with the eggs to look after them as they develop. As the fertilized eggs mature, the yolk in each egg splits into more and more cells and begins to take the form of a tadpole, the larva of a frog. Within one to three weeks, the egg is ready to hatch, and a tiny tadpole breaks free.03of 04Stage 2: Tadpole (Larva)Johner Images / Getty ImagesTadpoles, frogs' larvae, have rudimentary gills, a mouth, and a long tail. For the first week or two after the tadpole hatches, it moves very little. During this time, the tadpole absorbs the remaining yolk left over from the egg, which provides much-needed nourishment. After absorbing the yolk, the tadpole is strong enough to swim on its own.Most tadpoles feed on algae and other vegetation, so they are considered herbivores. They filter material from the water as they swim or tear away bits of plant material. As the tadpole continues to grow, it begins to develop hind limbs.\"\
\n\"The legless, water-bound tadpoles slowly metamorphose into frogs over the next 14 weeks. First, they grow back legs, then front legs too! Soon after, their body starts to change shape, and they’re able to start eating insects. Next, the tadpoles’ tails shrink away, and skin grows over their gills, as they develop lungs and eardrums! These are super important steps, as they prepare the tadpole for life on land. Once their gills and tails are gone forever, tadpoles undergo one last 24-hour push, where the metamorphosis completes. Once this stage is finished, the baby frogs emerge from the water as tiny adults!\"\

\nSub-questions: What are the benefits of hyaluronic acid for skin care?\
\nSources: \n\"Hyaluronic acid is a remarkable substance because of all the benefits and uses \
it has in your body. Here are just a few of the benefits of hyaluronic acid: It helps things move smoothly. Hyaluronic acid helps your joints work like a well-oiled machine. It prevents pain and injury from bones grinding against each other. It helps keep things hydrated.\"\
\n\"Hyaluronic acid is very good at retaining water. A quarter-teaspoon of hyaluronic acid holds about one and a half gallons of water. That’s why hyaluronic acid is often used for treating dry eyes. It’s also used in moisturizing creams, lotions, ointments and serums. It makes your skin flexible. Hyaluronic acid helps skin stretch and flex and reduces skin wrinkles and lines. Hyaluronic acid is also proven to help wounds heal faster and can reduce scarring.\"\

\nSub-questions: What is a heirloom tomato?\
\nSources: \n\"They are classified as family heirlooms, commercial heirlooms, mystery heirlooms, or created heirlooms. They usually have a shorter shelf life and are less disease resistant than hybrids. They are grown for various reasons: for food, historical interest, access to wider varieties, and by people who wish to save seeds from year to year, as well as for their taste.[1]Taste[edit]Many heirloom tomatoes are sweeter and lack a genetic mutation that gives tomatoes a uniform red color at the cost of the fruit's taste.[2] Varieties bearing that mutation which have been favored by industry since the 1940s – that is, tomatoes which are not heirlooms – feature fruits with lower levels of carotenoids and a decreased ability to make sugar within the fruit.\"\
\n\"True heirlooms must be 'old' because they have been a variety for anywhere between 25 and 50 years. The seeds, like furniture or jewelry, must also be passed down from generation to generation. There is no exact blueprint for the color and shape of an heirloom tomato, so long as it meets the three characteristics. There are over 100 different types of heirloom tomatoes in the united states and an estimated 3,000 globally, which are suitable for very different climates and growing regions.\"\

As the frog grows, it moves through these stages in a process known as metamorphosis.\"\
\n\"But in a few species, parents remain with the eggs to look after them as they develop. As the fertilized eggs mature, the yolk in each egg splits into more and more cells and begins to take the form of a tadpole, the larva of a frog. Within one to three weeks, the egg is ready to hatch, and a tiny tadpole breaks free.03of 04Stage 2: Tadpole (Larva)Johner Images / Getty ImagesTadpoles, frogs' larvae, have rudimentary gills, a mouth, and a long tail. For the first week or two after the tadpole hatches, it moves very little. During this time, the tadpole absorbs the remaining yolk left over from the egg, which provides much-needed nourishment. After absorbing the yolk, the tadpole is strong enough to swim on its own.Most tadpoles feed on algae and other vegetation, so they are considered herbivores. They filter material from the water as they swim or tear away bits of plant material. As the tadpole continues to grow, it begins to develop hind limbs.\"\
\n\"The legless, water-bound tadpoles slowly metamorphose into frogs over the next 14 weeks. First, they grow back legs, then front legs too! Soon after, their body starts to change shape, and they’re able to start eating insects. Next, the tadpoles’ tails shrink away, and skin grows over their gills, as they develop lungs and eardrums! These are super important steps, as they prepare the tadpole for life on land. Once their gills and tails are gone forever, tadpoles undergo one last 24-hour push, where the metamorphosis completes. Once this stage is finished, the baby frogs emerge from the water as tiny adults!\"\

In 2002, one curious fan took their question to the company itself and received the following statement in response, 'I'm afraid we can't be very specific because, for competitive reasons, we consider our Juicy Fruit flavoring formula to be a trade secret. I can, however, tell you that the mixture of fruit flavors in Juicy Fruit is comprised of predominately lemon, orange, pineapple, and banana notes.'\"\
\nResponse: \"the mixture of fruit flavors in Juicy Fruit is comprised of predominately lemon, orange, pineapple, and banana notes.\"\n"

To rule those out, you'll need to see a brain doctor, called a neurologist. He'll give you a thorough exam and ask you questions about your symptoms. He'll may also use tests like MRI, CT scans, and nerve tests to see what's causing your symptoms. Treatments for MBA generally aim to relieve symptoms of pain and nausea. You might take pain relievers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen, as well as nausea medicines such as chlorpromazine, metoclopramide, and prochlorperazine. Your doctor may prescribe a medication that treats regular migraines, such as triptans. To keep from getting a MBA,  it helps to avoid the things that usually cause one.\"\n\"Keep a journal of your attacks so you can figure out the things that trigger them. It also helps to live a healthy lifestyle. That means you need to:  Get enough sleep.  Limit your stress.  Exercise daily. Diet can also affect migraines. Do these things:  Eat a balanced diet.  Avoid drugs and alcohol.  Don't skip meals.  Limit caffeine.  Avoid any foods that have been triggers. Some common food triggers include: Dairy Wheat Chocolate Eggs Rye Tomatoes Oranges\"\n\"Along with these changes,  If you don't respond to other treatments and you have 4 or more migraine days a month, your doctor may suggest preventive medicines. You can take these regularly to reduce the severity or frequency of the headaches. These include seizure medicines, blood pressure medicines (like beta blockers and calcium channel blockers), and some antidepressants.

1: "Query: What should I do if my child has a biting injury?\nSub-questions: What should I do if my child has a biting injury?\nSources: \n\"If your child is prone to biting, keep an eye on any playmates and step in when an altercation appears to be brewing. Even with your best prevention efforts, biting incidents might still occur. When your child bites, firmly let your child know that this behavior is not acceptable by saying, \'No. We don't bite!\' Explain that biting hurts the other person. Then remove your child from the situation and give the child time to calm down. You might have heard from other parents that if your child bites you, bite your child back. This isn't good advice. Children learn by imitation. If you bite your child, the child is going to get the impression that this behavior is acceptable and he or she will be more likely to do it again. The same goes for hitting a child for biting. If you are unable to get your child to stop biting, the behavior could begin to have an impact on school and relationships. You or another adult might have to closely supervise interactions between your child and other kids. When biting becomes a habit or continues past age 4 or 5, it might stem from a more serious emotional problem. Talk to your child's health care provider, or enlist the help of a child psychologist or therapist.\"\n\"[1] The first thing to do for any biting injury is to wash the area with soap and water. [2] Even little teeth can break the skin. [3] If the bite is bleeding and the wound appears to be deep, call your child's doctor. [4] The bite may need medical treatment, which could include antibiotics or a tetanus shot, or both.\"\nResponse: \"The first thing to do for any biting injury is to wash the area with soap and water.\" \"Even little teeth can break the skin.\" \"If the bite is bleeding and the wound appears to be deep, call your child's doctor.\" \"The bite may need medical treatment, which could include antibiotics or a tetanus shot, or both.\"\n",

Combat cold symptoms with these home remedies. Get rest. Rest helps the body focus its energy on getting well, so keep kids home from school to keep them warm, and well-rested.\"\n\"Drink lots of fluids. Replenish liquids lost from fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Fluids also help loosen mucus. Use a humidifier. A humidifier in your child's room can keep the air moist and break up nasal and chest congestion. Talk to your pediatrician before giving OTC cold and cough medicines. These medicines should not be given to children under 4 years of age, according to the FDA and the drug makers. Also, evidence indicates medicines such as antihistamines, decongestants, and cough medicines don't really help, but they could pose a small risk of serious side effects.\"\nResponse: \"Talk to your pediatrician before giving OTC cold and cough medicines.\" \"These medicines should not be given to children under 4 years of age, according to the FDA and the drug makers.\" \n",

New skin will form underneath the affected area and the fluid is simply absorbed.\"\n\"Do not puncture a blister unless it is large, painful, or likely to be further irritated.  The fluid-filled blister keeps the underlying skin clean, which prevents infection and promotes healing.  But if you need to pop a blister or it pops by itself: Use a sterilized needle (to sterilize it, put the point or edge in a flame until it is red hot, or rinse it in alcohol).  Wash your hands and the area thoroughly, then make a small hole; the fluid will drain on its own.  If the fluid is white or yellow, the blister may be infected and needs medical attention.  Do not remove the skin over a broken blister.  The new skin underneath needs this protective cover.  Apply an antibiotic ointment or cream.  Look for signs of infection to develop, including pus drainage, red or warm skin surrounding the blister, or red streaks leading away from the blister.\"\n\"Wear work gloves. Jobs you do only occasionally, such as shoveling snow or raking leaves, are great for raising a blister or two. Wear shoes that fit and are comfortable. New shoes should be broken in gradually.

If the bite is bleeding and the wound appears to be deep, call your child's doctor.

Should the bite result in bleeding and a deep injury, consult your child's physician. Such injuries might necessitate medical intervention, potentially involving antibiotics, a tetanus injection, or both.\n",
2: "Query: Can I give cough and cold medicines to children under 4?\nResponse: Talk to your pediatrician before giving OTC cold and cough medicines. These medicines should not be given to children under 4 years of age, according to the FDA and the drug makers.\nParaphrased Response: Consult your pediatrician before giving your child over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.

3: "Query: How do I treat a blister?\nResponse: Most blisters caused by friction or minor burns do not require a doctor's care.

Do not remove the skin over a broken blister. The new skin underneath needs this protective cover. Apply an antibiotic ointment or cream. Look for signs of infection to develop, including pus drainage, red or warm skin surrounding the blister, or red streaks leading away from the blister.\nParaphrased Response: Blisters resulting from friction or minor burns generally don't necessitate medical intervention. Underneath the blister, new skin will develop, and the fluid will naturally be reabsorbed. It's advisable not to burst a blister unless it's sizable, causing discomfort, or at risk of additional irritation. The blister's fluid acts as a barrier, safeguarding the skin beneath from infection and aiding in the healing process. However, if there's a need to drain a blister, or if it bursts on its own, ensure to use a needle that has been sterilized either by heating it until it glows red or by cleansing it with alcohol. Before and after the procedure, clean your hands and the affected area thoroughly, then puncture the blister gently to let the fluid out without forcing it. Should the fluid appear white or yellow, it's indicative of an infection, and medical advice should be sought. Avoid peeling the skin off an opened blister as the new skin underneath requires this natural bandage for protection. Applying an antibacterial ointment or cream is recommended. Stay vigilant for signs of infection such as pus, reddening or warmth around the blister, or red lines emanating from it.\n",

When the headache starts, you might feel an intense throbbing or pulsating pain on one or both sides of your head or sometimes at the back of your head. After you've had at least two attacks of at least two auras, your doctor often make the diagnosis of migraine with brainstem aura. The condition has many of the same symptoms as another type, called hemiplegic migraine. But the hemiplegic kind usually causes weakness of one side of the body or trouble speaking. Symptoms of MBA can also seem like the signs of other more serious conditions, like seizure disorders, stroke, meningitis, or brain tumors. To rule those out, you'll need to see a brain doctor, called a neurologist. He'll give you a thorough exam and ask you questions about your symptoms. He'll may also use tests like MRI, CT scans, and nerve tests to see what's causing your symptoms. Treatments for MBA generally aim to relieve symptoms of pain and nausea. You might take pain relievers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen, as well as nausea medicines such as chlorpromazine, metoclopramide, and prochlorperazine.

Wash your hands and the area thoroughly, then make a small hole; the fluid will drain on its own. If the fluid is white or yellow, the blister may be infected and needs medical attention. Do not remove the skin over a broken blister. The new skin underneath needs this protective cover. Apply an antibiotic ointment or cream. Look for signs of infection to develop, including pus drainage, red or warm skin surrounding the blister, or red streaks leading away from the blister.\nThree short bullet points:\n- Avoid puncturing a blister unless it is likely to be further irritated\n- Do not remove the skin over a broken blister\n- Apply an antibiotic ointment\n",
